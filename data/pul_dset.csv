1,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Juliana Mukankwaya is the mother of six children and the murderer of two, the son and daughter of people she knew since she herself was a child.

Last week, Mukankwaya said, she and other women rounded up the children of fellow villagers they perceived as enemies. With gruesome resolve, she said, they bludgeoned the stunned youngsters to death with large sticks.

""They didn't cry because they knew us,"" said the woman. ""They just made big eyes. We killed too many to count.""

Wearing a black shawl and a blank expression, the slightly built 35-year-old said she was doing the children a favor, since they were now orphans who faced a hard life. Their fathers had been butchered with machetes and their mothers had been taken away to be raped and killed, she said.

Mukankwaya is a member of the Interahamwe, the name for the innumerable Hutu tribal militias that have been blamed for slaughtering an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people since April 6, when a mysterious plane crash killed the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi.

Most of the victims have been members of the minority Tutsi tribe and Hutus perceived as opponents of the government.

Mukankwaya was among 30 peasants from around Kigali, the capital, rounded up in recent days by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Tutsi-dominated rebel army that has captured large chunks of the country since the carnage began.

The people are being held in a former village community center at a small rebel base in Musha, 20 miles northeast of Kigali, the site of fierce artillery battles between the rebels and the government army backed by the Hutu militias.

The rebel commander of this strategic outpost north of Kigali agreed to let The Associated Press interview the militia members. All appeared healthy and there was no evidence of mistreatment.

Lt. Vincent Anyakarundi, a rebel officer, said the captives were being ""re- educated"" rather than punished because they were exhorted and coerced into killing their neighbors. The instigators, he said, were the government, local officials and army soldiers, who the prisoners said supplied them with weapons ranging from clubs to grenades.

""They are peasants"" he said. ""They are just puppets of the government.""

In areas where rebels have seized control, they have appointed political officers to urge people not to listen to exhortations of violence against Tutsis or Hutu foes of the government. The ""re-educators"" have been preaching national unity and the official party line is no reprisals, no revenge and no punishment.

""People who would carry out such massacres, especially against children, are less than animals,"" said Tito Rutaremara, 49, a former party coordinator and leading political influence in the rebel movement. ""You have to teach people to forgive and forget. It's like the Nazis. Most people were behind the Nazis, but you can't punish all the people.""'

Although individual acts of revenge likely have taken place, there have been no independently confirmed instances of mass reprisals.

In Musha, captives gave detailed accounts of the horrors they helped to carry out in their villages, when one part of the community suddenly rose up and destroyed another part.

Virtually all of the prisoners recounted their horrific deeds in dull, emotionless voices, their faces a collection of impassive masks.

Mukankwaya blithely mentioned the names of the parents of the two children she killed during the killing spree that she said left hundreds dead in her village of Nyatovu, just north of Kigali.

Potato and sorghum farmer Alfred Kirukura, 29, said he joined in the murderous orgy in his village of Muhazi, 30 miles north of Kigali, on May 9. He said he took a machete to three childhood pals - one a Tutsi and the others Hutus branded by the locals as anti-government agitators.

As he killed them, ""They said, `We are friends! We shared the same classroom!""' he said.

Maria-Devota Mukazitoni, 24, said she didn't kill anybody in her village of Rutonde, just north of Kigali, but organized the looting of homes after hundreds of people in her town were massacred.

Sixteen-year-old Kitazigurwa - who said he had no first name - said his job was to spy on people saying bad things about the government. People he named were killed.

Joseph Rukwavu, 74, said he was too old to kill anybody but acted as the key authority in his village of Mwuma on people who claimed to be Hutu but whose parents or grandparents were, in fact, Tutsi.

""Two hundred were killed in my sector, even my wife, because she would not join Interahamwe,"" he said in a dull monotone, his face unmoving even as he mentioned his wife's death.

""The militia gathered everybody up near a big hole,"" he said. ""They were weeping, even the men. Even the week before we killed them they were weeping in fear.""

He said the army supplied the villagers with the necessary killing tools and oversaw the slaughter.

""They (the victims) said, `Oh, we are the same people, we are your neighbors. Instead of hiding us you are killing us.""'

Boniface Gasana, 52, said he invited 15 people on the local hit list into his home on the pretense of hiding them, then tipped the village killers of their whereabouts when the massacre began. A woman near him shouted that he also took part.

Even as they spoke, the evening air brought the stench of rotting corpses from the gentle hills around Musha, a common odor throughout the country.

At Kiramuruz, 60 miles northeast of Kigali, 20 bodies lay in a neat row in the woods just outside the seemingly sedate and bustling village.

Resident Vitali Rudasingwa said the people were killed by Hutu militias two weeks ago, even though rebels were in control of the town.

""These militias are still killing people,"" he said. ""But now they are hiding in the corners."""
2,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Nobody lives here any more.

Not the expectant mothers huddled outside the maternity clinic, not the families squeezed into the church, not the man who lies rotting in a schoolroom beneath a chalkboard map of Africa.

Everybody here is dead. Karubamba is a vision from hell, a flesh-and-bone junkyard of human wreckage, an obscene slaughterhouse that has fallen silent save for the roaring buzz of flies the size of honeybees.

With silent shrieks of agony locked on decaying faces, hundreds of bodies line the streets and fill the tidy brick buildings of this village, most of them in the sprawling Roman Catholic complex of classrooms and clinics at Karubamba's stilled heart.

Karubamba is just one breathtakingly awful example of the mayhem that has made beautiful little Rwanda the world's most ghastly killing ground.

Karubamba, 30 miles northeast of Kigali, the capital, died April 11, six days after Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, a member of the Hutu tribe, was killed in a plane crash whose cause is still undetermined.

The paranoia and suspicion surrounding the crash blew the lid off decades of complex ethnic, social and political hatreds. It ignited a murderous spree by extremists from the majority Hutus against rival Tutsis and those Hutus who had opposed the government.

This awesome wave of remorseless mayhem has claimed 100,000 to 200,000 lives, say U.N. and other relief groups. Many were cut down while cowering in places traditionally thought safe havens: churches, schools, relief agencies.

One stroll past the bleached skulls, ripped limbs and sunbaked sinews on the blood-streaked streets of Karubamba gives weight to those estimates.

Almost every peek through a broken window or splintered door reveals incomprehensible horror. A schoolboy killed amid tumbling desks and benches. A couple splattered against a wall beneath a portrait of a serene, haloed Jesus Christ.

Peer into the woods every few hundred feet along the red-clay road to Karubamba and see piles of bodies heaped in decaying clumps.

News from Rwanda has been dominated by accounts of the carnage in Kigali or of millions of refugees living in mud and filth in vast encampments just outside the border. But what happened in Karubamba has happened - and is still happening - in villages across this fertile green nation of velvety, terraced hills.

Survivors from Karubamba say when early word came of the Hutu rampage, people from surrounding towns fled to the seemingly safe haven of the Rukara Parish complex here.

On the night of April 11, the killers swarmed among the neat rows of buildings and began systematically executing the predominantly Tutsi population with machetes, spears, clubs and guns.

""They said, 'You are Tutsi, therefore we have to kill you,'"" said Agnes Kantengwa, 34, who was among dozens holed up inside the yellow-brick church.

""We thought we were safe in church. We thought it was a holy place.""

It wasn't.

Her husband and four children were butchered amid the overturned pews. Bodies stretched to the ornately carved hardwood altar beneath a large crucifix.

Somewhere amid the stinking human rubble is the Rev. Faustin Kagimbura,"" who tried to protect us,"" Kantengwa said.

Down the road, outside the maternity clinic next to the hospital, about 25 bodies lie beneath a cluster of shade trees; most appear to be women, but it is difficult now to be sure.

""They were women waiting to have babies,"" Kantengwa said. ""The killers made them go outside and kneel down, then cut them in the head with machetes and spears. They said, 'You are Tutsi.'""

Mrs. Kantengwa, her 6-year-old son and 6-month-old daughter survived with a mosaic of machete wounds. They share one hospital bed in nearby Gahini, a larger town that breathes bustling life as easily as Karubamba exudes the suffocating stench of month-old death.

At the primary school midway between the maternity clinic and the church, a man lies prone beneath a meticulously drawn blackboard sketch of Africa, the capitals of each nation listed alongside.

Serena Mukagasana, 16, said the man was teacher Matthias Kanamugire.

The girl also was in the church when the slaughter began. By the time it was over, she was an orphan.

""All my family was killed,"" she said. She fled outside during the slaughter and watched from the bushes.

""They just killed and killed,"" she said.

The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front that has been battling the government since 1991 has made huge gains in the countryside since the rampage began.

Their secured areas are relatively stable and well-policed, though scores of villages remain empty and thousands of people line the roads looking for safe places to stop. More than 1.3 million people in this nation of 8 million are displaced.

The rebels took Gahini and set up a base just days after the massacre at Karubamba. It is one of the staging areas for what is believed to be an imminent rebel assault on Kigali, where guerrillas are battling government troops backed by Hutu militias.

Capt. Diogene Mugenge, the rebel commander in Gahini, said an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 people died in the carnage at Karubamba. The only sign of human life in the area is a lone sentry posted roughly where the fresh air begins.

When asked about the massacre, and the fact that mutilated, battered bodies remain frozen in the moment of agonizing death just a few miles from his base, Mugenge shrugs.

""It's happening everywhere,"" he said."
3,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Francois Rwagansana once took well-off Westerners on exotic but safe safaris throughout Africa. But he came home for the ultimate adventure tour: guerrilla warfare.

""It was exciting,"" said Rwagansana, 33, who plies his new trade at a rebel base here, five miles north of the divided capital. He has learned how to survive sickness, carry weeks of food on his back - and break the proper bones of rigid dead enemies to better remove their coveted clothing.

And he has learned how to kill.

""Sometimes I ask myself: What am I doing here?"" said the tall, lanky Rwagansana, a university graduate in sociology smartly dressed in jungle fatigues and Adidas high-top sneakers.

What Rwagansana and others like him are doing is fighting a war against a government they believe has carefully orchestrated the slaughter of what the United Nations estimates is 100,000 to 200,000 people in the past five weeks.

The mind-boggling killing spree broke out after the Hutu president died in a mysterious plane crash. Government soldiers and civilian militias began massacring Tutsis and Hutus perceived as their allies.

At the time, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front had brokered a truce with the government. When the killings began, however, it mobilized its troops and launched a new offensive. It now controls most of this blood-drenched nation of 8 million people.

The complex ethnic and social tensions date to colonial days and the 1959 rebellion by the majority Hutus against the repressive minority Tutsi government.

Thousands of Tutsis fled to Uganda, Zaire, Kenya and Burundi to escape the reprisals that followed, and they raised a lost generation of Rwandan children who formed the core of the rebel army that launched the RPF invasion from Uganda in 1990.

""These young men hardly know their country, hardly know the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi,"" said Tito Rutaremara, 49, a RPF political leader.

""Yet there they are, in the bush, fighting the war,"" he said, gesturing to the lovely green hills filled with thousands of corpses.

To their supporters, the rebels are seen as the cavalry coming to the rescue of a country hemorrhaging rivers of blood.

Human rights organizations and aid workers have uniformly held the Hutu-led militias responsible for most of the carnage in Rwanda The vast majority of victims have been Tutsis, most of them hacked to death with clubs and machetes.

The Tutsi-dominated rebel movement, which includes many Hutus and professes a platform of national unity, has ordered troops to refrain from seeking retribution against Hutu soldiers and civilian militias.

Revenge is officially prohibited, and there have been only scattered, isolated and unconfirmed reports of reprisals.

But Rwagansana, 33, admits the anti-vengeance edict is a hard code to live by.

""You see all those people dead because they were Tutsi, and you make them want to pay,"" said Rwagansana, who left Rwanda as a child and came home from Kenya three years ago. ""Why don't they fight us instead of innocent peasants?""

Guerrilla Eric Ruhumuriza - a 16-year-old, baby-faced kid who looks closer to 12 - struggles with the same emotion. His parents were killed during a massacre in early April. The orphan was quickly adopted by the rebels, who gave him a small uniform and a big AK-47.

""I have a feeling of revenge, but the code prevents it,"" he said as he sat at the rebel base here on Sunday.

Mortar shells boomed in the background as the rebels fired on a government base on the outskirts of Kigali, the capital where large units of government soldiers are based.

The smell of rotting massacre victims in the surrounding fields wafted vthrough the base as the soldiers drank tea and ate rice and beans.

Suddenly a new song came on the radio, its lyrics urging people to kill RPF sympathizers.

""They're still killing innocent people,"" said Capt. Mark Sebaganji, a rebel commander.

Rwagansana says the worst problems he faced with his old job as a tour guide with the U.S.-based Overseas Adventure Travel, were quarreling tourists and broken-down safari vehicles.

""Imagine coming from a city like Nairobi (Kenya) and you find yourself in the bush,"" he said. ""Suddenly, you're just there, and you're attacking people and they're attacking you.

""You sleep outside, there's mosquitoes - I've had malaria twice,"" he said. ""You got a gun, people are shooting and bombs are falling.""

Shortly after he joined the rebels in 1991, Rwagansana said he realized he was in a grim new world when he and a more seasoned rebel approached the body of a dead government soldier.

He found out it was time to resupply.

""He broke the bones at the elbow and took the shirt, then he took the pants and the boots,"" he said. ""I asked myself: Could I do that?"""
4,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"They were trained, armed and programmed to explode, a human doomsday device designed to detonate on command.

The extremist Hutu militias responsible for many of the 200,000 deaths in Rwanda were forged more than a year ago as a chilling final solution to ancient ethnic animosities and modern political pressures, former government officials say.

These secret civilian armies - which the government purportedly claimed at one point were being trained as park rangers - were the creation of Hutu President

Juvenal Habyarimana, who continued to arm them even as he negotiated peace with his Tutsi-dominated enemies.

When he died in a mysterious plane crash on April 6, his murder machine thundered to terrifying life in every corner of this crowded little country, killing minority Tutsis and Hutus deemed opponents of the government.

The switch has yet to be shut off.

""We warned the international community that this was happening, that these people were being trained and armed to kill great numbers of people,"" said former Finance Minister Marc Rugenera, one of the Social Democrats Habyarimana had been pressured to include in his Cabinet.

Holly Burkhalter, Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said it was well known that the massacres were carried out by people ""armed and trained by the Rwandan army."" She said the army training had gone on ""for a couple of years and there were many, many reports that it was very organized.""

The Rwanda massacres came at a time when post-Cold War pressures for multiparty democracy collided horribly with ingrained ethnic animosities and internal power struggles.

The majority Hutus were traditionally farmers whose dominance by the tall cattle herders known as the Tutsi - also known as the Watutsi - dates back centuries.

Belgium, which took control of the country after World War I, favored the Tutsis with better educations and jobs for 40 years, fanning the fires of the 1959 Hutu revolt that toppled the Tutsi government and led to bloody reprisals against the minority.

In 1990, Tutsi exiles led a well-equipped rebel army into the country from Uganda.

Many of them had become high-ranking soldiers in the army of former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin and the guerrilla army that put current Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in power.

Habyarimana, a Hutu hardliner, came under international pressure to make peace with the rebels and open his government to opposition parties.

After bitter negotiations, Habyarimana gave 10 Cabinet posts to opposition parties in April 1992 and three months later opened talks with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front in Arusha, Tanzania.

The 34 months of negotiations were disrupted by repeated broken cease-fires, sporadic fighting, threats and acrimonious meetings, but ultimately resulted in a power-sharing agreement.

But the last year also marked the recruitment, training and arming of extremist Hutus from virtually every village, Rugenera said.

During one breakdown in peace talks in Arusha a year ago, Rugenera said opposition figures got an inkling of what was to come from a comment made by Col. Theoneste Bagosora of the elite presidential guard, which reputedly ignited the massacres.

""He said he was going back to Kigali to prepare for the apocalypse,"" Rugenera said.

There were numerous other threats by Hutu hardliners that Tutsis would be killed and float back to their ethnic homeland via the Kagera River, a warning borne out by the bodies that now fill Rwanda's waterways.

Opposition figures said they complained nearly a year ago that Hutu extremists were being trained at secret sites at the Kagera National Park in the northeast and the town of Gisenyi near the Zairean border.

Rugenera said at one point the government said the militias were learning to be park rangers.

""We knew something would happen. But we didn't know the day or the scope,"" said Joseph Nsengimana, 43, a member of the governing board of the opposition Liberal Party.

""Habyarimana said repeatedly that if the RPF were to take power, they would find their families dead.""

Sporadic killings of Tutsis by terror groups broke out in mid-1993 and escalated in early 1994, including a massacre of hundreds in January.

Rwandans will debate for generations whether or how Habyarimana intended to use the militias had he lived. Rugenera believes they would have been used to disrupt multiparty elections or bring havoc if the opposition won an election or the rebels won the war.

Opposition parties and the rebels deny shooting down or blowing up the plane carrying Habyarimana, and contend that he was instead killed by his own people to thwart the Arusha accord he had signed.

""Habyarimana was caught in his own trap,"" contended Denis Polisi, a rebel spokesman. ""He had to keep arming his militias and he had to accept democratic reforms, but he couldn't do both.""

But while the rebels and opposition leaders say they had no reason to kill Habyarimana, they also paradoxically cite the militias as proof that he had no intention of honoring the power-sharing accord with the RPF.

Whoever killed him, his death plunged Rwanda into one of history's most incomprehensible series of massacres.

""The presidential guard began it when they went to kill the (opposition party) government ministers,"" Rugenera said. ""First they killed their kids and wives.""

Rugenera is a Hutu member of the Social Democrats and not affiliated with the Tutsi-dominated rebels. He was one of the few ministers who lived in his own house, rather than an official residence, and said he managed to escape to the home of a German neighbor.

He fled Kigali, taking advantage of the chaos when the rebels moved close to the city.

Militias, many of them operating in their own villages, pulled out their lists of names of Tutsis and anti-government Hutus and began separating women, men and children and killing them with guns, grenades, special knobby clubs, machetes, spears, bows and arrows and at least one sharpened umbrella.

""It was a plan of genocide that had been prepared a long time,"" said Polisi. ""We warned the embassies, the (Roman Catholic) church, the EC (European Community) months before, but nobody listened.""

Nsengimana, 43, a former university art professor, said he had a routine meeting with an RPF official inside the parliament building in Kigali when Habyarimana died. He said he was trapped inside while massacres erupted, followed by fighting between the approaching rebels and regular army soldiers.

""In the morning we were informed that important persons had been killed,"" he said. ""I called my wife and she said her brother had been killed with all of his family.""

Rebels took the parliament building and Nsengimana was escorted to Byumba, the rebel-held town north of Kigali where most of the opposition ministers now live.

Nsengimana said he is still waiting for word on his wife and children, who were at home.

""I asked the RPF to look at my home. It was empty. When they went to the house next door, it was filled with cadavers,"" he said, his face twisting into tears. ""I have asked them to look again."""
5,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Dad was drowned in a cattle dip and mom was taken away by a man with a machete. But 14-year-old Donata Nyinshimiye was singing as she walked to get water with her new family.

Twelve kids from different towns and ethnic backgrounds clanged their containers and their voices together as they trooped down main street toward the water pump in the center of this town 70 miles southeast of Kigali.

Singing, they walked to a mass grave sealed over with red soil by a yellow bulldozer - a single left arm reaching out from the ground.

Singing, they walked past the homes of the dead, ransacked by fanatical militias still looking for some reminder of their enemies to destroy.

They were children being children, oblivious for the moment to the signs of carnage around them and the ghastly personal losses they each suffered.

The massacres that broke out after President Juvenal Habyarimana died in an unexplained plane crash on April 6 have left few families intact among the minority Tutsis and anti-government Hutus who were targeted for slaughter.

Entire villages and neighborhoods were wiped out in the days that followed, their inhabitants killed with guns and hand grenades or hacked and clubbed to death by extremist Hutu militias bent on avenging the death of their president.

The remnants of tens of thousands of shattered families are frantically trying to reunite, wandering great distances in search of blood links. In some cases children themselves are building desperate little units without parents to watch over them.

Rose Kayumba, who runs an orphanage in Byumba, said nearly every day small groups of children show up at the gate, without parents or siblings, only each other.

Jennifer Wibabara, a reporter for a radio station run by the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, puts people on the air who are desperate to find somebody from the family.

""They say `It's me, I'm alive,""' she said. ""But rarely do people come forward.""

In Gahini, about 45 miles northeast of Kigali, the Bwakeyebute family now only consists of father Benoit and 6-year-old son David. Bwakeyebute watched as militias cut the throat of his wife four weeks ago. He tried to flee, but the killers hacked at his face and arms and then left him for dead.

""An old woman with a goat found me,"" said Bwakeyebute, his right arm in a cast and his left arm and face tattooed with wounds.

His son, spared by the killers, was standing nearby when he regained consciousness.

The 12 young people walking in a tight little knot down the main street of Kibungo ranged in age from 5-year-old Francine Mahoro, a wide-eyed waif in dirty white dress, to 17-year-old Cesare Nyirabashumba, a rail-thin woman who stood more than 6 feet tall.

""I'm the leader,"" Nyirabashumba, a Tutsi, said of her charges, who were both Hutu and Tutsi.

Some came from this town, where survivors say at least 1,000 people were massacred in the local Roman Catholic Church on April 17, loaded into trucks and buried in a pit atop one of the green hills nestling the city.

Others walked from as far away as Rusumo and Sake, towns near the Burundi border 50 miles away, to escape the militias.

All came together at a nearby hospital that was turned into a refugee camp. Asked how many had lost one or both parents, eight of the 12 raised their hands.

Donata Nyinshimiye was from Rusumo, where she had the living nightmare of watching men grab her cattle herder father, drag him into the deep trench of chemicals used to cure cattle of parasites, and hold him under until the bubbles stopped.

""I'm alone,"" she said.

Prosper Rudasingwa, 10, who comes from Kibungo, said he's the only male member of his family left alive. His three brothers and father were killed, and his mother is missing. He was with his two little sisters.

Kibungo, a modern-looking town of neat brick buildings, a post office and large electrical power plant that supplied power nationwide, was seized by rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front on April 20.

The Tutsi-dominated rebels have been battling the Hutu-led government they blame for inflicting the carnage across this nation the size of Maryland. Aid agencies say most of the massacres were carried out by the Interahamwe, the government-backed civilian militias that attacked in nearly every village.

The children said they have a deep fear of the Interahamwe. During their mile-long walk for water, a group of men they believed were militia members shouted obscenities at them.

""We're always worried they will finish us off,"" said Nyirabashumba, wearing a baseball cap with a BMW logo.

The raggedy youngsters then walked on down the road to fill their odd assortment of plastic containers. Trudging along, they started singing again."
6,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Steve Shyaka and partners sell beans in the big city and beer in the boondocks, shuttling the goods aboard their own Boeing 727. They use profits earned in the chaos of Zaire to finance the war in Rwanda.

""We do our part. We are Tutsis. We are an RPF airline,"" said the smiling, bespectacled businessman, a Tutsi tribesman who was born in Zaire but considers himself a member of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front.

Shyaka, 27, is part of Zaire's large Rwandan community, made up of both Hutus and Tutsis with blood ties to the inflamed little nation dying horribly on this country's eastern border.

Now, the conflict in Rwanda threatens to spill into Zaire. It is a vast, virtually ungoverned land one-third the size of the United States with a bubbling stew of its own ethnic conflicts, marauding soldiers and breakaway provinces.

""Since Zaire shares a frontier with Rwanda, when there are problems there, there is insecurity here,"" said Leon Kengo wa Dondo, one of two men who claim to be prime minister of Zaire.

France's decision to send its troops through Zaire into Rwanda is just another complication in the slow but steady implosion of social and economic order in this nation of 40 million people.

The main opposition group in Zaire blames France for supporting the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, just as the Tutsi-dominated rebels in Rwanda blame Paris for arming the majority Hutu government.

""France is instigating the situations in both countries,"" declared Frederic Kibassa Maliba, chairman of the main opposition coalition, Sacred Union. France insists its intentions in Rwanda are purely humanitarian.

Right now, though, Rwanda is just a blip on Zaire's radar screen.

Zaire has seen influxes of refugees from wars in neighboring Sudan, Uganda and Angola in addition to Rwanda and Burundi. But its most intractable problems remain within its own borders, where the political impasse between Mobutu and his opponents has left Zaire lawless and abandoned by its Western benefactors.

""We are in a complex emergency situation,"" said Isaac Gomez, director of the U.N. Children's Fund here. ""Zaire is a failed state. Everybody does what he wants. Children are dying from numerous epidemics. You have looting all over the country. In the regions, all these ethnic conflicts. There is complete confusion.""

Zaire seemed poised for progress in 1991, when a national conference elected opposition leader Etiene Tshisekedi as prime minister. Mobutu tried to fire him, and has named four men as prime minister in the last four years.

The most recent edition was Kengo, who served as prime minister for most of the 1980s under Mobutu and was elected to the post by Parliament last week.

Kengo said he is willing to compromise with Tshisekedi, who has enough public support to be an obstructionist but probably not enough to seize the country by sheer numbers.

""I have given my hand to Tshisekedi,"" Kengo said. ""I am open to him. I am waiting for him to give me some members for my government.""

Tshisekedi, whose rigid resistance to compromise has increasingly eroded his opposition coalition and alienated his Western supporters, will have none of it.

""He asked to see me, but I said 'No,""' said Tshisekedi. ""If the people don't accept that government, it can't exist.""

There is growing evidence that the people no longer care. In Kinshasa, the capital, the informal economy of bartering, bribing and begging flourishes even as social order, health and nutrition plunge.

Parents have pooled their money to persuade professors to return to the main university. Mothers are turning plots of urban earth into gardens. Neighborhoods are organizing road crews to patch potholes.

""The crisis has given way toa lot of creativity,"" Gomez said. ""People are finding ways and means to survive.""

Abruptly and somewhat inexplicably focusing on France rather than rallying the masses against Mobutu, Kibassa's pro-Tshisekedi group last month called for a boycott of French products. He said in an interview that the opposition will begin trying to ""peacefully"" persuade French people to leave the country.

Rwanda, meanwhile, looms on the eastern horizon. At the border, relief agencies are bracing for an influx of refugees.

The fleeing Hutu-led government reportedly has already moved to Gesenyi, just a few miles from the Zairean town of Goma.

Rwandans fleeing into Zaire probably could expect a brutal welcome.

Last year, ethnic Zairians launched a campaign of terror against ethnic Rwandans already living there who had clamored for land rights in the eastern Zairean region north of Lake Kivu.

Relief groups say an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 people died in the massacres and revenge killings that erupted in the hills of eastern Zaire from May to August 1993. An estimated 350,000 people were displaced.

UNICEF project officer Juan Carlos Espinola said aid groups had just succeeded in placating the situation and returning displaced people when neighboring Burundi exploded in violence last November, sending about 90,000 ethnic Hutus from that country into eastern Zaire south of Lake Kivu.

The ethnic killings in Burundi were followed by the carnage that erupted in Rwanda after the death of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6.

Only about 4,000 Tutsis have fled into the eastern Zaire town of Goma since then, but relief groups say they are starting to see more Hutus filtering in.

Rwandan President Theodore Sindikubwabo and his ministers visited Kinshasa last week and met with government officials. But Rwandan Ambassador Etienne Senegegera denied the Hutus were benefiting from Zairean aid, a claim made both by Zairean Tutsis and the anti-Mobutu opposition.

However, relief groups allege that arms are moving through Goma into Hutu territory near the border. The fact that French troops planned to enter Rwanda from Goma has raised suspicions that they are aiding the Hutu side of the war.

Shyaka and his two Tutsi business partners don't deny they are using part of the profits from their airline, Gomair, to help the rebels. The three men come from Goma, where their parents fled after the Hutu rebellion against Tutsi rule in Rwanda in 1959.

""We are businessmen, but we are also Tutsis,"" said Shyaka."
7,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Lt. Col. Edward Gasarabwe is charged with keeping the government's shrinking piece of Rwanda from being cut in half by the rebels - a battle he expects to win if the French keep moving deeper into Rwanda.

France says it has come to Rwanda for humanitarian reasons. But the Hutu commander said the French army that once trained his officers could, by its mere presence, thwart the rebels' wildly successful tactic of indirect jabs and infiltration of the army's flanks.

""We won't have to retreat anymore,"" Gasarabwe said in an unusually frank interview Monday about his army's crippled supply lines and numerous retreats, its training of murderous civilian militias and its difficulties in smuggling adequate arms from neighboring Zaire.

Gasarabwe took over the command of four battalions of 2,800 troops at a critical front-line position in south-central Rwanda on Friday, part of a massive reshuffling of the beleaguered national army.

""The rebels are moving too fast,"" said Gasarabwe, 39. ""I'm here to stop them. If I don't, I'm gone.""

He has set up his command post in a small house on a hill just 2,000 yards from the nearest rebel position to send a message to a battered national army suddenly buoyed by the reassuring presence of France, which armed and trained the troops when the rebels first launched their rebellion four years ago.

""I set my command post so close to the front to keep my men from leaving,"" he said.

On Saturday, the rebels launched a raid on the command post and got within 1,000 yards, said Maj. Gerard Ntanagezo, Gasarabwe's aide.

The national army, dominated by the majority Hutu people, is battling the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Tutsi-led rebel movement that launched an invasion from Uganda in December 1990.

Gasarabwe said he was the army's training instructor at the time and worked closely with the French military advisers.

The two sides reached a preliminary peace accord last year. But the April 6 death of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious plane crash ignited a wave of massacres.

An estimated 200,000 people, most of them Tutsis and many of them women and children, have been killed.

The RPF renewed its rebellion after the massacres began and has steadily pushed the government army to the western border. The national army only controls one- third of the country and lost key sections of the capital, Kigali, and the strategic city of Gitarama in the past month.

Gasarabwe was the commander of the former government stronghold of Byumba, which fell two months ago. He said the army ""sacrificed"" the city in order to send additional troops to Kigali, but it subsequently suffered serious setbacks there.

Rwankuba is a small village packed with troops about 13 miles from Gitarama and some 30 miles southwest of Kigali. Gasarabwe's troops are defending a critical area from just south of Gitarama to the southwestern city of Butare.

Soldiers are dug into the hills, trading machine gun and mortar fire with rebel forces on the nearby hills.

They are defending the key east-west road from Gitarama to the Zairean border town of Kibuye, which if captured would split the government territory in two.

Gasarabwe said he also is trying to recapture the main north-south road 12 miles away that connects Gitarama to Kigali and the capital to Uganda, the main rebel supply route.

A key to his success, he said, is the French troops. He said the army has been forced to retreat in order to protect civilian populations from the quick raids the rebel guerrillas have carried out on the army's flanks and infiltration of the civilian population behind the front-line troops.

With the French defending the civilian population and the flanks, he said the army could concentrate on the front.

""The French are going to take care of the people,"" he said. ""If the French are protecting the population we won't have to back up. The French are not in the fighting zone yet, so we don't know what is going to happen.

""It depends on what the French mission actually is,"" he said - something wondered by much of the world.

Gasarabwe was blunt about the shape of his army. The rebel advances have crippled supply lines and the rebels have more weapons. He figures his force of 2,800 soldiers is facing three or four rebel battalions.

The arms being smuggled through Zaire, he said, ""are not enough.""

""I don't understand why there is an international blockade against my troops and not the RPF,"" he said. ""They say we are massacring people, so there is a blockade. It's unfair that Uganda supplies the RPF.""

The rebels have portrayed themselves as coming to save the nation from massacres of Tutsis and Hutus considered RPF supporters.

Most of the massacres have been blamed on the Hutu militias that Gasarabwe acknowledged were formed and trained by the military, but only to detect RPF infiltrators, he said.

""The military did organize the militias. It was necessary for civilian defense,"" he said. ""The RPF infiltrated. It's not possible for the military to protect all the population. It was up to the militias.""

""That was the reason for the massacres, to remove the infiltration threat,"" he said. ""There are people who support the RPF even here.""

Though massacre survivors disagree, he said the army did not take part in mass killings.

The appalling level of slaughter in villages across the country drew unprecedented attention to this tiny Central African country. Gasarabwe conceded that perhaps some innocent people were killed during the purported purges of RPF supporters.

""Yes. If someone goes into RPF territory to get food, then comes back, it's hard to say if they were RPF.""

He said the rebels have killed more innocent people and have used skilled propaganda to win global support, installing a Hutu as its president to give the appearance that the rebellion is multiethnic.

""The RPF initially said it was fighting to return Tutsi refugees home, then they began incorporating Hutus so it wouldn't be said it was an ethnic problem,"" he said. ""They were very smart to select as their president a Hutu. That man won't live long, because the Tutsis will kill him.""

He said the national army also has Tutsis in its ranks, though none in command posts. He said there have been ethnic conflicts within the ranks.

""Some of their families were massacred, and they were angry,"" he said. ""We're trying to sensitize people. The Hutu-Tutsi problem is not really a concern of the army. Historically, the Hutus and the Tutsis have never really understood each other."""
8,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"With the arrival of French troops, relief agencies are moving deeper into the most forbidding parts of Rwanda and starting to find the mysterious half-million refugees they knew existed but couldn't locate.

But they say precious few of them are Tutsis, giving further weight to fears that the minority group was virtually wiped out in the one-third of the country controlled by the majority Hutu government.

""We find some minorities but not a lot,"" said Ariane Tombet, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Rwanda. ""It's in the hundreds.""

A United Nations report Thursday blamed the Rwandan government for planning a genocide of Tutsis and opposition Hutus and recommended international war crimes charges be brought against the Hutu forces.

In this oppressive border town, guarded by abusive and drunken government soldiers and customs authorities, few locals will talk frankly about the anti-Tutsi killings that erupted across Rwanda after April 6, when Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana died in an unexplained plane crash.

""The militias are not killing civilians as such. What they are doing is looking for enemy soldiers,"" said Phocas Fashaho, 30, who said he was a former interpreter for U.N. peacekeeping units in Kigali, the besieged capital.

But across the narrow southern tip of giant Lake Kivu, in the Zairean resort town of Bukavu, witnesses and relief officials remember the carnage in Cyangugu.

""We documented about 16,000 to 17,000 killings,"" said N. Vander Eecken, head ofthe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees delegation in Bukavu. ""Outside of Kigali, this is the worst place. They are all killers there.""

French troops last week launched their peace-keeping mission in Cyangugu, where Hutus cheered their arrival. They were pleased to see soldiers from a government that helped finance and run their defense of the 1990 Tutsi rebellion.

""We're dealing with the devil. They killed all Tutsis,"" said Vander Eecken, who has to deal on a regular basis with the Cyangugu authorities.

""Huts were burning in the hills. Trucks carried bodies,"" he said, describing the view of Cyangugu from Bukavu. ""And people were still water-skiing on the lake.""

The French troops' first action in Rwanda was to make a carefully publicized visit to a camp in Nyarushishi, where 8,000 Tutsis amazingly survived in the middle of extremist Hutu territory, under the guard of 11 policemen.

Vander Eecken said he believes the camp is probably the biggest anywhere in government territory, and that the people there were being kept as prisoners and bargaining chips.

French troops since then have found only small pockets of hiding Tutsis, none of whom lived among the general population.

Relief workers have complained about France's intervening in a conflict in which it has a historical bias. The aid group Doctors of the World was forced out by the Rwandan government for criticizing the French arrival.

But the aid agencies clearly have taken advantage of the slightly more relaxed atmosphere among the Hutu militias and government soldiers, who are happy to see their old allies just as the rebels had them on the run.

""Before the French came, the (militias) were more intense, more aggressive,"" said Alison Campbell, a CARE spokeswoman.

Relief agencies and aid workers are pumping one another and journalists for information on where to find the estimated 500,000 people who supposedly were on the run from the rebels' recent advances.

An estimated 250,000 mostly Hutu refugees were found in the past week in the Gikongoro region, most of them from the rebel-battered cities of Kigali and Gitarama. The Red Cross plans to begin a massive feeding program next week.

An estimated 2 million people have been driven from their homes in Rwanda either Tutsis fleeing Hutus or Hutus fleeing the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels.

The difference between the two territories is striking. In rebel territory, refugees are organized by civilian rebel officials who instruct village elders to assign specific jobs, such as food gathering and hut-building.

The many rebel checkpoints are organized, disciplined and sober, staffed by generally businesslike uniformed rebels.

""The RPF from the beginning got very involved with the agencies,"" Campbell said.

In government areas, great crosscurrents of refugees seem to alight en masse by collective decision, on the sides of hills and edges of towns, squeezed and scattered randomly. They generally fend for themselves and must pass the scrutiny of youthful Hutu militiamen who are little more than thugs.

Relief workers have to go through layers of corrupt bureaucracy to deliver critical food and medical supplies.

""It would be beneficial if we had some indication of the government's position on these huge numbers of people. Or will we have to continue to be involved in tedious negotiations with local officials?"" Campbell said.

Some fear that the rebel push may eventually drive this Hutu heartland into Zaire, where many minority Tutsis have settled. Last year, resentful Zaireans massacred thousands of Tutsis.

Overlooked among the Rwandan refugees are 22,000 Zaireans who had been living and working in Rwanda when war and mass murder broke out.

Many came to Bukavu, like Aloys Sema, 35, who was teaching English at the main university in the southern Rwandan city of Butare when the mass hunt for Tutsis began.

Sema said he saw babies put into the massive mortars used to pound cassava and rice, then beaten to a pulp.

""It was horrible,"" he said. ""I don't have words to describe it. Maybe there will be Tutsis hiding there, but I don't think they will find many."""
9,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"Bernard Sebazzogue watched as cholera killed his daughter on Monday, his wife on Tuesday and his grandmother Thursday. By week's end, he gathered up his three remaining children and fled for help. To Rwanda.

What lay before him, rising from the dirt over the first 50 miles into his country, were five hospitals that began springing up just a few days before Sebazzogue's family began dying.

These outposts at Goma's doorstep are part of a quick and somewhat haphazard effort to create a corridor of health care in Rwanda from which more than 1 million people fled over several panicked days in early July.

This rapidly emerging row of waystations is meant to act both as an inducement for people to leave the fetid corpse factories in Goma for the relatively open and sparsely populated spaces over the border, and to stop them from spreading cholera - death by dehydration - deep into Rwanda.

Sebazzogue was one of a relative handful of Rwandan Hutus who allowed desperation to overcome fear of what might happen in Rwanda where a rebel army comprised mainly of minority Tutsis has won control of the country after Hutu massacres left between 350,000 and 500,000 people dead, most of them Tutsis.

""Help the world return the people!"" Sebazzogue shouted angrily Friday as he and his daughters trudged down the road toward the first outpost, run by the French aid group Doctors Without Borders. ""Otherwise they will all die!""

So far, the rate of returnees has been slow, and some medical relief workers fear the massive aid being poured into Goma may act as an inducement to keep people from returning. ""In refugee situations, people just tend to stay where the help is,"" said Tom Turley, a logistics expert for the U.S. relief group AmeriCares. ""The more the situation improves, the more refugee populations become permanent.""

Refugees are also subjected to steady doses of propaganda and intimidation from officials in the former Hutu government, who are resisting repatriation efforts as long as the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front holds power.

None of the refugees or relief workers spoken to had complaints about the former rebels, who now represent the government army. Their numerous road checkpoints were largely professional and organized, in contrast to the oppressive and threatening mood under the ousted government.

""It's becoming very clear that the countries putting all their efforts into the humanitarian situation should try and put the same effort into the political situation,"" said Panos Moumtzis, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman.

The scenic hills from the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi to just beyond the city of Ruhengeri 40 miles away are certainly seeing their share of humanitarian money, though so far only a relative trickle of refugees.

The stretch includes three clinics set up by Doctors Without Borders and the sites for two more facilities: a 300-bed unit that the British army planned to build on Sunday in Ruhengeri, and a clinic that the relief agency AmeriCares planned to erect by Monday. Further down the road is a barely functioning clinic that had been operated for years by Spanish nuns.

""You know, sometimes it seems that the left hand doesn't know what the right one is doing,"" said AmeriCares volunteer Mike Jones after he was told about the British hospital going up simultaneously just down the road.

The pace was slow at a clinic and dispensary run by Doctors Without Borders in Ruhengeri. At Murtura, about eight miles east of Goma, only a few dozen people were waiting at a Doctors Without Borders clinic that opened last week.

Nurse Maureen Mulhern, in Murtura, said about 200 patients were treated for a variety of afflictions, like dehydration and dysentery, but that the number per day had fallen to about 120 by later in the week.

There's not so many coming. The cholera epidemic is getting a little better under control in Goma, so the impetus for coming back has subsided a bit,"" she said.

But about 15 miles east of Ruhengeri, on a flat plateau at the top of a hill, AmeriCares workers were unloading and safeguarding $100,000 in medicines and the parts needed for an expandable, domed aluminum health clinic.

About 20 Rwandans looking frail and weak stood by, and one woman lay ill in the grass, all waiting for the hospital to go up.

""If all these people decide to come back home, we're gonna need as many hospitals as we can get,"" said AmeriCares volunteer Jones."
10,AP,Fritz,1995,Rwanda Ethnic Violence,"A lost nation of Tutsi exiles is returning by the thousands to the country that once meant death for them.

Some of the returnees haven't seen the country since 1959, when a violent rebellion by the majority Hutus ended centuries of domination and drove tens of thousands of Tutsis into neighboring nations.

Now, Tutsi exiles are flooding back, arriving by the bus-load and on foot, congregating at government processing centers, moving into abandoned homes and bringing with them the old fears of minority domination.

After surviving the April massacres that killed as many as 500,000 people, most of them Tutsis, and ousting the Hutu government with a rebel army last month, this returning diaspora is moving into areas largely abandoned by Hutus.

Hundreds of thousands of Hutus now live in misery and fear in the squalid, deadly camps in Zaire, Tanzania and in the section of southwestern Rwanda carved out by the French army.

There is very little traffic between the French security zone, populated overwhelmingly by Hutus, and the areas that surround it run by the Tutsi- dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front.

With the French preparing to leave on Aug. 22, relief agencies fear the Hutus in the security zone could flee en masse into Bukavu, in eastern Zaire, rivaling the catastrophe of last month's exodus into Goma, Zaire.

Very few Hutus in the French zone city of Gikongoro are willing to travel the 12 miles to the tilled fields and open spaces around Butare, which is filling up quickly with Tutsis.

Many are driven here both by the RPF victory and the worsening ethnic conflict between Tutsis and Hutus in Burundi to the south.

""The situation in Burundi has become unbearable, but even if it wasn't I would return to Rwanda,"" said Faustin Gesgona, 62, as he cleared rubble from a battered store in downtown Butare.

""This is where my family will live now that the RPF is in charge.""

Gesgona arrived on Saturday for the first time since his family fled in 1960. He said the new local government assigned him the store as temporary living quarters.

In Gitarama to the north, Dr. Fred Tagwa, 34, came from Uganda last week and drifted among the empty buildings, looking for a place to bring his family. His parents fled the anti-Tutsi purges of 1959 and Tagwa was making his first visit to the country.

""My parents come from the villages in the hills, but I have no desire to go there,"" the physician said. ""The killers are still there.""

Though the Tutsis and Hutus are trying to negotiate an orderly aftermath to the French departure - the French soldiers already are being replaced by U.N. peacekeepers from Chad and Ghana - they also are waging a Cold War-style propaganda campaign against each other.

French officers in Gikongoro said there have been repeated instances of Hutus being killed when they tried to cross into the RPF zone.

""We know people are being killed,"" said Lt. Col. Erik de Stabenrath, the French commander in Gikongoro.

Last week, Stabenrath gave a U.N. human rights team reports of alleged RPF- sanctioned massacres of returning Hutus, including the purported killings of 63 people who had spent the night in the Butare veterinary school.

Each of the reports was based on an account by a Hutu refugee who claimed to have witnessed the killings and then fled back to the French zone.

Stabenrath also said he saw the bodies of 15 dead Hutu civilians he said were killed by RPF soldiers near the city of Kunin. Pressed for details, he said he saw the bodies from a helicopter and assumed they were killed by rebels because they had just seized the area.

The assistant prefect of Butare, Boniface Ukuri, called the allegations ""malicious propaganda"" from a French government that armed and financed the former Hutu government.

He also denied that the RPF was preventing Hutus from returning home or giving their homes to the arriving Tutsis.

He would not, however, allow a reporter to visit the veterinary school because he said his boss was out of town.

Ukuri and other national officials acknowledge there have been isolated and unauthorized reprisal killings, and that suspected killers have been arrested. But they deny there is an organized campaign of vengeance.

At the refugee camps north of Gikongoro, some Hutus say they tried to return to their homes in the RPF zone and instead narrowly escaped being murdered in their native villages.

At the Kaduha camp, Victor Rurangirwa, 36, said he returned last week to his village of Nyarugenge and was taken prisoner by RPF soldiers.

He said 20 people were slaughtered with garden hoes, but he managed to escape and return to the camp 50 miles away. He supplied a list of six victims he said he knew.

In Nyarugenge, where both returning Tutsis and Hutus were living in seeming calm, people from both groups said they were unaware of any reprisal killings.

""I feel safe with the soldiers here,"" said Evode Nodayisenga, 19, a Hutu from one of the small villages around Ntongwe, where many of the Kaduha camp dwellers say there have been bloody revenge killings.

He said he attended meetings where local Tutsis and Hutus gather so the survivors of killings can name the killers and take them off to jail.

""It's no problem here for the normal people. Only the killers,"" he said."
11,Christian Science Monitory,Rohde,1996,Bosnia Muslim Massacre,"An on-the-spot investigation by The Christian Science Monitor has uncovered strong evidence that a massacre of Bosnian Muslim prisoners took place last month.

A Monitor reporter, traveling without the permission of rebel Bosnian Serbs, looked into charges by American officials that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Muslims were killed by the Serbs after they overran two UN-protected ""safe areas.""

The Serbs deny the US charges, which were based on spy-satellite photos.

The visit by this reporter was the first by a Western journalist to the sites of the alleged atrocities near the former safe areas of Srebrenica and Zepa. The physical evidence was grim and convincing:

At one site shown in the spy photos this reporter saw what appeared to be a decomposing human leg protruding from the freshly turned dirt.

Large, empty ammunition boxes littered the open fields where the ground recently had been dug.

Diplomas, photos, and other personal effects of Srebrenica Muslims were scattered near the areas of disturbed earth.

At a soccer stadium in a nearby town, human feces, blood, and other evidence indicated large numbers of persons were confined, and perhaps shot.

UN officials estimate that 4,000 to 6,000 Muslim men are still missing in the wake of the Srebrenica and Zepa assaults. So far there is little indication that these men are being held prisoner. Dozens of local Bosnian Serb civilians and soldiers, most of them unaware they were speaking to a foreign journalist's translator, said they had heard nothing about a large group of captives from the former enclaves.

According to Bosnian Serb troops, all Muslims captured in the area are being summarily executed. One soldier, reporting to his commanding officers in Nova Kasaba, said a group of more than 300 Muslims who were armed with only 50 guns are still hiding in the hills around the village of Cerska, near Zepa.

The soldier proudly declared that his unit had captured seven of these Muslims last Saturday and killed two. ""We're going back to catch the group tomorrow,"" said the soldier. ""We just talk to them and then shoot them.""

US officials first made public charges about alleged atrocities by Bosnian Serbs in this area on Aug. 10. In a closed session of the UN Security Council, US ambassador to the UN Madeline Albright said that as many as 2,700 Bosnian Muslims might have been hastily executed and buried in shallow graves.

In a dramatic presentation of evidence, Ms. Albright displayed spy plane and satellite photos of an area in the small farming village of Nova Kasaba, about 14 miles west of Srebrenica. ""Before"" photos showed prisoners crowded into a soccer field and undisturbed earth in an empty field a half mile away. ""After"" photos from a few days later show no prisoners and three areas of disturbed earth in outlaying fields that resemble mass graves.

In addition, US officials cited the account of an elderly Muslim refugee, who said that he had been one of 600 men held at the Nova Kasaba soccer field. Bosnian Serb soldiers trucked the Muslim men in groups of 20 to a nearby field and machine gunned them, said the refugee, who escaped when he was left for dead among the corpses. The bodies of hundreds of men were then bulldozed into mass graves, according to the refugee's account.

During a reporter's visit to the site this Wednesday, three areas of fresh digging were clearly visible. On the edge of the smallest of the three alleged mass graves, what appeared to be a human femur and tibia surrounded by bits of tattered fabric jutted from rich brown dirt.

One hundred yards from the second-largest grave, handwritten notes from a March 14, 1995, local government meeting in the village of Potocari, located inside the former UN ""safe area"" of Srebrenica, were found. Twenty feet from the same grave, a 1982 elementary school diploma and what appeared to be washed-out personal photographs of a Muslim youth from the village of Kravice, also near Srebrenica, were found.

Approximately a quarter mile from the three sites, Muslim prayer beads, clothing, and still legible receipts and election ballots from Srebrenica were found.

Two empty ammunition boxes, each of which appeared to hold several hundred rounds, were seen near the three sites. A handful of shell casings was found across the street from one of the sites, but few shell casings were found on the graves themselves. Truck and bulldozer tracks leading to the alleged graves were visible.

The largest alleged grave measured roughly 300 feet by 300 feet, the second 250 feet by 200 feet, and the smallest 100 by 50 feet. And about a half mile from the sites, two large piles of fresh earth had been dumped near a small stream.

No guards were posted in the area, which consists of homes that were destroyed when the village was captured by the Bosnian Serbs in 1992. One group of soldiers questioned why a car was parked in the area, but moved on.

A second charge of Bosnian Serb atrocities involves the village of Bratunac, 10 miles northwest of the Srebrenica area.

In the first few days after the fall of Srebrenica, residents on the Serb side of the Drina River reported hearing gunfire coming from Bratunac.

According to published accounts, Serbs who crossed into Bratunac during the period were told that Muslims were being executed in the local soccer stadium.

During a visit to the site on Saturday, evidence that prisoners were held, tortured, and possibly killed was found in an abandoned building on the stadium grounds.

Dozens of piles of feces line the floor of the three-room, one-story building, and in two places it appeared that someone or something had been repeatedly rubbed through the waste. Several dozen bullet holes pocked the interior walls, and what appeared to be dried blood stains dotted the floor and one wall.

In an interview with a Serbian magazine at the time, Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic said captured men from Srebrenica were being taken to Bratunac for screening as potential war criminals. Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey alleged last month that 1,600 prisoners were killed in the stadium.

What occurred in the building is unclear, but the squalid conditions found there fit what captured Muslims from Srebrenica described in published accounts. Several Muslim prisoners have reported being crammed shoulder-to-shoulder into small rooms and being unable to move or go to the bathroom. Others reported torture, including being rubbed in feces.

An attempt to enter Srebrenica itself from Bratunac was blocked by Bosnian Serb police who said special permission from the party of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was needed.

Bratunac residents interviewed Saturday said they had seen no traces of Muslim refugees or prisoners in the town since the fall of Srebrenica. No prisoners were held in the soccer stadium either.

After interviewing dozens of Bosnian Serb civilians and soldiers over a 300-mile swath of Serb-held territory in Bosnia, the fate of 4,000 to 6,000 men that UN officials say are still missing from the enclaves remains unclear.

Of the 10,000 men believed to be in Srebrenica before its fall, roughly 6,000 are believed to have made it to government lines, leaving 4,000 unaccounted for.

Over 3,000 people, including 1,500 armed men, refused to surrender to the Bosnian Serbs after the July 18 fall of Zepa. Six hundred have crossed into neighboring Serbia, leaving 2,400 people unaccounted for.

Statements by Bosnian Serbs, and limited inspections of Bosnian Serb prisons by the International Red Cross last month, indicate that the 4,000 to 6,000 missing Muslims are not in Bosnian Serb custody. Dozens of soldiers and civilians interviewed gave accurate descriptions of the 30-mile flight of 6,000 Bosnian government soldiers from Srebrenica to government-held Tuzla last month.

But no civilians or soldiers interviewed between the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in Pale in eastern Bosnia to the city of Banja Luka in western Bosnia said they had even heard rumors of new Muslim prisoners.

Bosnian Serbs vehemently denied that any massacres had occurred and said that once men from Srebrenica were screened for potential war criminals, they were allowed to rejoin their families in government-held territory.

Contradicting this assertion, one Bosnian Serb soldier from the Srebrenica area said over 500 Muslim soldiers were shot by Serb forces after the fall of Srebrenica. He said at least 4,000 Bosnian government soldiers had been captured, and he believed they were imprisoned somewhere near the town of Bijeljina.

But civilians and soldiers in the Bijeljina area said no Muslim prisoners were there except for a few being held in nearby Batkovic. Limited inspections by the ICRC last month of the Batkovic detention center and other prisons in eastern Bosnia resulted in the discovery of only 164 prisoners from Srebrenica and 44 from Zepa.

One possibility is that more Muslims are alive in the hills of eastern Bosnia than believed. Serb soldiers and civilians, a Yugoslav Army soldier, and residents of scattered villages painted menacing pictures of hundreds of armed Muslims still roving the woods around the former safe areas.

Limited fighting, including one brief gunfire exchange in Nova Kasaba Wednesday, were witnessed. Two patrols of a half-dozen men were being conducted outside the town. A larger encampment of about 50 soldiers was observed near Nova Kasaba."
12,Christian Science Monitory,Rohde,1996,Bosnia Muslim Massacre,"Bosnian Serb soldiers systematically executed as many as 2,000 Muslim prisoners after taking the UN ''safe area'' of Srebrenica in July, according to credible eyewitness accounts newly obtained by The Christian Science Monitor.

Nine Muslim men who say they are survivors of mass executions gave separate, corroborating accounts of what could be one of the greatest single war crimes of Bosnia's brutal 3-1/2 year conflict. Executing prisoners is a war crime according to the Geneva Convention.

In interviews that were conducted without the supervision of the Bosnian government, the nine men gave compelling accounts of mass executions in five locations.

A pattern of hundreds of Muslim soldiers and male civilians being taken to the Serb-held villages of Nova Kasaba, Kravica, and Bratunac - near Srebrenica - on July 13 emerged from the accounts. Last month, the Monitor uncovered evidence that a mass grave containing hundreds of bodies exists in Nova Kasaba.

The largest execution appears to have occurred near Karakaj. Up to 2,000 prisoners were taken from the three villages to a remote location near the Serb-held town, 25 miles northwest of Srebrenica, and executed on July 14, according to the survivors.

Srebrenica, a refugee-packed mining town nestled in the thick forests and rolling hills of eastern Bosnia, fell to the Bosnian Serbs on July 11.

The conquest of the town and subsequent Bosnian Serb ''ethnic cleansing'' of its 40,000 Muslim residents sparked events that led to a more muscular Clinton administration policy in Bosnia, which soon may bring peace.

Bosnian Serb officials have repeatedly denied that any atrocities were committed by their forces following the fall of Srebrenica, but mounting evidence of widespread executions is again turning Srebrenica into a test of President Clinton's resolve.

Guaranteeing that the Bosnian Serbs allow access to the sites of the reported executions and that indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals - including Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic - are prosecuted could fall victim to the administration's desire to establish any peace in Bosnia before the 1996 election campaign enters full swing.

The nine survivors, four of whom have never been interviewed by a journalist before, paint a chilling picture of a far vaster killing field around Srebrenica than previously imagined:

Along with the execution of as many as 2,000 prisoners in Karakaj, hundreds of prisoners were executed in a warehouse in the village of Kravica, according to a survivor. At least three other executions involving 15 to 30 men occurred near the villages of Kuslat, Zabrde, and Rasica Gai, according to other survivors.
Between 300 and 400 elderly and infirm men who were either ordered by Dutch peacekeepers to leave the UN compound at Potocari or prevented from entering it were seized by Bosnian Serb soldiers and later executed in Karakaj on July 14, according to a Karakaj survivor. Surem Huljic, a man who says he was seized with other men in Potocari but survived the massacre by playing dead, believes all the men seized in Potocari were killed.
Another Karakaj survivor, Smail Hodjic, said he was told by several prisoners before the executions began in Karakaj that they had been taken captive by the Bosnian Serbs in Potocari.
Two massacre survivors reported seeing Bosnian Serb soldiers driving a UN armored personnel carrier after the fall of Srebrenica. Mevludin Oric, a Karakaj survivor, said a UN APC driven by men in UN uniforms who spoke fluent Serbo-Croatian escorted six buses of Muslim prisoners from the town of Bratunac to Karakaj on the morning of July 14. Oric believes the men were Serbs masquerading as UN soldiers to make prisoners believe that they were headed for a prisoner exchange in Karakaj, not a mass execution.
Eight of the survivors reported either being robbed, beaten, and tortured themselves or seeing other prisoners beaten or tortured by Bosnian Serb soldiers. More than 50 Muslims, most of whom were prominent political or business figures before the war, were singled out for torture and execution by Bosnian Serb soldiers and civilians on the night of July 13 when thousands of prisoners were held in the towns of Bratunac and Kravica, according to four survivors.
General Mladic, who US officials are currently negotiating with, spoke to prisoners or was seen at five sites - Potocari, Bratunac, Nova Kasaba, Kravica, and Karakaj - hours before executions were carried out, according to five survivors. Two Karakaj survivors say they saw Mladic riding in a car on the way to the execution site and getting out of a car at the Karakaj site as the killings occurred.
In separate interviews, the survivors described a similar sequence of events involving Mladic. According to the accounts, the general introduced himself or was introduced by his troops to prisoners. Mladic first mocked Bosnian government leaders and then promised the prisoners they would not be harmed and would be exchanged for Bosnian Serb prisoners.

Assuming all the accounts are true, the scope of the atrocities, and the logistics needed to carry out the executions, indicates that the decision to execute prisoners was made at the highest levels of the Bosnian Serb leadership. Bosnian Serb commander Mladic and self-styled Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic were indicted by The Hague-based International War Crimes Tribunal in July for atrocities committed earlier in the war.

Officials from the International War Crimes Tribunal would not comment on their ongoing investigation, but seven of the nine alleged survivors said they had been interviewed by tribunal investigators. All, including the five who say they saw Mladic, said their Bosnian Serb guards and executioners made no attempt to hide their identities. All of them also said they are willing to testify before the tribunal.

A senior UN official familiar with the ongoing investigation by the tribunal said a large amount of evidence indicating Mladic's involvement had been amassed by the tribunal. The official called the figure of nine credible survivors and as many as 2,000 executed accurate.

To test the credibility of the accounts, the men were not told during the interviews that the Monitor recently visited many of the sites they were describing.

In seamless narratives, the survivors gave detailed descriptions of locations visited by the Monitor in mid-August - such as a temporary Bosnian Serb troop encampment on a soccer field near the village of Nova Kasaba - while describing the mass executions.

All of the men publicly stated the names of dozens of friends and neighbors they said were killed in the mass executions. The survivors said they were willing to publicly name the victims - at the risk of inflicting grief on dozens of families - because they know they are right.

None of the men the survivors say died in the executions has been accounted for by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has recorded names of men imprisoned by Bosnian Serbs and taken to Serb territory.

The survivors and more than 100 Srebrenica men who made it to government-held territory were interviewed over a two-week period in and around the government-held city of Tuzla in northern Bosnia last month.

The accounts of two additional men who claimed to have survived mass executions were deemed not credible by the Monitor and dismissed.

According to dozens of men who made it to government-held territory, a column of more than 10,000 men - approximately half of whom were armed - left Srebrenica on the evening of July 11 and headed west.

The group, many of whom were civilians, hoped to sneak through 60 miles of Bosnian Serb-held hills, forests, and farmland to arrive in government-held central Bosnia.

A Serb ambush on July 12 near Kamenica killed several hundred and split the column roughly in half, the men said. Chaos ensued, with small groups of men wandering the forests, caught in a box between wide asphalt roads to the north and west patrolled by Bosnian Serbs in armored personnel carriers and Serb troops occupying the Srebrenica area to the east and south.

To make it to government-held territory, the men from Srebrenica had to cross the asphalt road to the west, which runs between the Bosnian-Serb held villages of Konjevic Polje and Milici. Many of them never did.

Approximately 4,000 men, the first section of the column, began crossing into government-held territory near Kladanj on July 16. An estimated 1,500 others have arrived in government-held territory in August and September, and as many as 800 Muslim men - including some from the fallen UN safe area of Zepa - have crossed into Serbia, according to Bosnian government and Red Cross officials.

But with only a few hundred men believed to be still hiding in the woods and the Serbs blocking access to the area, the whereabouts of the remaining 3,700 is unknown, UN officials say.

Revenge as motive
The Bosnian Serbs actions appear to have been motivated in part by revenge. In 1992, Muslim forces under the command of Nasir Oric systematically burned Serb villages and killed civilians in raids around Srebrenica. During the Monitor's tour of the area in August, Bosnian Serb soldiers expressed contempt for Srebrenica Muslims and accused them of attacking civilians.

In schools around government-held Tuzla that have been turned into refugee centers, few men can be seen. Women plead for information regarding missing husbands, sons, and fathers.

The family of one of the Muslim survivors, who asked to be called the common Muslim name of ''Haris'' because he feared retribution against missing relatives, illustrated how many men are missing. Haris's only brother, his brother-in-law, three of his uncles, and three of his cousins are missing. In his wife's family, her only brother and 23 other relatives are missing."
13,Christian Science Monitory,Rohde,1996,Bosnia Muslim Massacre,"A field just outside the Bosnian Serb-held farming village of Nova Kasaba is a mass grave holding the bodies of hundreds of Muslim men from the fallen United Nations ''safe area'' of Srebrenica, according to eyewitness accounts newly obtained by The Christian Science Monitor.

The new evidence - combined with a decomposed human leg and documents from Srebrenica found at the site by the Monitor on Aug. 16 - confirms Clinton administration allegations that Muslim prisoners were gathered on a nearby soccer field, addressed by Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, and executed on July 14 or 15.

Senior UN officials close to The Hague-based International War Crimes Tribunal say indictments for war crimes following the fall of Srebrenica, possibly involving General Mladic, could be issued within weeks. The officials also confirmed that the findings of a Monitor investigation, which concluded that more than 2,000 Muslim prisoners were executed and at least four mass graves exist around Srebrenica, are accurate.

Along with the mass grave in Nova Kasaba, three other mass graves exist around Srebrenica, according to Muslim men who arrived recently in government-held territory. In their first interview with a journalist, six men gave detailed descriptions of a grave near the village of Cerska, one man described a grave near Burnice, and three others a grave site at Karakaj.

The senior UN officials say an overwhelming amount of physical evidence of what could be the single largest war crime in Europe since World War II lies along a 20-mile network of roads in eastern Bosnia. But with the Bosnian Serbs saying the graves are filled with Muslims who died in combat, exhuming the bodies to examine how the men died is crucial.

Zagreb-based UN officials are concerned that if more leverage is not brought to bear on the Bosnian Serbs by the Clinton administration, the execution of thousands of Muslims could go unpunished. In the two months since US Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright made a dramatic and unusual presentation of classified US spy-satellite photos to the UN Security Council and accused Mladic of ''extraordinary cruelty,'' US officials have not publicly raised the issue.

UN officials in Zagreb warn that the Clinton administration is following a policy based more on political expediency than pursuing justice.

And the senior UN officials close to the Tribunal say that two months after Ms. Albright's presentation, the US government still has not turned over all of the photos it has of the Srebrenica area.

In August, senior US officials said they had more satellite photos that showed other graves, which along with the Nova Kasaba site could hold between 2,000 and 2,700 bodies.

US Interest Has Waned
UN officials have long accused the Clinton administration of releasing the Nova Kasaba photos to deflect criticism from its tacit approval of the Croatian Army's forced removal of 150,000 Serbs from the formerly Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia in early August. The issue of Srebrenica has been dropped, they say, because it no longer fits the administration's agenda.

The issue of war crimes is a crucial one for the Bosnian government and could scuttle the US-brokered peace talks. The Muslim-led Bosnian government is demanding that accused war criminals be turned over to the Tribunal, and access to what the human rights group Amnesty International says are 143 mass graves in Serb territory, be part of any peace agreement.

But without US backing, the demand is unlikely to be met. UN officials predict that the Clinton administration will try to ignore the issue as it hammers out a de facto partition of the country.

Mladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic have both been indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, a man who critics say should also be indicted as a war criminal and has the power to turn over Mladic and Karadzic, is refusing to cooperate with the Tribunal.

The Bosnian Serbs deny that any mass executions occurred following the fall of Srebrenica, and human rights groups, and investigators from the Tribunal have been denied access to the area.

The Nova Kasaba grave, which is large enough to hold 600 to 800 bodies, lies at the center of a killing zone created by Bosnian Serb forces as they hunted down more than 10,000 Muslim men from Srebrenica, only half of whom were armed, who tried to sneak through 60 miles of Serb territory to government-held central Bosnia.

The grave is located along a four-mile stretch of asphalt road between the villages of Nova Kasaba to Konjevic Polje that Muslims had to cross to make it to government-held territory. Thousands of them never did.

The Bosnian Serbs placed armored personnel carriers and patrols all along the picturesque road, which follows the meandering Jadar River and lies in a small valley. Muslims easily could be seen trying to cross farm fields and clearings around dozens of burned Muslim homes.

New evidence, obtained through interviews with nine men who say they survived mass executions and others who arrived from Srebrenica over the last three weeks, confirms that the site is a mass grave. The evidence includes:

Smail Hodjic, and another man taken to another location after Mladic spoke at the Nova Kasaba soccer field, say dozens of friends, relatives, and acquaintances from Srebrenica that they saw on the field on July 12 and 13 are now missing and presumed dead. The two men, who both survived a later mass execution near the town of Karakaj, say hundreds of men held at the soccer field were executed and buried in the nearby grave.
Both men who say they were at the soccer field gave correct, detailed descriptions of the soccer field, which was visited by the Monitor in August.
The men also accuretely described the way prisoners and their Bosnian Serb guards were configured on the field according to the US spy-satellite photo taken on July 12 or 13. But US analysts estimated that there were only 600 prisoners in the field, not the 1,000 to 1,500 the two men say.
In separate interviews, both described Mladic addressing the prisoners at around 3 p.m. Mladic derided Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, told the prisoners they would not be harmed, and said they would soon be returned to their families.
According to a report released by UN investigators on Aug. 22, a peacekeeper and a woman from Srebrenica transitting the Nova Kasaba area saw hundreds of prisoners in the soccer field.
On the following day, July 15, another UN peacekeeper reported seeing shoes and rucksacks of 100 men on the soccer field and a tractor pulling a cart with corpses on it. Closer to the grave site, he saw another row of shoes, 20 to 40 people, and a truck carrying corpses, as well as an excavator.

Another credible eyewitness, who was hiding in the woods in the area on July 14 and 15, reports seeing 40 Muslim prisoners being tortured and executed one mile north of the grave site. A truck was loaded with bodies and drove south toward the grave.

Two documents found at the grave site by the Monitor last month have been identified by relatives and friends as belonging to two men from Srebrenica who are missing and presumed dead.
Dervis Smajic, the brother of Murat Smajic, a man whose 1982 elementary school certificate of merit was found only 50 feet from one of the mass graves, gasped when he was shown the document. ''He was carrying it with him for identification,'' stammered Mr. Smajic, who stared blankly at the certificate then quietly faded into a crowd of soldiers. ''My father and I were separated from him in an ambush.''
Photographs washed out by rain with handwritten Muslim names written on the back were found at the grave site, next to the certificate. Smajic, before being told that photographs had been found, stated that his brother was carrying family photos.
The other document found at the grave site, a piece of paper with handwritten notes on it found 200 feet from one of the graves, was identified by soldiers from the Srebrenica enclave as belonging to Mehmed Vejzovic, a man who is also missing.
The paper contains handwritten notes from a March 14, 1995, community meeting in the village of Potocari inside the former Srebrenica ''safe area.'' In another section of the paper are notes on how to load and use various weapons. Vejzovic, the soldiers said, was involved in civil defense in Potocari.

Survivors of the execution also said a large number of prisoners were held overnight in the village of Bratunac on July 13. A small building on the grounds of the Bratunac soccer field filled with human feces, blood stains, bullet-pocked walls, and indications of torture discovered by the Monitor in August was only a few hundred yards from where prisoners were kept, according to the survivors. Small groups of men were taken away during the night, according to the survivors, and never returned.

Rejha Gabeljic, a Muslim woman who crossed into government-held territory on Sep. 10, said that she had been released, but that nine Muslim men are being held in a forced labor camp in Milici.

There was no way to confirm her report. Bosnian Serbs interviewed by the Monitor in the Srebrenica area in August denied that Muslim prisoners were being held."
14,Christian Science Monitory,Rohde,1996,Bosnia Muslim Massacre,"Muslim witnesses say that an officer from Serbia was directing the roundup of Muslim prisoners in the village of Konjevic Polje, and that a Serb officer captured by Muslim forces was following orders issued from the Serbian capital, Belgrade.

''[The Serb officer] said they were under orders from Belgrade not to allow any men to escape from Srebrenica,'' says Bosnian soldier Dzemal Malovic.

''All Muslim men were to be captured or killed,'' said Mr. Malovic, one of three Bosnian soldiers who say they spoke to and looked at identity papers of the captured Serbian captain.

In a separate interview, a Muslim officer confirmed that the Serbian officer had been captured. The Serbian officer's whereabouts are unknown, and he may have been killed later by Muslim forces.

Western diplomats have long suspected that the Bosnian Serb attack on Srebrenica in mid-July was approved by Belgrade, but the government of President Slobodan Milosevic has vehemently denied it.

Mr. Milosevic's involvement would be an embarrassment for the Clinton administration, eager to portray Milosevic - who will be attending peace talks in Ohio next week - as a peacemaker in the Balkans, not a war criminal.

''Whether by commission or omission, [Milosevic] is responsible, no question,'' says a senior UN military official based in Zagreb, Croatia. ''He had plenty of sources on the ground there. He had to know what was happening, and either approved of it or did nothing to stop it.''

A senior Western diplomat in Zagreb also says Milosevic is responsible for what is quickly emerging as one of the darkest hours of Bosnia's 3-1/2 year conflict.

''I have no doubt he directly approved or tacitly approved of the taking of Srebrenica,'' the diplomat says. ''Whether Milosevic knew [about the executions] or not, he knows what kind of man [Bosnian Serb Army commander Gen. Ratko] Mladic is and how he operates.''

Reports of Mass Executions
Over 2,000 Muslim men were executed by Bosnian Serb forces following the fall of Srebrenica, according to nine survivors interviewed by the Monitor last month.

War-crimes investigators now have evidence that as many as 3,000 to 4,000 men were executed by the Bosnian Serbs, according to a senior UN official close to the investigation. ''Wait until everything comes out,'' he says. ''Then, people will understand how big this is.''

The UN official close to the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague said mass graves ring the area around Srebrenica, and confirmed the existence of a new set of United States spy photos showing a new group of apparent mass graves near the village of Karakaj, as reported by the Boston Globe on Oct.3.

The photos confirm the accounts of five men interviewed by the Monitor who say over 2,000 Muslim prisoners were executed near the town of Karakaj on July 18. The photos may be the basis for new indictments against General Mladic expected to be issued by the Tribunal.

Bosnian Serb officials have said that mass graves in the village of Nova Kasaba captured in US spy photos and visited by the Monitor in August contain the bodies of Muslim soldiers who were killed in combat and not executed.

But the Karakaj site is too far from the route that Muslim men would have followed to escape from Srebrenica, according to the UN official.

Mevludin Oric, a survivor of the Karakaj execution, said in an interview that one of the officers directing the roundup of prisoners in Konjevic Polje was a 40- to 45-year-old officer from Serbia. Mr. Oric is considered by war-crimes investigators to be one of their most credible witnesses. The Serbian officer was not present at the later execution, Oric added.

Who gave the order to execute thousands of prisoners remains unknown.

But evidence of Milosevic's involvement in Srebrenica has been mounting for months, and it is not known if Mladic would execute such a large number of men without at least the tacit approval of Serbian leaders in Belgrade.

Mladic, who eyewitnesses interviewed by the Monitor said was at Karakaj and three other executions sites during or just before executions began, had been visiting Belgrade regularly for weeks prior to the attack.

Dutch peacekeepers reported seeing members of paramilitary groups from Serbia, and Muslims say they saw Belgrade-based paramilitary leader Zeljko ''Arkan'' Raznjatovic in Srebrenica.

The Washington Post reported seeing Muslim soldiers driving a jeep with Yugoslav Army license plates on July 17. The Muslims said they had captured the jeep from forces involved in the attack on Srebrenica.

New York Newsday reported on Aug. 12 that Western intelligence officials captured radio intercepts of Yugoslav Army chief Gen. Momcilo Perisic, directing Mladic on how to attack Srebrenica during the offensive.

Serb Denials
Yugoslav officials have strenuously denied the accounts, but the Yugoslav Army and Arkan are believed to be tightly controlled by Milosevic, who holds an iron grip over Serbia's military.

Despite the growing evidence, Srebrenica survivors remain skeptical that Milosevic - whom the Clinton administration is depending on to force the Bosnian Serbs to agree to a peace deal - will be tied to or punished for Europe's worst massacre since World War II.

''It all depends on the politicians,'' Malovic says. ''They could punish them, or reward them, for doing this.''"
15,Christian Science Monitory,Rohde,1996,Bosnia Muslim Massacre,"From 100 yards away, the freshly turned earth of the field appeared to be covered with haphazard dots. Five feet away, the dots became empty shoes, shattered eyeglasses, and decaying clothing.

In the woods nearby, three canes and a crutch jutted from a mildewing heap of more than 100 windbreakers, sweatshirts, and leather jackets. No evidence of battles having been fought was found.

The forlorn debris and areas of fresh digging, discovered by the Monitor on Oct. 29, are the most specific and convincing evidence yet that Bosnian Serb forces massacred thousands of Muslim civilians - including the elderly and crippled - after the fall of the UN ''safe area'' of Srebrenica.

Bosnian Serbs say no massacres occurred and the graves are filled with Muslim soldiers killed in combat. But the crutch that was found is something no combatant would lean on. The three wooden canes are supports no soldiers would need.

The Monitor has visited four of six possible mass grave sites identified by US spy planes and satellites around the fallen Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. At

each site, human remains, documents from Srebrenica, Muslim identity cards, personal photos with Muslim names on them, or civilian clothing have been found (List of grave sites, left).

Europe's worst massacre of civilians since World War II was apparently carried out with brutal efficiency on the nights of July 14, 15, and 16, as nine survivors interviewed by the Monitor in September say it did. Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, whom eyewitnesses place at this and three other execution sites, apparently ordered the cold-blooded executions of as many as 5,000 Muslim prisoners.

The United States has said it will not sign any peace agreement that would allow General Mladic or ''President'' Radovan Karadzic to remain in power, and insists they must be turned over to the war crimes tribunal. Mladic and Mr. Karadzic have reportedly agreed to leave office, but only if they receive immunity from prosecution.

The new evidence found at Sahanici could increase pressure on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who says he was unaware of the massacres, to oust his erstwhile allies, Mladic and Karadzic. The future of the two indicted war criminals is a key issue in US-led talks in Ohio aimed at a comprehensive peace in the Balkans.

The new evidence found in Sahanici also may give the US added leverage to force Mr. Milosevic to finally come through on long-running promises to grant war crimes investigators access to mass graves around Srebrenica. Since the peace talks began, Milosevic has twice promised to grant free access to the sites, but failed to deliver.

But time may be running out. US intelligence officials announced last week that the Bosnian Serbs have already tried to destroy evidence at one of the mass graves last month and could be tampering with others now.

The US has had the photographic evidence of six graves around Srebrenica since late July and US agents may have visited the sites to confirm that they are not the result of agriculture or construction work, according to intelligence officials. US officials estimate that six graves are large enough to hold up to 2,700 bodies.

The Bosnian Serb authorities have repeatedly refused to grant the UN, tribunal investigators, and journalists free access to the area around Srebrenica since the enclave fell. Using pinpoint locations obtained from US-based intelligence sources, the Monitor visited the Sahanici area for three hours on Oct. 29 without the permission of Bosnian Serb authorities.

This correspondent changed the date of issue on a Bosnian Serb press accreditation from 19/12/94 to 29/10/95 and used it to pass through Bosnian Serb checkpoints and reach the area. This correspondent was arrested at the execution site by Bosnian Serb police, stripped of all documents and photos taken of the area, accused of espionage, and jailed for 10 days.

Up to now, reports of the massacres have been primarily based on survivor accounts that could not be independently confirmed. But the evidence found in the Sahanici area corroborates the accounts of five Muslim men who say they survived the execution of as many as 2,000 men from Srebrenica.

The school, the railroad tracks, and the earthen dam that five survivors described were found in the area around Sahanici. Two mass graves found near a school are exactly where three of the survivors say they should be. Ten miles away at the Red Mud Dam, two human femurs were found on a gravel plateau that two survivors say was an execution site.

Bosnian Serb police and civilians vehemently deny that any massacres took place after the fall of Srebrenica and say they are willing to grant access to the area. Any mass graves that exist are filled with Muslim soldiers fleeing Srebrenica who were killed as they tried to fight their way to government-held central Bosnia. Any human remains, documents, or clothes found in the area are either from Muslims who fought their way through the area this summer, they claim, or from heavy fighting that occurred there when war broke out in 1992.

In a possible explanation for what may have motivated the massacres, Bosnian Serbs bitterly accused Srebrenica's Muslim military commander, Nasir Oric, of massacring some 1,300 Serb civilians in fighting in the area in 1992. UN officials say Mr. Oric, who played a videotape of murdered Serb civilians to Western reporters in 1994, did launch a handful of subsequent raids from the theoretically demilitarized UN ''safe area'' of Srebrenica.

But the clothes, documents, and digging at the two sites, which are 10 to 15 miles from the main escape route used by fleeing Muslims and appeared to be no more than a few months old, were overwhelming evidence that civilians were massacred:

Three canes, a crutch, and some 100 civilian jackets were found in a large pile 100 feet from the two mass graves, indicating that civilians, elderly, and the handicapped were among those executed.
An identity card from the Muslim safe area of Srebrenica, an identity card with a Muslim name on it, and personal photos with Muslim names - including one from a young girl who had written ''I love you, Meho'' on the back of a small portrait - were found in the jackets.
The smaller of the two graves near the Sahanici school reeked of rotting flesh.
Thirty to 40 shoes, a pair of pants, a shirt, a blue civilian beret, socks, and shattered eyeglasses still in their case were found scattered across the top of the graves.
The two graves near the Sahanici school are adjacent to railroad tracks and a paved road and are in two adjacent fields - details that match the descriptions of three men who say they survived a massacre there.
The layout of a school a half mile from the graves perfectly matches the descriptions of survivors who say that more than 1,000 Muslim prisoners, including elderly men taken from outside the main UN base in Srebrenica, were gathered before they were executed. Adding credibility to the survivors' accounts, Bosnian Serb police, who confiscated pictures the Monitor took of the school where massacre survivors say they saw Bosnian Serb commander Mladic, said the school is a military installation.
At the second site, evidence of another mass execution was found. Two human femurs were seen on a gravel plateau. A bucket loader had removed a half-dozen scoops of dirt from a nearby hill, possibly using it to bury bodies.

The layout of the dam, the existence of the gravel plateau where the bones were seen, and a nearby drainage ditch, exactly matches the description of two Muslims who say 500 to 1,000 Muslims were massacred there.

Four months after the fall of Srebrenica, the International Committee of the Red Cross says that 8,500 men from Srebrenica are still unaccounted for. At least 3,000 of those men were last seen in Bosnian Serb custody, according to eyewitnesses.

US officials estimate that as many as 6,000 Muslims were executed by the Serbs. War crimes investigators estimate that 4,000 to 6,000 Muslims were massacred.

Each of the six potential graves matches the description of a massacre survivor, a witness of an execution, or a witness of a mass burial interviewed by the Monitor.

A final, accurate accounting of the Srebrenica massacres will only come if Sahanici and the other five sites are dredged for the truth."
16,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"Before the pink light of dawn could touch the snowy peaks of the Hindu Kush mountains around this ruined capital, five young Afghans met on a bitterly cold morning last week for the gamble of a lifetime.

On borrowed bicycles, they planned to cross siege lines to the south of the city, load up with sacks of flour, cans of gasoline and bundles of firewood, and be back home by noon.

From the 300 percent price difference between the Kabul bazaars and the traders outside the city, they calculated that they would make enough money to pay the bicycle owners and keep their families from the hunger and cold of Kabul for a month.

A few hours later, one of the five, a former professional boxer named Hamid, was near death in the intensive care unit of a hospital about a mile behind the front lines. Villagers who found him said four of the five young men had been killed by machine-gun fire that met them as they rounded a corner in the no man's land separating Afghan Government troops from the besieging forces of the Taliban, a militant Islamic force that pushed to within a mile of Kabul's outskirts last fall.

In the dim room where Hamid lay semiconscious, the only sounds were the groans and wheezing of others fighting for their lives from wounds suffered in bombing raids, mine explosions, artillery barrages and forays across the front lines by people like Hamid. At least 20 traders were killed last week alone.

Occasionally, one of the wounded cried out weakly: ""Allah. Allah. Grant us mercy.""

This spring, it will be 18 years since Marxist conspirators overthrew the Afghan President and set off a civil war. Next week, it will be seven years since the withdrawal of the last of the Soviet troops who invaded the country in December 1979, ostensibly in support of those Marxist rulers, only to be bludgeoned in a nine-year conflict with American-backed Muslim guerrillas that devastated much of the country and gravely weakened the Soviet Union itself.

In April, it will be four years since the puppet Communist Government that the Russians left behind in Kabul finally collapsed, giving way to a new civil war between rival Muslim groups whose enmity for one another turned out to be as great as their hatred of the Soviet invaders.

Ruinous Times: Wars Bring Misery And Exile to Millions
The miseries heaped on this ancient land by the years of fighting are captured in the grim statistics kept by United Nations officials who try to lessen the unending suffering with their relief efforts.

In a country that had a population of 15.5 million in the last census before the Communist takeover, at least one million people have been killed, and two million have been displaced from their homes to other towns and cities inside Afghanistan. Six million others have been driven across the borders into Pakistan and Iran. Less than half of those refugees have returned since the end of Communist rule in 1992.

About two million others, international relief agencies estimate, have been permanently disabled, either physically or mentally.

On the crumbling sidewalks of Kabul, in the overcrowded hospital wards and at the brick-oven bakeries that face clamoring crowds at first light each day, there is an angry consensus that no time since the Communist coup in April 1978 has been as bitter as now.

So dispirited is the mood that it is common to hear people say what would have been unthinkable in the years when the Soviet occupation was a synonym for brutality: that the ""Russian time,"" as it is known, was not so bad after all, at least in Kabul.

""Ah, the Russian time -- that was golden, compared with this,"" said a doctor at the Karte Seh Hospital, watching stretcher bearers carrying in the body of a 14-year-old boy whose brain had been blown out of his skull by a Taliban bombing raid.

Partly, the gloom is a product of the winter, one of the harshest in memory, with temperatures that sink to near zero at night, chilling mud-walled homes that still stand amid the rubble that is all that remains of at least half of Kabul. Scores of people go to hospitals each morning with frostbite.

Partly, it is the scarcity of food, made worse than ever this winter by a tightening of the siege by the Muslim guerrilla groups that control the roads leading to Kabul from Mazar-i-Sharif in the north, Jalalabad in the east and Kandahar in the south.

These roads, lifelines that have never before been completely shut off for more than a few days, have been closed for much of the last month, creating a crisis as stocks of flour and cooking oil and other staples in United Nations warehouses dwindle.

On Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross began an emergency airlift from Peshawar in Pakistan, a 70-minute flight across the mountains to the east. With several shuttles a day, the Swiss-based relief agency plans to bring in more than 1,000 metric tons of wheat to Bagram, a former Soviet air base in a remote area 20 miles northeast of Kabul that is still under Government control.

The airlift planners hope to show the besieging guerrillas that they cannot starve out the city. But more than the privations of cold and hunger and gunfire, it is a sense of hopelessness that seems to gnaw at the 1.2 million people of this city.

""Afghanistan is no more,"" said Aysha, the mother-in-law of Hamid, the bicycle trader who took a bullet in the chest. ""We have been abandoned by the world.""

Aysha, who like many Afghans uses only one name, sobbed as she clutched the young man's hand. ""The people who did this are no Muslims,"" she said. ""They are the henchmen of Satan, and they will surely suffer in hell."" Doctors said they did not expect Hamid to survive.

Islam's Liberators Pledge of Peace Soon Vanishes
A year ago, when the Taliban forces first pushed to the gates of Kabul, many in the city saw them as potential liberators, despite stories of their intolerance in the first city they captured, Kandahar, where the movement was formed and has its headquarters.

There, women were denied the right to work, ordered to wear full veils over their faces and punished if caught outside their homes with men other than their fathers or brothers.

Word of these strictures appeared to have less of an impact on the people of Kabul than the Taliban's success in overwhelming several of the contending guerrilla groups left over from the Soviet occupation.

But the Taliban's promise that it would end the war and the battering of the civilian population, then step aside for a popularly elected government, evaporated quickly.

Soon, the militants were following the example of the guerrilla groups they supplanted, pounding Kabul with heavy artillery. In May, throngs in the capital celebrated when the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the military commander who is the power behind the Government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, struck the Taliban combatants with a lightning offensive and drove them back 30 miles from the capital.

But in September, the Taliban was back. After capturing the western city of Herat from Ismail Khan, an ally of Mr. Massoud, the militants drove back up the road to Kabul and threatened to overrun the city before Mr. Massoud's defenses stiffened.

Since then, the daily artillery barrages have resumed, along with bombing attacks by the Taliban's embryonic air force. Thousands more have died, bringing the civilian toll in the capital since the Communist collapse in 1992 to at least 25,000, officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross say.

Government estimates put the death toll far higher, at least 45,000. But even at the lower figure, Kabul has suffered more in terms of sheer destruction and in the number killed than Sarajevo, where 10,000 to 15,000 people are said to have died during the 40 months of Serbian bombardments that ended last fall.

And because there is only a vestigial international presence here -- no United Nations military force of the kind that attempted to mitigate the conflict in Bosnia, and only skeleton staffs at the United Nations and other international relief agencies that distribute food, medical supplies and other aid -- the civilian population's distress seems more acute.

Last week, quieter than many since the fall, there were at least three attacks on bicyclists crossing the front lines in search of food, fuel and firewood, and a Taliban bombing attack in which two jets dropped four 1,000-pound bombs.

Two of the bombs exploded in a district of southern Kabul that was reduced to acres of rubble in bombardments that leveled much of the city from 1992 to 1995. Because much of the population still lives amid the rubble, the bombs fell in a busy street, killing at least 20 people and wounding many more. Hospital emergency rooms were awash with blood.

Government officials place blame for the carnage on Pakistan, which has backed the Taliban, apparently to win favor with two powerful Pakistani groups -- Islamic militants, and Pakistan's own population of ethnic Pathans, who are indistinguishable from the Afghan Pathans who predominate in the Taliban force.

Pakistan's role has angered Iran, Russia and India, which have given concerted support in recent months to the Rabbani Government even though it is led and dominated by members of the ethnic Tajik minority that has held power in Afghanistan only once before in the last 250 years.

Each night, planes carrying arms, ammunition, spare parts and other suppplies paid for by Teheran, Moscow and Delhi land at the Bagram air base, leaving telltale vapor trails in the starry skies over Kabul.

Almost as much opprobrium is directed at the United States, which poured more than $5 billion of money and arms into the Muslim guerrilla struggle against the Soviet forces, then virtually disappeared as a factor in Afghan affairs after the cold war ended.

A relief effort by the United States Agency for International Development ended in 1994, and American aid channeled through the United Nations and other relief groups has fallen to between $40 million and $60 million a year, the United States Embassy in Pakistan estimates. American diplomacy has been limited to encouraging a United Nations mediation effort that has never come close to persuading the contending Muslim groups to end the fighting.

Many in Kabul share the view of President Rabbani's Foreign Minister, Najibullah Lafraie, who said in an interview that the United States had a moral responsibility to re-engage in Afghanistan's affairs because of its role in the struggle against the Soviet occupation.

""We believed we were fighting for the freedom of the whole world, not just for the freedom of Afghanistan,"" said Mr. Lafraie, who was awarded a doctorate by the University of Hawaii in the 1980's. ""We fought against the country that Ronald Reagan called the evil empire, and it was as a result of our sacrifices that the evil empire collapsed. But afterward we were forgotten.""

Pointless Combat: A Society Beyond Despair
But political arguments seem lost on the poorest people of Kabul, who move through their days with an air of hopelessness that seems to be beyond despair.

Stories abound of mothers abandoning their children in mosques because they lack food. Foreigners are approached at every stop by women beggars wearing the full-face netted shrouds that are traditional among conservative Afghans. Packs of stray dogs howl in the streets at night as they move between street-corner garbage dumps.

To many people, the distinctions between the rival Muslim groups long ago lost significance, and the Rabbani Government has become virtually indistinguishable from its Communist predecessor.

Officials like Mr. Lafraie sit in the same offices, served by some of the same obsequious aides, and ride in the same curtained Mercedes-Benz sedans. Like the Communist Government, the Rabbani administration leaves most relief efforts to international organizations. When the Afghan currency loses half of its value in a matter of days, as it did when the roads were blocked in January, it is the ordinary people, not senior Government officials, who go hungry.

On the front lines, the war seems to have attained a purposeless momentum of its own. Young men, some in their mid-teens, take the winter sunshine on battered steel chairs, adorned in a bizarre mixture of American and Soviet camouflage fatigues, as if to emphasize the irrelevance of the political disinctions that once fueled the fighting.

For them, life has been reduced to rounds of banditry, exacting tolls from those who return with their modest bounty from Taliban-held territory on bicycles and horsecarts. Sometimes the day's round turns to seemingly mindless violence.

When two 10-year-old scavengers traipsed past one roadblock near the front lines carrying sacks filled with farming implements, one young soldier overheard one of the boys saying he did not understand what the war was about, and saw nothing to choose from between the Rabbani Government and the Taliban.

The soldier took the boy by the ear, twisted it and extracted a vow of loyalty to Mr. Massoud. Then he adjusted his Soviet tank crewman's helmet and smiled.

""This war will never end,"" he said."
17,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"When the crowds were summoned to the main stadium in Herat earlier this month, they went as Romans did to the Coliseum, to watch the grim ritual of death.

First, the crowd sat through a harangue by a Muslim cleric from the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist force that emerged from the chaos of civil war in Afghanistan to take control of more than half the country in the last 18 months.

Then Taliban officials turned their attention to an Afghan man who was said to have been convicted by a Taliban court of a triple murder. After his hands and feet were tied, and a noose put around his neck, he was hoisted slowly by a crane.

Afghans who saw the execution said the man died slowly, jerking spasmodically before finally going limp.

From the crowd, there were shouts of ""Allah be praised!"" Outside the stadium, slumped against a wall and wailing, were several women, relatives of the condemned man, covered head to foot in the manner the Taliban prescribes.

The new Afghanistan is a world where murderers and ""enemies"" of the Taliban are hanged from cranes and the barrels of tank cannon, where the execution of others found guilty of killing consists of being shot in the back with rifles by their victims' fathers, and where convicted thieves are subjected to surgical amputations of their hands and arms.

After the anarchy of recent years, many Afghans have welcomed the harsh punishments meted out by the Taliban to some violent criminals.

According to reports published recently in Pakistan, there was an execution carried out in the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost a few days ago.

A large crowd that had gathered on the grounds of a local hotel cheered when a retired Pakistani soldier named Faizullah Khattak fired a burst from a Kalashnikov rifle into the back of an Afghan named Mohammed Ullah who was convicted by an Islamic court of killing Khattak's son, a taxi driver who had crossed into Afghanistan with a passenger last year.

In another execution, the condemned man, an Afghan in his early 20s, was said to have begged forgiveness for killing his cousin, only to be cut down by two bursts of automatic rifle fire by his uncle.

Not since 1979, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led an Islamic revolution in Iran, which borders on Afghanistan only 75 miles west of here, has this region been wrenched so abruptly toward the past. Nor, since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the same year, has there been anything to match the Taliban's potential threat of completing a 2,000-mile chain of animosity toward the West -- through Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.

The other macabre twist is that in Afghanistan this hostile force is a mutation of American cold war politics. For the Taliban emerged from the chaos of a war between American proxy warriors and Soviet troops, and is still supported by the arms network of American allies created to challenge Soviet power.

Only a year ago, the rise of the Taliban was greeted with widespread enthusiasm in areas of the country that they now control. Their sudden emergence as a political and military force, from a base in the southern city of Kandahar, was propelled by their pledge to ""cleanse"" Afghanistan of the killing, rape and pillage that became endemic under the cover of the civil war that ensued after Soviet troops were withdrawn in 1989.

But instead of the relief they promised, the Taliban have plunged millions of Afghans into a new chapter of brutality that echoes the harshness of Afghanistan's distant past.

It is a world where there has been a systematic drive to push women back into purdah, the traditional Muslim arrangement that prevents them from seeing any men outside their immediate families. In Herat, like other places the Taliban rule, this practice has meant a loss of rights most Afghan women had enjoyed for decades.

Under Taliban decrees, women have been forbidden to work outside their homes, except in hospitals and clinics, and then only if they work exclusively with women and girls. Girls have been expelled from schools and colleges, and told that, for now at least, education is for boys only. Girls who were only months from finishing high school, or young women graduating from college, have been told their career dreams are over.

Women wishing to go shopping in the bazaars, or to move anywhere outside their homes, must be accompanied by male kinfolk and wear the traditional burqa, a head-to-toe shroud with a netted slot over the eyes.

The regime imposed by the Taliban, across a 600-mile stretch of territory from Herat in the west to the Pakistan border in the east, is one of such hostility to ""modern"" influences that the secretive Muslim clerics who lead the movement have ordered public ""hangings"" of television sets, video-cassette players and stereo systems. In Herat, Taliban fighters have gone from house to house pulling down satellite dishes and antennas, and confiscating books judged to be tainted by Western influence.

As in the Iran of the ayatollahs, the Taliban's rule joins a harsh interpretation of the Muslim holy book, the Koran, with modern forms of enforcement. Herat bristles with Taliban ""warriors"" in long-tailed turbans carrying Kalashnikov rifles. Some watch suspiciously from rooftops, while others thunder through the narrow, crowded streets of the bazaars in Japanese pickup trucks that were bought for them by sympathetic Arab countries, Saudi Arabia among them.

Along with their puritanical beliefs, the Taliban, since winning control of Herat in September, have loosed a wave of banditry. In the privacy of their mud-walled courtyards, Herat's frightened townsfolk tell of Taliban men bursting in at night, stealing money and gold and cars, and press-ganging men, some as young as 15, for service in Taliban ranks. So far, the townsfolk say, there has been no known case of the Taliban punishing any intruder.

""For 18 years, we lived in hope that things would get better,"" said an elderly Afghan scholar, one of a minority of professional people who did not flee Herat in the exodus that followed the Soviet invasion.

In a home redolent of a richer past -- a glassed-in orangery looking onto a garden flanked by apricot trees -- the scholar added: ""We are ruled now by men who offer us nothing but the Koran, even though many of them cannot read; who call themselves Muslims, and know nothing of the true greatness of our faith. There are no words for such people. We are in despair.""

For some Afghans, the Taliban represent the end-product of a war that has worn away what little progress this intensely conservative country made before a Communist coup in 1978 led to the Soviet invasion, a decade of guerrilla conflict, and now, seven years after the Soviet forces left, a seemingly endless civil war. With its cities, towns and villages in rubble, and little left to destroy, these Afghans say, the country has finally reached, in the ascendancy of the Taliban, something close to a primal state.

Apart from their social and religious rigors, the Taliban, who mainly belong to the ethnic Pashtun group that accounts for nearly half the population of Afghanistan, are obtrusive outsiders in Herat. By their customs and by their language, Pashto, as well as by their appearance, they are set apart from the majority in Herat, where the population of 200,000 is mostly drawn from the ethnic Tajik minority, with its own language, Dari, which is a dialect of Persian.

The differences are deeply resented in Herat, a city that was once a major center for the arts and learning, with close ties to the Persian dynasties that were a fountainhead of culture and military skill. In the disdain many people in Herat show for the Taliban there is an element of the superiority people here have always felt towards those outside the Persian cultural tradition, particularly Pashto-speakers from Kandahar. In the bazaars of Herat, Taliban are frequently referred to as ""donkey boys,"" a term commonly used to describe people who are considered crude and uncivilized.

But long before the Taliban seized control here, ethnic and linguistic strains had been sharpened by the war. For 250 years, since Afghanistan came together as a nation, Afghans have had a fierce sense of national pride that has overridden regional attachments. But since the war against the Soviet forces began in 1979, empowering local warlords who made strongholds of every plain and valley, the country has disintegrated into a mosaic of ethnic fiefs.

An Uzbek group, led by Abdul-Rashid Doestam a former leader of a Communist militia, controls much of the north around Mazar-i-Sharif. A predominantly Tajik group led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, a former Muslim guerrilla leader, controls the northeast and the capital, Kabul. A group of ethnic Hazaras, Shiite Muslims with strong links to Iran, dominate in the mountains northwest of Kabul. Ethnic Pashtun groups prevail almost everywhere else.

Of the Pashtun groups, the most powerful is the Taliban. Virtually unknown until September 1994, they gained power first in Kandahar, historically a center of Islamic conservatism. The name Taliban was taken from the Arabic word for students, a reference to the fact that the core group of Taliban came together at Muslim religious schools known as madrassahs in Kandahar and, before that, during the Soviet occupation, at similar institutions across the border in Pakistan.

Reinforced by defectors from the Communist government's armed forces, and backed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan -- American allies -- the Taliban thrived on popular disillusionment with the war. After Kandahar, they drove rapidly east and west, meeting little resistance. Mostly, rival armed groups either handed over their weapons, or joined the Taliban. Within six months of taking Kandahar, the Taliban were at the gates of Kabul. Within a year, they had taken Herat.

The drive on Kabul went into reverse when it met with a stiff rebuff from Massoud. But since September, Taliban forces have once again threatened the capital, maintaining a tight siege in a loose alliance with Doestam, whose forces are pressing on Kabul from the north. To the east of the capital a Muslim guerrilla group led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a Pashtun leader who was a favored recipient of American money and arms during the war against the Russians, has recovered from his own defeat by the Taliban a year ago to participate in the siege.

Massoud has predicted a major Taliban offensive, probably about Feb. 20, after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends, and has implied that he is planning his own pre-emptive strike against the fundamentalists. Many in Afghanistan say that the outcome of the next round of fighting between the two groups could be the decisive event in the civil war.

If the Taliban take the capital -- unlikely, but not impossible, in the view of Western diplomats in Islamabad -- the prospect would be for a Taliban government much like the administrations they have installed in 12 of Afghanistan's 31 provinces. In Kandahar, Herat and other places they have taken power, the Taliban rule through a shura, or council, composed of Muslim clerics known as mullahs. Decisions are reached in secret, and announced as decrees. Resistance is punishable by death.

For the moment, Taliban leaders in Herat appear keen to accentuate their reasonableness, at least to outsiders. A Western reporter who spent five days here, and an accompanying photographer, moved freely about the city and took photographs at will, something said to be almost impossible for foreigners in Kandahar. ""We see no country in the world as our enemy, even if they want to consider us as their enemies,"" said Noor Mohammed Akhund, a 32-year-old mullah who is the third-ranking Taliban leader in Herat.

One reason for the less stringent attitude toward Westerners in Herat could be the growing hostility toward the Taliban in Iran, which has joined India and Russia in an airlift of arms, ammunition and other supplies to the Massoud forces in Kabul. The Taliban's brand of militant Islam, despite its superficial similarities with Iran, has done nothing to alleviate estrangements that grow from the 1,300-year-old schism in the Muslim world between Shiites, the majority in Iran, and Sunnis, who make up the overwhelming majority of the Afghan population.

But politics, more than religion, appear to underpin the Taliban's distrust of Iran. From the outset, the Taliban have been strongly backed by Pakistan, a fact that has prompted Iranian religious leaders to denounce the Taliban as part of an American plot to encircle Iran. Recent military preparations by the Taliban suggest that Taliban leaders fear an attempt by the Kabul government, with Iran's backing, to try to recapture Herat.

The Massoud ally who ruled here until September, Ismail Khan, who fled to the eastern Iranian city of Meshed with thousands of supporters, is said to have regained control of several strategic towns south and west of Herat, perhaps in preparation for a possible strike against Herat.

That the Taliban have reason to fear challenges seems clear. Herat residents, anxious to demonstrate the city's capacity to resist outsiders, take visitors on a journey into hills north of the city, where a shrine has been built at the site of one of the worst atrocities of the war against the Soviet occupation.

On a saddle in the hills overlooking Herat, glass canopies have been erected over pits where Afghan Communists massacred hundreds of Herat residents after an anti-Communist uprising in September 1979.

In local lore, the uprising has joined the challenges Herat offered to past conquerors, including Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane. But if Taliban fighters visiting the shrine absorbed the message, they did not show it. As they peered into the pits where the victims were buried, taking in the bullet-fractured skulls and bones, the rotting clothing and shoes, and the scattered Afghan currency, they seemed unimpressed. ""So? They died,"" one Taliban warrior said.

Some of the Taliban troops seemed to be as much victims of the situation as perpetrators. In a wrecked school that was rebuilt last year by the United Nations, a group of Taliban warriors huddled together in the cold, the bare concrete floor around them littered with vegetable peels. Among the men, all in their early 20s, there was not one who had ever been to school. ""'I've been a fighter ever since I started to grow a beard,"" said Sher Ali, aged 20. ""Since 14, I have been fighting. It's all I have ever known.""

Although he has never read the Koran, Ali said he believed that the Taliban, by following its teachings, would be the salvation of Afghanistan. ""Everything we do will be according to the Holy Koran,"" he said. ""No negative actions will be allowed. Whatever Allah has commanded, as far as possible, we will do."" As for those who defied the Koran, Ali said, tracing a finger first across his neck, then across his forearm, ""We will cut!""

A short distance away, another group, this time of women and babies, sat shivering in another bare concrete room, the malnutrition ward of the main Herat hospital. In a city where one in every five babies dies before reaching its first birthday, professional care in the ward relied until recently on a French doctor assigned to Herat by a Paris-based medical charity, Medicins du Monde. But in January, the doctor, after a shoving match with armed Taliban, was ordered to leave the ward under Taliban strictures on the separation of men and women.

The doctor has kept busy working among refugees in a tented camp on the city's outskirts. But the memory of his banishment rankles the Afghan women staff members, many of them barely trained, who are left to cope with the patients. One woman with a small baby had her own concise opinion on the Taliban.

""I'd like to kill them,"" she said."
18,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"In the four days since Kabul fell to Taliban militias, the capital's one million people have been plunged into the medieval labyrinth that is Taliban rule.

Already, a secretive, six-man ruling council of Islamic clerics has reshaped the everyday lives of ordinary Afghans who, at least in Kabul, long enjoyed one of the most liberal lifestyles of any Muslim community in Central Asia. Cinemas have been closed, the Kabul television station shut down, and the playing of all music has been banned.

A decree on Sunday from the new Department for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prohibition of Vice ordered all men in government jobs to grow ""proper beards"" -- meaning untrimmed ones -- within 45 days. Western-style suits have been banned.

Women and girls have fared worse. Girls' schools have been closed while the clerics, known as mullahs, study the ""issue"" of education for females. Women with jobs have been told to stay at home, and ordered, when venturing out, to wear a full ""chaderi,"" a gown that covers a woman from head to toe, allowing her to see only through a tightly-woven facemask.

On Sunday, there were several instances reported in which Taliban fighters stopped women on Kabul streets and beat them, in one instance with a radio antenna ripped from a car, accusing them of not covering their entire bodies.

The mullahs, who have already imposed changes on the parts of the country that have been under Taliban control, are introducing the capital to sharia, the harsh Islamic criminal code that prescribes stoning to death for adulterers and drug traffickers, amputations of hands and feet for thieves, and flogging for the sale or consumption of liquor. At least one man has already been paraded through the city on a truck, his face blackened, a weight attached to his lower jaw to keep his mouth open, and his left hand severed.

Still, the Taliban capture of the capital, after a 22-month siege, has brought a breath of relief to the people in Kabul. Before the dust storms blew up Monday, shrouding the city in a fine brown haze, the morning sunlight showed the capital in a rare state, with residents moving about without fear of the long-range artillery that has killed at least 30,000 people and reduced much of the city to rubble.

And the voice of the city is changing, too, with people talking about the possibility of an end to the seemingly eternal civil war all across Afghanistan, something many Afghans have long said they would sacrifice almost anything to achieve.

The war began when the Afghan Communist underground seized power in Kabul in a coup in April 1978. In 1979, Soviet paratroops seized Kabul airport to begin a decade-long military occupation. When they pulled out, Najibullah, the Soviet-backed Afghan leader, retained power until 1992. Since, then he had been sheltered in a U.N. compound in Kabul.

After the collapse of Communist rule in 1992, a jumble of guerrilla factions jostled for control of Afghanistan. Burhanuddin Rabbani, one of the faction leaders, became president in the government's most recent incarnation. The Islamic groups that succeeded Najibullah, have been picked off one by one by the Taliban, a movement that sprung out of Islamic religious schools called madrassahs in 1994. The Taliban's pledge was to rid the country of the anarchy fostered by the guerrilla factions.

With their victory at Kabul, the Taliban now control 70 per cent of the country and are fast closing in on the northern 30 per cent that remains under the control of two surviving ethnic militias.

Throughout the day Monday, Taliban fighters in Japanese pick-up trucks were said to be pouring north toward the Salang Tunnel, a Soviet-built feature high in the Hindu Kush mountains that is the last major barrier facing the Taliban before they confront the militias of Gen. Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek, and Ahmad Shah Massoud, a Tajik, who was the military commander in the Kabul government that the Taliban ousted in the offensive that culminated last week.

Dostum, a former communist commander, was reported to have rushed 2,000 troops to the northern end of the tunnel to stage a last-ditch battle for survival.

He is said to fear the same fate as Najibullah.

On Thursday night, fleeing officials of the ousted Rabbani government offered to take Najibullah with them, but he declined, apparently believing the Taliban would not breach the U.N. compound. Taliban fighters dragged Najibullah from the compound at 1.30 a.m. on Friday, and had killed him by 4.30 a.m., U.N. officials said. He had been tortured and shot and his mangled corpse was left hanging alongside his brother's.

It will be a long time before most people in Kabul can think of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist militia force that captured Kabul last week, without jarring recollections of the bloody way in which the fundamentalists introduced themselves to this war-shattered capital.

""Najibullah was a bad Afghan, and a very cruel man,"" said one man who was once a prisoner of the communist secret police. ""But what the Taliban did to him was quite horrible, and now we must think about the kind of people they must be to do such a brutal thing. Maybe our lives now will be even more difficult than before.""

All across Kabul Monday, people lowered their voices when asked about the fate of Najibullah, who was as brutal a ruler as this harsh country has known, but who won grudging respect from many Afghans for his peaceful surrender to the council of former Muslim guerrilla leaders in 1992.

The stillness that came with the end of the fighting in the capital was compounded by an eery emptiness in many streets, partly the result of most women staying home and partly the consequence of a mass exodus to the north, said to have involved as many as 250,000 people, ahead of the Taliban's march into the city.

Traffic moving southwards across the arid plain that separates Kabul from the Hindu Kush suggested the exodus was reversing, but many shops remained shuttered.

One of the few busy spots was at the gates to the Arg Palace, once home to Afghan kings and, since Thursday, headquarters of the Taliban. Hundreds of heavily-beaded Taliban fighters carrying Kalashnikov rifles milled about, many of them southerners from the city of Kandahar, the original base for the Taliban. Kabul people who dare to talk about the Taliban often say that the new rulers' harsh brand of Islam is a product of the walled-off mentality which, these people say, has been characteristic for centuries of Kandahar.

Arabic lettering on the white Taliban flag fluttering atop the palace's clock tower spelled out the Taliban message. ""There is no God but Allah,"" it said, in the most sacred words of the Koran.

Another message came from the Soviet-built tank lurking behind the gates, its barrel festooned with paper flowers. Beggars who are one of the legacies of the war, many of them men missing legs, moved among the Taliban fighters, some distinguishable by white turbans of the kind favored by the ruling mullahs.

After two decades, many people appeared to have decided that there is no choice but to go along with the mullahs, while reserving judgment on what their rule will bring. In the bazaar that crowds along the banks of the Kabul River in the heart of the city, Abdul Jabbar, an 85-year-old pensioner who practiced law under the Afghan monarchy, approached a foreigner to practice what he said was English grown rusty during years of war.

Jabbar, wearing a freshly purchased prayer cap in Taliban white, chose his words carefully. ""We are perhaps a little happy that the Taliban have come, because the fighting is ended,"" he said. ""But in future, we can only be happy if the Taliban do their work well. Everything is in the hands of Allah."""
19,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"Since the Taliban militia forces overran this capital 10 days ago and proclaimed a Muslim fundamentalist government, a ghostly exodus has begun among the Kabul middle class.

Long before dawn, whole families have crept from their homes and headed down to the Kabul River, hauling tin trunks and burlap sacks full of clothing and household goods.

Their destination has been a stretch of broken ground lighted only by the glow from a crescent moon. There, flanked by miles of rubble that is all that is left of much of Kabul, doctors, lawyers and engineers and their fearful-looking families wait for daylight and the minibuses that go east across the mountains to Jalalabad. From there, many switch to camel routes across the mountains into Pakistan to complete their flight from the harsh new world of the Taliban.

The fleeing families have been frightened by decrees that threaten to return Afghanistan to village medievalism, especially for women and girls, whom the Taliban have forbidden to go to work or school.

On Saturday, in a new instance of the rigidities that issue each day from the shadowy Muslim clerics who control the Taliban, Western reporters were summoned to watch a Soviet-built tank roll across a cellar's worth of brandy and beer found in a Kabul hotel.

Taliban decrees range across the gamut of everyday life. Kite flying and marble playing, traditional pastimes among Afghan children, have been banned, as have music and dancing.

Men have been ordered to pray at their neighborhood mosques five times a day. A strict dress code requires women to be shrouded from head to toe and men to abandon Western suits. Other decrees have called for death by stoning for adulterers and amputation of hands and feet for thieves. To many educated Afghans who stuck it out in Kabul through 18 years of war, or who left but returned, the intolerance is the final straw.

While the fundamentalists have brought peace to the 75 per cent of Afghanistan that they control, their assumption of power in Kabul threatens a new and possibly more protracted ordeal -- a narrow, mosque-centered society modeled on life in the mud-walled villages from which many Taliban clerics and fighters have come.

""We don't want to live in a prison, which is what the Taliban are offering us,"" said a physician who was moving furtively through the crowd clamoring for space on the jam-packed minibuses to Jalalabad.

The doctor, who gave his first name as Habibullah, darted back into the crowd, anxious not to draw attention from the hard-eyed Taliban fighters cruising the area to enforce their ban on leaving the country.

Exactly what Taliban control will mean may take months, or even years, to determine. Little is known about their leaders, and in particular about the 38-year-old Muslim cleric, Mullah Mohammed Omar, who heads the Taliban ruling council in the conservative southern city of Kandahar.

Mullah Omar is a former guerrilla commander in the war against the Russians, but he has refused to meet foreigners since helping to establish the Taliban as a fighting force two years ago.

All Are Grateful For End to War
But one thing on which virtually all Afghans in areas under Taliban control can agree is that the fundamentalists have accomplished something that few would have believed possible: putting an end in most of the country to a conflict that evoked the waves of barbarism that swept across Asia in the distant past.

Only ruins are left of the Afghanistan of 1978, when a Communist coup set off a spiral that led to a Soviet combat role, a decade-long Muslim guerrilla struggle and then a savage civil war among more than a dozen guerrilla groups.

The fighting killed an estimated 1.5 million Afghans and severely disabled 500,000, destroyed 10,000 villages and turned the country into a vast scrapyard of abandoned, rusting weaponry.

Nor have many Afghans contested the extraordinary appeal of the Taliban promise to reunite the country. A force unknown to most Afghans only two years ago, they persuaded one regional faction after another to bow to their authority without a fight and achieved their triumph at Kabul as government soldiers abandoned their defenses without firing a shot.

Their successes have owed little to military prowess, since most Taliban fighters are poorly trained village youths with only light weapons. The force that took Kabul probably numbered no more than 1,000, of a total force of about 25,000.

Poor and Hungry Do Not Mind Change
For the vast majority of Afghans who are poor, hungry and illiterate, and who have never known the citified liberties the Taliban are stripping away, the fact that the fundamentalists have routed the warring guerrilla groups is almost the only important issue.

This view is voiced widely even in Kabul, the city considered modern by the standards of Afghanistan, a land where most people continue to live lives that are almost biblical in their adherence to ancient ways.

In Kabul, where the fighting by rival factions has killed tens of thousands of civilians in the last three years, desperation reached the point where people were prepared to pay almost any price to stop the war.

""All that matters is that the fighting has stopped,"" said Sameh, 20, who was begging in the bazaar by the Kabul River one afternoon last week.

Sameh, at one time a guerrilla with the group headed by Ahmad Shah Massoud, the military power behind the defeated government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, lost a leg in the fighting but found like many former guerrillas that the group cared nothing for him once he was wounded. It brushed him aside while its commanders enjoyed the perks of power.

""Perhaps the Taliban will help me,"" he said. ""Nobody else did.""

But for the remnants of the Afghan middle class who were not among the tens of thousands who had already left, the end to the bombing, shelling and sniping has been only one aspect of the Taliban triumph.

While the Taliban have appealed to the professionals to remain and help rebuild Afghanistan, many have either left or are planning to leave because of their fears being trampled under Islamic totalitarianism.

Conciliatory Signals To Outside World
Aware of the menacing image that they have created among educated people at home and in many of the countries that will be needed to help pay for reconstruction here, the Taliban have begun sending out conciliatory signals. They have said they are open to ties with the United States and the rest of the outside world, pleaded for Western aid and hinted that they may review some of their decrees.

At a news conference in Kabul on Sunday, the foreign minister in the provisional government, Mohammed Ghaus Akhund, appealed to foreign aid agencies that support half of Kabul's million residents and many others throughout the country of 16 million for patience.

The aid agencies have appealed to the Taliban to ease the strictures against jobs and education for women. The agencies have been wrestling with how they can continue to feed, clothe and educate Afghans, as well as provide support for much of the country's medical care, without breaching Western human rights concepts by bowing to Taliban rules.

Some programs have been suspended because female aid workers have been forced to stay home, but Mullah Akhund, who appeared for his news conference wearing American-made aviator sunglasses, promised that the restrictions on women and girls would be reviewed once the Taliban controlled all of Afghanistan.

""I am hopeful these small questions will be resolved,"" he said.

But other evidence suggests that the Taliban's decisive voice will be the village mullahs, or clerics, who control the movement from Kandahar, not the more urbane officials who offer reassurance in Kabul.

Afghan Counterpart To Iran's Ayatollahs
Although the Taliban are Sunni Muslims, traditionally hostile to the Shiite Muslims who predominate in Iran, there are ominous signs that the Kandahar clerics could prove as intolerant of dissent as the ayatollahs who took control of Iran in 1979.

In Mullah Omar the Taliban appear to have their own counterpart to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who combined religious and secular power in Iran until his death in 1989.

Mullah Omar was raised in a village outside Kandahar and spent years fighting the Russians, losing his left eye to a sniper bullet. He also studied to become a mullah in the deeply conservative Muslim religious schools called madrassahs.

It was in the madrassahs, some in Afghanistan and some across the border in Pakistan, that the Taliban imbibed a mix of fundamentalism and nationalism that in 1994 brought about a resolve to take up arms and clear Afghanistan of the factionalism and banditry spawned by civil war.

The Taliban took their name from an Arabic term that means religious students, but they were quickly joined by many guerrillas from outside the madrassahs who were equally disillusioned with what had become of the groups that fought the Russians.

As Taliban fighters have swept across Afghanistan, their ruling clerics have said repeatedly that they did not seek power for themselves, only a sort of guarantor's position that would allow them to insure the country's adherence to Islamic principles.

But Afghans say Mullah Omar's actions suggest that he may be planning to install himself as a sort of overlord. They say talk by Taliban officials of establishing a government representative of all groups and opinions in Afghanistan may only be a ploy to head off dissent while the Taliban consolidate their power.

Taliban proclamations identify Mullah Omar as Amir ul-Momineen, an Arabic term meaning prince of the believers that Muslim scholars trace to disciples of Mohammed, more than 1,000 years ago.

The use of the title has shocked many Afghans, as well as Muslims elsewhere, since it implies that he envisages himself as a leader for Muslims beyond Afghanistan. The notion has been further encouraged by his statements citing Taliban fundamentalist practices as an example for other Muslim countries.

Earlier this year, during a sacred festival in Kandahar, Mullah Omar shocked many Afghans by donning a cloak kept for centuries in the city's main mosque that Muslims believe to have been worn by Mohammed.

Moderate Muslims Express Concern
Much behavior has combined with measures likes banning women and girls from school to persuade more moderate Afghan Muslim leaders that Taliban practices are an extreme reaction to the suffering of the last two decades, and not a model for preserving the country's Islamic traditions.

""Islam is a moderate religion, and it does not permit such extremism,"" one of the country's most eminent Muslim scholars said in a private talk with visiting reporters.

The Taliban clerics have mixed calculations with outbursts of violence and anger. After Taliban fighters reached Kabul and summarily killed Najibullah, the country's last Communist president, the clerics said that this was ""not the policy"" of the Taliban and that henceforth opponents would be tried before an Islamic court.

But at other times the clerics themselves have seemed to be barely able to control their passions. Last week, Western reporters were interviewing a Taliban official when Mullah Turabi, put in charge of the Kabul city government by the Taliban, burst into the room wielding a cane.

The mullah, who lost an eye and a leg in the struggle against Soviet forces, berated the official, then struck him on the face. ""How dare you talk to these journalist infidels!"" he said.

Neighboring Lands Issue a Warning
Fear of the Taliban's fundamentalism has reached beyond Afghanistan's borders.

The concern prompted an emergency meeting on Friday among the Muslim-inhabited republics of the former Soviet Union in Almaty, the capital of Kazakstan. Attended by representatives of Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, the meeting issued a warning that the republics, now independent countries with military ties to Russia, would not stand by if a new Taliban offensive carried the fighting close to Afghanistan's northern borders.

Taliban leaders have said they have no intention of exporting fundamentalism. But Mullah Akhund, the provisional foreign minister, became agitated Sunday when he was asked about the warning issued at Almaty, calling it a ""threat and interference"" with overtones of the 1979 invasion.

""If the Russians are considering interfering in our affairs again, they will be making a huge mistake,"" he said."
20,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban," If proof were needed that history takes curious turns, there is evidence in the heavyset warlord with the shoe-brush mustache whose portraits loom over this old Central Asian city. Once a Communist general, he is now spoken of by people in northern Afghanistan as Pasha, a title used by some of the region's ancient kings.

When the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan in 1989, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum seemed washed up.

He was by turns a Communist union boss on an Afghan gas field built by Soviet engineers, leader of an ethnic Uzbek militia that sided with the Soviet occupiers in their war with Muslim guerrillas, and ultimately a major battlefield commander for Afghanistan's Communist dictatorship who won honors for his campaigns against the guerrillas.

But now, long after the guerrillas drove the Russians out and overthrew their proxy government, Dostum seems more powerful than ever.

When he raced southward in his armored Cadillac on Thursday for a clandestine meeting at Khinjan in the Hindu Kush mountains, the 43-year-old general emerged as leader of a kind of ministate in northern Afghanistan.

His alliance hopes to resist the Islamic purists of the Taliban movement who have ousted the guerrillas who defeated the Soviets and overrun most of Afghanistan south of the Hindu Kush.

Some who have watched Dostum (pronounced doe-STUM) believe that his ambitions may run further than stopping the Taliban, who have imposed what they say are Islamic strictures in areas under their control, including bans on women's working and on girls' going to school.

A diplomat here believes the general may see himself emerging from Afghanistan's chaos as the country's new ruler, winning glory for the Uzbeks that has eluded them for 500 years.

""He thinks of himself as the new Tamerlane,"" the diplomat said, referring to the leader of the Uzbek horsemen who conquered Afghanistan in the 14th century, starting an empire that for 150 years controlled all the territory between Baghdad and the western frontier of China.

Dostum is widely popular in Mazar-i-Sharif, the dusty city of 2 million people where he makes his headquarters, and not only among ethnic Uzbeks, many of whom take pride in the martial state he has created, with tank barrels and anti-aircraft guns bristling from every mud-walled fort and hilltop.

For many others, it is the freedoms here, fast disappearing in areas under Taliban control, that make him an icon.

""I think he is a good leader, because people here can live as they want,"" said Latifa Hamidi, 18, who is in her first year of medical studies at Balkh University, an institution financed by Dostum.

Like perhaps half of the population of the city, Ms. Hamidi is a refugee. She comes from Kabul, where her father was killed by a shell five years ago. She has nightmares about what would happen if the Taliban defeated the general and took control here.

""I want knowledge and I want a useful life,"" she said. ""I don't want to be forced to stay at home.""

The state proclaimed at the Khinjan meeting exists mainly on the piece of scrap paper that was scrawled on by one of Dostum's aides, and signed by the general and other anti-Taliban leaders. It has been dismissed by the Taliban, but the rival government the leaders agreed to establish at Mazar-i-Sharif could prove crucial to the future of Central Asia.

Its backers include India, Iran and Russia, which borders on former Soviet republics with large Muslim populations.

Brushing aside the Taliban leaders' promises to live peacefully with their neighbors, the Russian national security adviser, Alexander Lebed, has said the Taliban intend to ""annex"" the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, along with the sacred Muslim cities of Bukhara and Samarkand.

""Are you so surprised we are back?"" Oleg Nevelyaev, Russia's vice consul in Mazar-i-Sharif, said to a reporter as Dostum emerged from the Khinjan meeting and embraced his principal partner in the anti-Taliban alliance, Ahmad Shah Massoud.

The embrace took place in front of an old Soviet guesthouse in a region of barren hills littered with rusting Soviet tanks where Massoud, regarded by Soviet commanders as the most effective Afghan guerrilla commander, harassed Soviet troops throughout the occupation.

If Dostum feels a sense of irony at finding himself a key player in a new Russian gambit in Afghanistan, he shows no sign of it.

He is a bullish man, in stature and in style. He almost always appears in a Soviet-style uniform, as he did at Khinjan, and he presides, from his headquarters in a 150-year-old mud-walled fort outside Mazar-i-Sharif, over a territory where he is as much an overlord as were any of the Communist rulers of the Soviet Union and its satellite states.

One way in which he has achieved his new stature is by letting his military might, based on an army of at least 50,000 men that is undoubtedly the best trained and equipped in Afghanistan, speak for him.

A man of few words, he declined to be interviewed for this article. But he has spoken dismissively of the Taliban, telling aides that he does not intend to submit to a government under which ""there will be no whisky and no music.""

But Dostum is a pragmatist, and when the Taliban overran Kabul last month, he said nothing to make an accommodation impossible. His move to create a new state came only after the Taliban issued a spate of fundamentalist decrees and opened an offensive against Massoud's stronghold north of Kabul, with the implied threat of moving against Dostum.

A willingness to switch sides helped the general survive the collapse of Communist rule. In April 1992 his defection to the Muslim guerrillas besieging the Soviet-backed government in Kabul doomed that government.

Then, after joining the first government established by the anti-Soviet guerrillas, he switched sides again and shelled Kabul for months, killing tens of thousands of people. Then he retreated to the north, consolidating his grip on an area that now covers six provinces, with perhaps 5 million people.

While many are Uzbeks, the population of the region also includes many ethnic Tajiks, Hazaras and Pathans, the largest group in Afghanistan, and the one from which the Taliban have drawn almost all their support.

Since the Taliban seized Kabul, a new wave of refugees has streamed north across the mountains, and what they have found here has entranced them.

While much of the rest of Afghanistan is in ruins, Mazar-i-Sharif, trading with the newly independent states of what was Soviet Central Asia, is thriving. Its bazaars are packed with imported goods, including such luxuries as satellite telephones.

Dostum, who has grown rich from taxing the new trade, has started his own airline, Balkh Air, with two British-made jets that fly to destinations in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf.

With its dusty streets and chromed pickup trucks and the macho mood of many Uzbeks, the city seems tailor-made for the general. When a visitor inquired about the price of a volume of plays at a bookshop in the bazaar, the merchant suggested that he buy a set of chest expanders instead.

And at Dostum's headquarters, fighters relaxing in the afternoon sun guffawed when a reporter suggested that future battles with the Taliban might be fierce.

""The Taliban?"" said Mohammed Siddiq, one of the general's commanders. ""Compared with us, they are a bunch of women."""
21,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"When a band of Afghan fighters rose before dawn Monday at a smoky inn in this village high in the Hindu Kush mountains, the prospect before them was much the same as it has been since the war here began with a Communist coup nearly two decades ago.

From all that the fighters said during a night resting at the inn, the outlook is for more long, dusty days tramping across inhospitable hills or bouncing in open trucks down rocky roads, with little awaiting them but the next skirmish. For many of them, fighting is the only life they have ever known.

But during hours spent sharing the fighters' evening meal of boiled rice and their dormitory on a bare mud floor at the back of the inn, their nonchalance was striking.

Among the fighters, there seemed to be little sense of a life beyond their ragtag existence in the Afghan hinterland. There were no complaints, even from men with no laces for the battered street shoes that serve as combat boots, no openly expressed fears of death in a war that has killed hundreds of thousands like them, not even much that could be called hope.

There was only a general sense that a life spent roaming this ancient land in pursuit of battle was about all that any Afghan man could expect.

""We are fighters -- that is what we do,"" said a man who gave his name as Shamsuddin, 45, a commander in the guerrilla force of Ahmad Shah Massoud.

He spoke during a break from an evening spent listening to bulletins on the Afghan fighting squawking from a short-wave radio tuned to Radio Tehran. The Iranian broadcasts are much favored among the Persian-speaking men of the ethnic Tajik minority in Afghanistan who are the bulk of Massoud's force.

From the grins that the commander's remark prompted among fellow fighters grouped about him in the glow of a kerosene lamp, it seemed that they, too, considered questions about their personal feelings to be effete or irrelevant.

They did not even seem much interested in the complex politics of the war, which has provided them with a kaleidoscope of enemies, some of whom have been allies, then enemies, then allies again. The rule seemed to be that they fight whomever the commander chooses.

At the moment, the enemy is the Islamic movement known as the Taliban, which captured Kabul, the Afghan capital, from the Massoud forces last month, then set about imposing a strict system that includes bans on women working, on girls going to school and even on the playing of soccer.

The Massoud forces have taken the lead in counterattacking the Taliban north of Kabul, striking in recent days at targets as close as five miles from the capital's northern outskirts.

The Massoud forces are newly aligned with two other ethnic armies, the Uzbek-dominated force of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and the Shiite Muslim force of Hazaras under Abdul Karim Khalily, which have pledged to resist the Taliban, who are mainly from the ethnic Pathan majority in Afghanistan.

But in this valley, as in many other regions of northeastern Afghanistan, there is plenty of evidence, in ruined villages and blasted bridges, of the fighting that pitted the Massoud forces against the fighters of Dostum and Khalily until only a month ago, before the Taliban united former enemies against them by taking Kabul.

For the Massoud men at Doab, Radio Tehran has provided the fighting rationale of the moment: that the Taliban have been armed and financed by Pakistan and the United States, and are therefore no better than the Russians who sent an occupying force to Afghanistan for a decade in the 1980s, or for that matter the British who invaded Afghanistan twice in the 19th century.

""The Taliban are puppets of Pakistan,"" the Massoud fighters said in a chorus that rang through the evening. ""We will drive them out of Kabul.""

But in the end, it seemed that it was the fighting, not the enemy, that mattered most. The evening was punctuated by bloodthirsty gestures that needed no translation, ranging from leveled Kalashnikov rifles and the staccato noises of automatic fire to hands strangling an imaginary foe.

It is a mood like this that has troubled the handful of Afghan psychologists who have not joined the middle-class exodus abroad. They have been saying for years that even if the fighting stops, Afghanistan will have to contend for decades with the tortured psychology of men who have known nothing but war.

The good-humored camaraderie of the Massoud fighters, some of whom gave up their own blankets to two Western reporters to ward off the night chill, seemed all the more remarkable for the hardships of the terrain they have been assigned to hold, and to recapture every time it has been lost.

Only three days ago, when the Massoud fighters were further up the valley, the village of Doab shifted its allegiances to the Taliban, posting a white Taliban flag on a pole atop a part of the main street that was bombed to a shell by Soviet aircraft a decade ago. The next day, as the Massoud forces approached, the village shifted back.

Doab -- the name means ""two rivers"" in Dari, the Persian dialect spoken by Afghanistan's Tajik people -- is in the heart of the Bamian region of the Hindu Kush, about 60 miles west of the Salang Highway that connects Kabul to northern Afghanistan through the mountains.

To reach here from the highway requires a 12-hour journey along a narrow, unpaved road made almost impassable by huge, knife-edged boulders, waist-high floods and bridges across plunging rivers that the fighting has reduced to little more than tangled masses of iron and wood.

To drive the road is to pass through a patchwork of territories, some only a mile or two along the riverbank, that are controlled by the different military factions belonging to the new anti-Taliban alliance.

At the checkpoints, trucks carrying cargos of rice and wheat -- and sometimes flatbeds full of Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara families fleeing Taliban rule in Kabul -- are charged tolls by teen-age fighters waving rifles.

Each halt has a commander who seems to report to nobody but himself, eager to show off his small band of fighters and his armory of battered Soviet weapons to passing foreigners.

Often there is enough bombast for a comic opera. ""There is no way out for the Taliban fighters,"" Sherdat Fedayi, 50, a commander in the Dostum forces, said at a checkpoint a few miles east of Doab. ""They will soon be surrounded by us to the north, the south, the east and the west.""

As his men gathered around him, Fedayi pointed south toward Kabul and added, ""The only escape for them is to the cemetery."""
22,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"In a country where at least 10,000 villages have been bombed, shelled and burned into rubble, the razing of one more hamlet can pass almost unnoticed. For hundreds of thousands of Afghan families who have lost their homes, the anonymity of the loss only adds to the pain.

So when a battered Kabul taxi arrived here Thursday morning, smoke still rising and the smell of torched ruins heavy in the air, villagers clamored to tell outsiders how Sar Cheshma had died.

Hastening down narrow lanes between fire-blackened houses, the handful of people remaining in the village abandoned for a moment their rush to board trucks waiting to carry them away as refugees.

The villagers' story has been a familiar one in the 18 years that Afghanistan has been at war. The twist this time was that the men who destroyed Sar Cheshma were the turbaned warriors of the Taliban, the ultra-conservative Muslims who have imposed a medieval social order across much of Afghanistan.

Two years ago, the Taliban sprang from religious schools with a promise to suppress the carnage that has killed an estimated 1.5 million Afghans and driven millions of others from their homes.

The villagers of Sar Cheshma say 30 Taliban fighters swept in at dawn on Tuesday, then spent several hours pouring canisters of gasoline into the 120 courtyard houses and setting them on fire.

Sar Cheshma lies barely five miles from the northern outskirts of Kabul, the capital, where the Taliban forces are fighting a village-by-village battle with the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, a less conservative Muslim leader whose troops used Sar Cheshma briefly on Monday as a base to fire on the Taliban.

A young mother and her three sons were killed by a Taliban rocket fired when the Massoud forces were in the village.

There were no further deaths in the torching that nearly obliterated the village. But in one mud-walled courtyard after another, where hundreds of people lived, little remains but buckled bed frames, melted kitchen utensils and charred piles of grain.

""Are we not humans?"" sobbed a 45-year-old woman named Narwaz, rushing forward with others to greet visitors who had slipped past Taliban checkpoints posted to keep outsiders away.

Beside her, a villager named Khairuddin, 55, waved a bloodied burqa, the head-to-toe shroud that the Taliban force all women to wear outside their homes. The garment was all that remained of his daughter, the woman killed with her sons in the Taliban rocket attack.

In a home up one of the village's dusty pathways, another man, Najmuddin, 30, broke away from sifting through his blackened grain supply, hoping to find enough uncharred bits to carry away.

Suddenly, the grain forgotten, his face contorted, he rushed to fetch a metal bowl piled high with ashes that had been balanced on a section of broken wall. It was all that remained of a copy of the Koran that he said had been in his family for generations.

""Tyrants! Tyrants!"" he shouted, referring to the Taliban. ""This is the book of God. Kill us if you must, but don't burn our holy book!""

Their attention attracted by his cries, several neighbors rushed forward, one with a large metal plate sitting among the utensils that Najmuddin had saved from the fire. Reverentially, Najmuddin placed the bowl with the ashes onto the plate and carried it away.

""We honor these ashes,"" he said, weeping. ""The Koran is the book of God.""

The shock of what happened here appeared to be all the greater among the villagers because the perpetrators were the Taliban.

When they emerged as a fighting force in 1994, the Taliban presented themselves as the harbingers of a new Afghanistan, modeled on the teachings of the Koran and inspired by a burning zeal to reunify the country.

From their original base in the southern city of Kandahar, they swept east and west, suppressing local militias that had reduced much of the country to anarchy. The Muslim clerics who led the Taliban promised that their forces would set new standards of decency in the fighting.

Taliban units appear to have avoided raping and pillaging in the manner of most of the other Afghan forces that have fought in the civil war. But they have become widely hated for the draconian social order laid down by the Taliban leaders, which bans women from working outside the home and girls from going to school, requires men to grow beards and forbids children to fly kites or play soccer.

Since Kabul fell to the Taliban four weeks ago, there has been a series of uprisings against them in towns and villages north of the capital. Now the Taliban have gone a step further, using tactics indistinguishable from those of other forces that have contributed to the country's destruction.

Today, two days after the attack on Sar Cheshma, Taliban jets bombed Kalakan, a village under the control of the Massoud forces about 10 miles further north. According to an account by a reporter for the BBC who visited the village, the bombing killed 20 civilians.

Scene of Fighting Against Russians
In the case of Sar Cheshma, the Taliban attack was the latest in a series of disasters. The residents have repeatedly found themselves in the middle of the fighting because of the village's strategic position, hard up against the Ghoza mountain range, which runs like a shield across the northwestern flank of Kabul.

In the decade that Soviet forces were here, Sar Cheshma became a stronghold for the Muslim guerrillas who ultimately drove out the Soviet troops.

Soviet bombers pounded the village more than once, leaving jagged ruins where mudwalled homes once stood and forcing many villagers to flee to Pakistan and Iran as refugees. Some returned after the Russians left, but barely a third of the village's 300 homes were occupied this week.

In the atmosphere of panic that gripped Sar Cheshma Thursday, many villagers said the Taliban were worse than the Russians.

""We killed more than 40 Russian soldiers in this village, but they never burned our houses,"" said Nizamuddin, 35, who like most others here had supported his family by raising livestock and working a small plot of land.

Again and again the villagers voiced special loathing for the Taliban because of the religious movement's claim to be the true upholders of the Koran.

""Didn't they do a wonderful job here, these Muslims?"" said Nizamuddin, leading the visitors on a house-by-house tour. ""Wasn't this burning of our village a true act of faith? We should applaud them -- they are surely the best Muslims in the world.""

If razing the village showed how none of the armies fighting for control of Afghanistan shows much mercy for civilians, it also demonstrated that the war has gone beyond a competition between faiths and ideologies and become little more than an ethnic struggle.

One reason the Taliban have been driven back so quickly from the northward advances they made after overrunning Kabul is that many villages dotting the dusty plain between Kabul and the Hindu Kush mountains 60 miles to the north are inhabited by ethnic Tajiks, the second-largest population group in Afghanistan.

All but a tiny minority of Taliban fighters are from the Pathan ethnic group, which is the largest in Afghanistan, accounting for about half the country's 16 million people.

As a Tajik village, Sar Cheshma was a natural attraction for Massoud's forces, and a natural target for Taliban suspicion. The villagers say Taliban fighters arrived last weekend, summoned them and ordered them to surrender all of their weapons. This done, the Taliban departed with a warning that any attempt by Massoud forces to enter the village should be reported immediately to a nearby Taliban post.

""We gave them our Kalashnikovs, and they said they would protect us,"" said the villager named Khairuddin.

On Monday, the villagers said, they awoke to find that a group of Massoud fighters under the command of a Muslim cleric from the village, Mullah Taj Mohammed, had slipped into Sar Cheshma overnight.

The Massoud fighters ordered the villagers to stay in their homes, making any warning to the Taliban impossible, the villagers said. A brief battle followed, they said, in which Khairuddin's family members were killed, then the Massoud fighters slipped away to the mountains, leaving the villagers to face the Taliban's wrath at first light on Tuesday.

For most of the villagers, the immediate future appears to lie in joining hundreds of thousands of refugees in Kabul, many of them so destitute that they wander the streets begging.

But one Sar Cheshma resident said she was finished with fleeing. Sajida, 40, a widow, clutched her son, Abdullah, 12, and said she would stay amid the ruins of her home.

Six years ago, her husband, an officer in the Communist army that disintegrated in 1992, was killed by a guerrilla rocket in Kabul. ""I left Kabul to escape from the fighting,"" she said, ""but the fighting has followed me wherever I have gone. Now, if I must, I will stay and die here."""
23,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"When the Taliban religious movement decided to stone to death a couple caught in adultery, it chose a blazing afternoon in late August.

The suffocating desert heat had pushed temperatures past 100 degrees, but those who were there remember how the townspeople came by the thousands to witness a spectacle not seen in Kandahar for decades.

Long before the condemned couple arrived on the flatbed of a truck, their hands and feet tightly bound, every vantage point around the forecourt of Id Gah Mosque was taken. Still, according to the Muslim traditions of Afghanistan, space was made so that relatives of the condemned pair, including small children, could have a clear view of the type of justice preferred by the Taliban, which now controls three-quarters of the country.

The condemned woman, Nurbibi, 40, was lowered into a pit dug into the earth beside the wall until only her chest and head were above ground. Witnesses said she was dressed in a sky-blue burqa, the head-to-toe shroud with a slit for the eyes that the Taliban require all women to wear when they are outside their homes.

Nurbibi's stepson and lover, Turyalai, 38, was taken to a spot about 20 paces away, blindfolded and turned to face the Muslim cleric who was their judge.

Those close enough to have heard said the cleric spoke briefly about the provisions for stoning adulterers in the Sharia, the ancient Muslim legal code imposed by the Taliban since they began their rise to power in Kandahar two years ago.

Then, those witnesses said, the judge, following tradition, stooped to pick up the first stone from one of two piles that had been prepared, one for each of the condemned pair.

The first stone, the witnesses said, was thrown at Nurbibi. Quickly, Taliban fighters who had been summoned for the occasion stepped forward and launched a cascade of stones, each big enough to fill the palms of their hands. A man who stepped forward from the crowd to join in the stoning, Rahmatullah, 25, said neither Nurbibi nor Turyalai had cried out.

Turyalai, he said, appeared to be dead after about 10 minutes, but the killing of Nurbibi took longer, past the point where one of her sons, stepping forward to check, turned to the judge to say his mother was still alive.

""The son was crying,"" Rahmatullah said. ""I could see it.""

At that point, several witnesses said, one of the Taliban fighters picked up a large rock, advanced toward Nurbibi and dropped it on her head, finishing her off.

Among the score of people who gathered before the mosque to offer their recollections of the stoning, none expressed dismay. To the contrary, all -- men and boys, since women in Kandahar are forbidden by Taliban rules to linger in public places or to speak to strangers -- spoke with enthusiasm of the killings.

""It was a good thing, the only way to end this kind of sinning,"" said Mohammed Younus, 60, a teacher.

Mohammed Karim, a 24-year-old Taliban fighter, picked up several stones and threw them in an impromptu re-enactment of the executions. ""No, I didn't feel sorry for them at all,"" he said. ""I was just happy to see Sharia being implemented.""

Court-ordered executions of adulterers by stoning have been reported occasionally in revolutionary Iran, but since World War II this punishment has not been imposed in Afghanistan -- until the Taliban took power in Kandahar.

The Muslim mullah who led the investigation that resulted in the stoning of Nurbibi and Turyalai, Mohammed Wali, says the incident was at least the third stoning for adultery in the Kandahar region since the Taliban took power. Several others have been reported in other areas under Taliban control.

Wali heads the Taliban's religious police, the Office for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prohibition of Vice. Encountered by chance in the courtyard of a Taliban office building in Kandahar, where he was relaxing with some of his investigators in the shade of a mulberry tree, Wali, 35, said the stonings of Nurbibi and Turyalai had given him great satisfaction.

""When I see this kind of thing, I am very happy, because it means that the rule of Islam is being implemented,"" he said.

The Taliban take care to see that foreigners, especially non-Muslims, are kept away from stonings and amputations, which Taliban leaders like Wali describe as religious occasions not to be witnessed by nonbelievers. But the executions of Nurbibi and Turyalai were openly discussed with foreigners outside the mosque and in the Id Gah Bazaar, just down the road, where Turyalai had been a motorcycle salesman.

But a first attempt by Western reporters to talk to the family of the victims was angrily aborted by the Taliban. Making their way to the Naido district of the city, an area where thousands live among rubble left when Soviet aircraft carpet-bombed the southern districts of Kandahar in 1986, the reporters found a small boy who led them up an alleyway to a heavy wooden door in a 10-foot-high mud wall.

Moments later, an elderly woman, Sidiqa, who was Turyalai's aunt, appeared at the door and, with neighbors, began to relate the story of the stoning.

But two young Taliban fighters who had been posted to keep watch on the district, one armed with a Kalashnikov rifle, quickly arrived, ordering the foreigners to leave. When they delayed, one of the fighters turned to the gathering crowd. ""Pick up stones,"" he said.

The visitors retreated, followed by angry youths throwing stones and rotting corncobs. But at dawn the next day, a second visit to the family went unnoticed by the Taliban. Family members and neighbors appeared eager to tell their story, gathering around to speak of Nurbibi and Turyalai and how their relationship led to death.

By the family's accounts, the events that led to the stoning began 13 years ago, when Turyalai's father died of a stomach ailment. Nurbibi, the father's second wife, was more than 20 years younger than her husband, and was left with two young sons. She remained in her husband's home, along with Turyalai, who was the son of her husband by his first wife.

Under Muslim tradition, any intimate relationship between Nurbibi and her stepson was forbidden, and in any event, Turyalai was married and had a growing family of his own.

Nazaneen, Turyalai's wife, who spoke from inside the family home through a half-opened door, said she had long known of the close relationship between her husband and Nurbibi but had not been concerned about it until recently.

""I knew that they were intimate with each other, but I felt it was the relationship of a mother and a son,"" she said. ""But then I became suspicious of them, and finally my suspicions were confirmed.""

""Of course,"" she added, ""I know that Turyalai was not in love with her, but some evil force must have drawn them together.""

Some neighbors hinted that the tipoff to the Taliban came from Nazaneen. But a man who said he was a cousin of Turyalai said the Taliban had been alerted by Nurbibi's two teen-age sons, Habibullah and Asmatullah, who were angered by their mother's infidelity.

""They went to the Taliban and told them that their mother was having a sexual relationship with her stepson,"" the man said.

A few nights later, several family members said, a group of men from the Taliban's religious police hid themselves on the roof of an adjoining house. In summer, many Afghans relax and sleep at night on the flat roofs of their homes, and Nurbibi and Turyalai were together on the roof when the Taliban sprang from their hiding place.

""They caught them red-handed,"" one man said. ""There wasn't any doubt about it.""

Under the Sharia, conviction for adultery requires four witnesses; in this case they were the men from the Taliban. Family members say the couple were imprisoned immediately and held for a month before the Thursday in August when they were taken out and stoned. Between them, Nurbibi and Turyalai left 10 children, and all eight of Turyalai's were under the age of 13.

The oldest of his children, Gulalai, 12, stood listening to accounts of the stoning with her youngest brother, Nadirjan, 3 months, swaddled in her arms, then burst out with her own account.

""I saw it,"" she said. ""I was on a truck and I saw it."" Then she turned, tears in her eyes, and fled into the house."
24,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"On a recent visit to the ruins of the National Museum of Afghanistan, where he served as curator, Najibullah Popal turned momentarily to pause beside a gaping hole in the masonry.

""Excuse me,"" Popal said, standing where a howitzer shell had punched a hole the size of a truck in a gallery wall. ""Every time I come here I feel terrible. I wish to God I had never lived to see this.""

After 18 years of war, Afghanistan's present lies in ruins. At the National Museum, its past does, too.

Off dank corridors lighted by shafts of daylight penetrating shell holes in the roof, galleries are littered with the rubble of ancient ceramics, statues and friezes. Broken display cabinets stand emptied of their ivories and paintings and frescoes, and of their kings' treasures of silver and gold.

Some rooms are filled with bearded young fighters from the Taliban religious movement, who in September became the latest of the Afghan armies to seize the capital, and the latest to set up a military post in what remains of the museum.

The war, and looting for illegal sales on the international antiquities market, have destroyed a museum that was a repository of Afghanistan's history and culture, the most comprehensive record anywhere of civilizations that thrived along the ancient Silk Road that crossed Afghanistan on its way from Europe to China.

The collection spanned more than 50,000 years -- from cave-dwelling tribes that lived along the Oxus River to early Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic dynasties that achieved soaring levels of scholarship and artistry at a time when much of Europe was seized with barbarism, and on to the Durrani kings, who ruled Afghanistan for 250 years before the current upheavals.

With at least 70 percent of the collection gone, experts like Popal believe that the museum can never be restored. His main hope, for now, is that what remains of the collection, packed up and removed from the museum by Afghanistan's communist rulers before the plundering began in earnest in 1992, can itself be saved from looting.

But after three governments in the four years since communist rule collapsed, Popal is not sure who controls that hoard.

""I spent 25 years here, and it has all come to nothing,"" he said.

The museum's destruction, and the scattering of thousands of its most prized objects into international art markets, have been little more than a footnote to the larger human miseries of the Afghan conflict, which has killed an estimated 1.5 million people since the first shots were fired in 1978.

But many people believe that the museum's loss symbolizes not only the barbarism that has overwhelmed the country, but also the ways in which the disaster has been manipulated by outside powers.

According to experts who are trying to trace the tens of thousands of items that have disappeared from the museum and to halt the plunder that continues at scores of other archaeological sites across Afghanistan, the various Afghan factions that have taken their turns in looting the museum, the Islamic guerrillas known as mujahedeen, have acted at the direction of an international network of middle-men, dealers and collectors.

Ignoring appeals from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which helped to finance an abortive attempt to save the collection after the first outbreaks of looting, and from organizations in the international art world that monitor the sale of stolen treasures, these experts say, agents and buyers as far afield as London, Jidda and Tokyo have made millions of dollars from trading in the Afghan treasures.

""This wasn't just a case of mujahedeen running through the museum and filling their pockets,"" said Nancy Hatch Dupree, an American historian and writer on Afghanistan who worked on several major archaeological excavations in Afghanistan in the 1960s and 1970s with her late husband, the American archaeologist and historian Louis Dupree.

""We know that this was much more systematic, and it went on for a very long time,"" she said. ""The people who did this, and the people for whom they were doing it, knew exactly what they were after.""

Mrs. Dupree, 70, is part of a small group of people who have banded together as the Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage, dedicated to spreading an awareness of what is being lost, and to efforts, so far largely unavailing, to halt the destruction.

The group operates from cramped offices in Peshawar, the Pakistani frontier city on the border with Afghanistan, which has become a sort of clearing house for the artifacts looted from the national museum and other sites.

For centuries, Peshawar, just east of the Khyber Pass, has been known for the skulduggery that stalks its sinuous bazaars. In one tiny storefront after another, turbaned merchants sit cross-legged on threadbare carpets, trading in gold and jewelry, in money and in spices, in guns and fighting bantams -- and, when the shutters are closed, in drugs, stolen antiquities and other contraband. It is here that contacts are made that eventually result in Afghan treasures reaching collectors homes around the world.

At hotels like the Pearl Continental in Peshawar, antiquities experts from London, Hong Kong and Tokyo entertain one another with stories of being led into Peshawar's bazaars, and on from there to remote frontier villages, to view ancient Buddha heads and jeweled caskets and exquisitely incised ivory panels, some of which eventually sell for half a million dollars and more.

Mrs. Dupree has herself been offered some items from the Kabul museum, still bearing the handwritten numbers and codes that identify them as part of the museum's collection.

""I have actually held some of these things in my hands,"" Mrs. Dupree said, paging through the illustrations in a Kabul museum guidebook she wrote with her husband in 1974. She paused at a photograph of one of the most prized of the museum's objects, a second century A.D. ivory coffer lid showing bare-breasted courtesans. It was from the so-called Bagram collection unearthed in the 1930s by an expedition that discovered the remains of the ancient city of Kapisa beneath the modern village of Bagram, 40 miles north of Kabul.

""I was offered this for $250,000,"" she said.

But the most that Mrs. Dupree and her associates have been able to offer for any of the plundered objects is a few thousand dollars, raised by private appeals to philanthropists with an interest in Central Asian art.

Meanwhile, stories flood in of powerful Pakistani politicians, Central Asian art experts of international renown, and even some of the best-known international art auction houses knowingly joining in the illicit trade in the looted Afghan pieces.

Naseerullah Babar, a retired Pakistan army general and former government official, has acknowledged publicly that he paid $100,000 for an ivory piece from the Bagram collection. When he was asked about the purchase by The Herald, a Pakistani news magazine, Babar said he intended to hold the piece ""in safe-keeping"" until peace is restored in Afghanistan.

Mrs. Dupree told of another case in which a noted British art historian was asked by a major auction house in London to evaluate an ancient Islamic piece from the Kabul museum.

Despite Unesco's appeal to art dealers and collectors to ""respect scrupulously the interests of the Afghan people by refraining from acquiring objects that might have been stolen from them,"" Mrs. Dupree said, the art scholar completed the evaluation but never contacted the Afghan heritage group or Unesco. As for the auction house concerned, one with a worldwide reputation, Mrs. Dupree snorted.

""Those people are all nice on the outside, but you can't believe a word that they say,"" she said.

Mrs. Dupree has reports and photographs from widely scattered parts of Afghanistan indicating that the plunder has gone far beyond the Kabul museum. Mujahedeen commanders have been using pickaxes, bulldozers and even land mines to ravage sites like Balkh, an ancient city in northern Afghanistan that was once a crossroads of ancient civilizations.

While the conflict in Afghanistan began almost 20 years ago with a communist coup in 1978, and worsened rapidly after Soviet troops intervened to save the faltering communist government in December 1979, Popal said the museum was not damaged while Soviet troops remained in Kabul, up to their withdrawal in February 1989, and for three years afterward, while a communist government remained in power.

The problem began, he said, almost as soon as the Muslim guerrilla groups captured the capital in April 1992. These groups were armed with billions of dollars of weapons by the United States, Saudi Arabia and other countries that became part of the anti-Soviet coalition after 1979, but they proved incapable of governing, or of overcoming deep ethnic and religious differences, after the communists surrendered power.

A new civil war ensued, and the museum, in the heart of the strategic Darulaman district, was one of the early casualties.

On May 12, 1993, a rocket slammed into the the museum's roof, destroying a fourth-century A.D. wall painting from northern Afghanistan and burying much of the museum's ancient pottery and bronzes under tons of debris. In the three years since, every effort to limit further damage has been frustrated by the endless turns of the war, with first one guerrilla group, then another, taking control of the area and ransacking the museum.

While the looters have scattered much of the museum's collection, one part of it that they were denied was the so-called Tillya-Tepe collection of 21,000 Bactrian gold objects, unearthed by Russian archaeologists in northern Afghanistan in 1978.

Considered by experts to be beyond valuation, the collection was gathered from six burial mounds dating from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D. On the orders of President Najibullah, Kabul's last communist ruler, the entire collection was removed to storage vaults in the presidential palace in 1989.

Although rumors have spoken of some of the Bactrian pieces reaching international markets, Popal said he had been assured by Taliban leaders that the entire collection was still safe, in the vaults, and would remain there.

Popal says that its significance to Afghans is beyond price. ""The rest is gone,"" he said. ""But if we have the Bactrian gold, we have something left to prove to the world that there was a time when we were not barbarians."""
25,NYT,Burns,1997,Afghanistan Taliban,"When neighbors came to Mullah Mohammed Omar in the spring of 1994, they had a story that was shocking even by the grim standards of Afghanistan's 18-year-old civil war.

Two teen-age girls from the mullah's village of Singesar had been abducted by one of the gangs of mujahedeen, or ""holy warriors,"" who controlled much of the Afghan countryside. The girls' heads had been shaved, they had been taken to a checkpoint outside the village and they had been repeatedly raped.

At the time, Omar was an obscure figure, a former guerrilla commander against occupying Soviet forces who had returned home in disgust at the terror mujahedeen groups were inflicting on Afghanistan.

He was living as a student, or talib, in a mud-walled religious school that centered on rote learning of the Koran.

But the girls' plight moved him to act. Gathering 30 former guerrilla fighters, who mustered between them 16 Kalashnikov rifles, he led an attack on the checkpoint, freed the girls and tied the checkpoint commander by a noose to the barrel of an old Soviet tank. As those around him shouted ""God is Great!"" Omar ordered the tank barrel raised and left the dead man hanging as a grisly warning.

The Singesar episode is now part of Afghan folklore. Barely 30 months after taking up his rifle, Omar is the supreme ruler of most of Afghanistan. The mullah, a heavyset 38-year old who lost his right eye in the war against the Russians, is known to his followers as Prince of All Believers. He leads an Islamic religious movement, the Taliban, that has conquered 20 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces.

Omar's call to arms in Singesar is only part of the story of the rise of the Taliban that emerged from weeks of traveling across Afghanistan and from scores of interviews with Afghans, diplomats and others who followed the movement from its earliest days in 1994.

It is a story that is still unfolding, with the Taliban struggling to consolidate their hold on Kabul, the capital. The city fell three months ago to a Taliban force of a few thousand fighters who entered the city with barely a shot fired.

But the Taliban, despite their protestations of independence, did not score their successes alone. Pakistani leaders saw domestic political gains in supporting the movement, which draws most of its support from the ethnic Pashtun who predominate along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

Perhaps more important, Pakistan's leaders, in funneling supplies of ammunition, fuel and food to the Taliban, hoped to advance an old Pakistani dream of linking their country, through Afghanistan, to an economic and political alliance with the Muslim states of Central Asia.

At crucial moments during the two years of the Taliban's rise to power, the United States stood aside. It did little to discourage support for the Afghan mullahs both from Pakistan and from another American ally, Saudi Arabia, which found its own reasons for supporting the Taliban in their conservative brand of Islam.

American officials emphatically deny the assertion, widely believed among the Taliban's opponents in Afghanistan, that the United States offered the movement covert support. American diplomats' frequent visits to Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban's governing body, the officials insist, were mainly exploratory.

In fact, American policy on the Taliban has seesawed back and forth. The Taliban have found favor with some American officials, who see in their implacable hostility toward Iran an important counterweight in the region.

But other officials remain uncomfortable about the Taliban's policies on women, which they say have created the most backward-looking and intolerant society anywhere in Islam. And they say that the Taliban, despite promises to the contrary, have done nothing to root out the narcotics traffickers and terrorists who have found a haven in Afghanistan under the mujahedeen.

In its most recent policy statement on Afghanistan, the State Department called on other nations to ""engage"" with the Taliban in hopes of moderating their policies.

But the statement came as the Taliban were tightening still further their Islamic social code, particularly the taboos that have banned women from working, closed girls' schools, and required all women beyond puberty to cloak themselves head-to-toe in garments called burqas that are the traditional garb of Afghan village women.

The result, so far, is that not a single one of the member countries of the United Nations has recognized the Taliban government and none have come forward with offers of the reconstruction aid the Taliban say will be needed to rebuild this shattered country. In the words of Mullah Mohammed Hassan, one of Omar's partners in the Taliban's ruling council, ""We are the pariahs of the world.""

How the Taliban succeeded in pacifying much of a country that had spent years spiraling into chaos is not, as their progress from Singesar to Kabul attests, primarily a question of military prowess.

Much more, it was a matter of a group of Islamic nationalists catching a high tide of discontent that built up when the mujahedeen turned from fighting Russians to plundering, and just as often killing, their own people. By 1994, after five years of mujahedeen terror, the Taliban was a movement whose time had come.

One man who has seen more of the Taliban than any other outsider, Rahimullah Yusufzai, a reporter for The News in Pakistan, put it simply: ""The story of the Taliban is not one of outsiders imposing a solution, but of the Aghans themselves seeking deliverance from mujahedeen groups that had become cruel and inhuman. The Afghan people had been waiting a long time for relief from their miseries, and they would have accepted anybody who would have freed them from the tyranny.""

In any case, Omar contends that the decision to act at Singesar was not, at the time, envisaged as a step toward power.

Although he is universally known in Afghanistan as mullah, or giver of knowledge, he is a shy man who still calls himself a talib, or seeker after knowledge. He has met only once with a foreign reporter, Yusufzai. Omar said at their meeting in Kandahar that the men at Singesar intended originally only to help local villagers.

""We were fighting against Muslims who had gone wrong,"" he said. ""How could we remain quiet when we could see crimes being committed against women, and the poor?""

But appeals were soon coming in from villages all around Kandahar. At about the time the two girls were being abducted in Singesar, which is in the Maiwand district 35 miles to the west, two other mujahedeen commanders had confronted each other with tanks in a bazaar in Kandahar, arguing over possession of a young boy both men wanted as a homosexual partner.

In the ensuing battle, dozens of civilians shopping and trading in the bazaar were killed. After the Taliban took control of Kandahar, those commanders, too, ended up hanging from Taliban nooses.

With each new action against the mujahedeen, the Taliban's manpower, and arsenal, grew. Mujahedeen fighters, and sometimes whole units, switched sides, so that the Taliban quickly came to resemble a coalition of many of the country's fighting groups. The new recruits included many men who had served in crucial military positions as pilots, tank commanders and front-line infantry officers in the Afghan Communist forces that fought under Soviet control in the 1980's.

After a skirmish in September 1994, at Spin Boldak on the border with Pakistan, netted the new movement 800 truckloads of arms and ammunition that had been stored in caves since the Soviet occupation, there was no force to match the Taliban. Moving rapidly east and west of Kandahar in the winter of 1994 and the spring of 1995, they rolled up territory. Sometimes, using money said to have come from Saudi Arabia, Taliban commanders paid mujahedeen commanders to give up.

But mostly, it was enough for Taliban units to appear on the horizon with the fluttering white flags symbolizing their Islamic puritanism. ""In most places, the people welcomed the Taliban as a deliverance, so there was no need to fight,"" recalled Yusufzai, the Pakistani reporter.

Another event in Sept. 1994 gave the Taliban their most important external backer.

Naseerullah Babar, Pakistan's interior minister, had a vision for extricating his wedge-shaped country from the precarious position in which it was placed when it was created in 1947 by the partition of India from territories running along British India's frontiers with Afghanistan.

Babar saw a Pakistan linked to the newly independent Muslim republics of what had been Soviet Central Asia, along roads and railways running across Afghanistan. He believed that stability in Afghanistan would mean a potential economic bonanza for Pakistan and a strategic breakthrough for the West.

""It was in the West's overall interest,"" he said in an interview in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. ""Unless the Central Asian states have an opening to the sea, they will never be free from Russia.""

With the rise of Taliban power around Kandahar, Babar spied a chance to prove the vision's practicability. Using Pakistani government funds, he arranged a ""peace convoy"" of heavily loaded trucks to run rice, clothing and other gifts north from Quetta in Pakistan, through Kandahar, and onward to Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenistan.

But outside the American-built airport at Kandahar, a mujahedeen commander guarding one of the thousands of checkpoints that had made an obstacle course of any Afghan journey seized the convoy, demanding ransom. Once again, the Taliban intervened, freeing the convoy and hanging, again from a tank barrel, the commander who hijacked it.

Babar's subsequent enthusiasm for the Taliban gave rise to a widespread belief among the the group's opponents that it was a Pakistani creation, or at least that its growing military power was sustained by large transfers of cash, arms and ammunition from Pakistan. Because of Pakistan's close ties with the United States, it was a short step for these Taliban opponents to conclude that Washington was also backing the Taliban.

After Kabul fell in September, Americans venturing into non-Taliban areas north of Kabul faced a common taunt from soldiers of the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. ""The Taliban are American puppets!"" they said.

But while this was not accurate, there were ties between American officials and the growing movement that were considerably broader than those to any other Western country.

From early on, American diplomats in Islamabad had made regular visits to Kandahar to see Taliban leaders. In briefings for reporters, these diplomats cited what they saw as positive aspects of the Taliban, which they listed as the movement's capacity to end the war in Afghanistan and its promises to put an end to the use of Afghanistan as a base for narcotics-trafficking and international terrorism.

Unmentioned, but probably most important to Washington, was that the Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, have a deep hostility for Iran, America's nemesis, where the ruling majority belong to the rival Shiite sect of Islam.

Along the way, Washington developed yet another interest in the Taliban as potential backers for a 1,200-mile gas pipeline that an American energy company, Union Oil of California, has proposed building from Quetta, in Pakistan, to Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic that sits atop some of the world's largest gas reserves, but has limited means to export them.

The project, which Unocal executives have estimated could cost $5 billion, would be built in conjunction with Delta Oil Co., a Saudi Arabian concern that also has close links to the Taliban. Among the advisers Unocal has employed to deal with the Taliban is Robert Oakley, a former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.

American officials, however, denied providing any direct assistance, covert or otherwise, to the Taliban.

Similar assurances were given to Russia and India, as well as indirectly to Iran, countries that were involved in heavy arms shipments of their own to the Taliban's main opponents, the armies of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and Rabbani that control the 12 northern provinces that continue to resist the Taliban.

""We do not have any relationship with the Taliban, and we never have had,"" David Cohen, the CIA official who directs the agency's clandestine operations, told Indian officials in New Delhi in November.

Babar offered similar denials, asserting that ""there has been no financial or material aid to the Taliban from Pakistan."" But Western intelligence officials in Pakistan said this was a smokescreen for a policy of covert support that Babar, a retired Pakistani general, had extended to the Taliban after the convoy episode at Kandahar airport.

These supplies, the intelligence officials said, apart from ammunition and fuel, included the deployment at crucial junctures of Pakistani military advisers. The advisers were easy to hide, since they were almost all ethnic Pashtuns, from the same tribe that make up the overwhelming majority of the Taliban.

American officials like Robin Raphel, the top State Department official dealing directly with matters involving Afghanistan, have placed heavy emphasis on the hope that contacts with the new rulers in Kabul will encourage them to soften their policies, especially toward women.

They also say that the United States sees the Taliban, with its Islamic conservatism, as the best, and perhaps the only, chance that Afghanistan will halt the poppy growing and opium production that have made Afghanistan, with an estimated 2,500 tons of raw opium a year, the world's biggest single-country source of the narcotic. A similar argument is made on the issue of the network of international terrorists, many of them Arabs, who have set up bases inside Afghanistan.

But as the Taliban consolidate their power in Kabul, the signs of cooperation are not strong. In the week before Christmas, as bitterly cold winds from the 20,000-foot Hindu Kush mountains swept down on Kabul, senior Taliban officials seemed to be in a more pugnacious mood than in October, when a counteroffensive by the Rabbani and Dostum forces came within 10 miles of Kabul.

The attacking forces have since been driven back beyond artillery range, allowing the Taliban to concentrate on tightening their grip on Kabul's restive population of 1.5-million.

The sense that these Taliban leaders now give is that they see little reason to accommodate the West. Reports from U.N. officials monitoring drug flows suggest the Taliban have done nothing to impede the trafficking, and that in the key provinces of Helmand and Nangahar -- accounting for more than 90 percent of the opium production -- they are in league with the drug producers, taxing them, and storing some of the opium in Taliban-guarded warehouses.

Confronted with these reports, Taliban leaders have a stock response. ""We intend to stop the drug trafficking, because it is against Islamic laws,"" they have said. ""But until we can rebuild our economy, there are no other jobs, so now is not the time.""

The Taliban position on those who support international terrorists is still more elusive. According to Western intelligence estimates, as many as 400 trained terrorists are living in areas under Taliban control, some of them with links to the groups that mounted the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993 as well as other major attacks.

One of the most-wanted terrorists of all, Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian businessman who praised the bombing last December that killed 19 American servicemen at an air force barracks in the Saudi Arabian city of Dahran, has been spotted within the past month at a heavily-guarded home in the Afghan city of Jalalabad, held by the Taliban since early September.

But it is on their treatment of women that Western governments' attitudes seem most likely to hinge, and on this, the Taliban show no sign of relenting. After a Taliban radio bulletin earlier this month celebrated the fact that 250 Kabul women had been beaten by Taliban forces in a single day for not observing the dress code, Ross Everson, an Australian working as a coordinator for private Western aid agencies in Kabul, visited one of the city's top Taliban officials, Mullah Mohammed Mutaqi, to appeal for a turn toward what Everson called ""the doctrine of moderation that the Islamic faith is famous for.""

Mutaqi stood up and waved his fist in Everson's face. ""You are insulting us!,"" he said. Then, snuggling back into the blanket that Taliban officials wear around their shoulders for warmth in the unheated offices of Kabul, he made his clinching argument.

""I must ask you, are you the Muslim here, or am I?,"" he said. ""If you westerners want to help us, you are welcome. Otherwise you are free to leave Afghanistan. You may think we cannot survive without you, but I can tell you, God will provide the Taliban with everything we need."""
26,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"Just days before he was detained on charges of collaborating with drug traffickers, the head of Mexico's antinarcotics program was given detailed briefings on what the United States knows about Mexico's cocaine cartels, Administration officials disclosed today.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had begun an immediate ''damage assessment'' to determine if secret information had been compromised or if United States drug informants have been placed in danger. One Administration official said tonight that the briefings had included ''really sensitive stuff.''

Another Administration official said the United States was especially concerned about possible threats to the informants who provided information to American drug and intelligence officers.

''If the information about them is closely held and only four people know about it, the way they work down there, they'll kill all four people,'' this official said.

American officials also said they feared that some ongoing operations intended to catch major Mexican cartel leaders might have been compromised.

''We're going to Plan B,'' one official said. ''You always have a contingency plan. You don't put all your eggs in one basket.''

American officials acknowledged they had no early warning that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the former commissioner of the National Institute to Combat Drugs, was under suspicion of doing business with one of Mexico's most powerful drug lords.

Mexican authorities confronted General Gutierrez with the accusations against him, forced his resignation and detained him on Feb. 6, but American officials said they did not learn of the charges until Tuesday, when they were announced by the Mexican authorities.

''This points to a major intelligence community failure,'' one American official said. ''He was detained since Feb. 6 and we didn't know it. We had no idea.''

At a news conference on Tuesday night, Defense Minister Enrique Cervantes Aguirre disclosed that General Gutierrez had received gifts, payments and real estate from the cartel controlled by Amado Carrillo Fuentes, one of Mexico's most ruthless and aggressive drug lords, and had provided protection to cocaine shipments for as long as seven years.

General Gutierrez, along with two of his top aides, was remanded today to a maximum security prison near Mexico City to face charges of racketeering and aiding the traffic of cocaine, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said.

The general will also face a court-martial at which, top military commanders have suggested, he may be tried for treason.

The events leave Mexico's antidrug program in disarray only two weeks before President Clinton is expected to certify to Congress that Mexico is making significant strides in its drug effort.

As head of a special closed agency set up in 1993 to insulate drug operations from the corruption of the civilian police, General Gutierrez was privy to Mexico's most secret counter-narcotics operations and had access to the most confidential intelligence Mexico has gathered about its cartels.

General Gutierrez traveled to Washington in late January with Attorney General Madrazo to discuss the transfer of American helicopters to Mexico for counter-narcotics operations.

General Gutierrez was treated to closed briefings by White House, Drug Enforcement Administration and intelligence officials, Administration officials said.

One official said the Clinton Administration is now trying to determine ''what we gave them, what format it took, whether a source could be identified by the way we shared the information or if methods were exposed.''

The arrest on drug charges of the officer who had been named only two months earlier to lead the drug agency left United States officials wondering who in Mexico, if anyone, could be trusted to carry on the fight against a flood of narcotics flowing from Colombia across the border into the United States.

Mexican leaders, struggling to be optimistic, cited the general's arrest as an example of President Ernesto Zedillo's determination to combat narcotics traffickers even at the risk of exposing top-level officials.

Armed forces commanders, however, made it clear they are convinced that General Gutierrez took part in a long-term scheme to enrich himself by working with the Carrillo Fuentes operation, believed to be the dominant cartel in Mexico.

The news conference that Defense Minister Cervantes gave on Tuesday night to announce the the general's detention was his first. He summoned every senior commander in the armed forces to the Defense Ministry auditorium to hear that military investigators had discovered that General Gutierrez received payoffs, vehicles and even an apartment from Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.

In an unusually emotional speech today to top commanders, General Cervantes called General Gutierrez a ''bad soldier'' who ''betrayed all the values'' of Mexico. He called the arrest a ''severe blow'' to the armed forces but insisted that the military would not be ''tempted to conceal'' the general's alleged crimes.

Extensive security measures surrounded the detention of General Gutierrez. The military inquiry began not long after he took over as drug czar and moved into a stylish apartment in Mexico City that Mexican officials said was obviously more than he could afford on his public salary.

The Defense Minister said that when he confronted General Gutierrez on Feb. 6. the general suffered a ''an important physical alteration'' and was hospitalized under detention.

Even in good times the United States has difficulty obtaining information from Mexico's armed forces, which still regard the giant neighbor to the north as part friend and part adversary. But President Zedillo adopted a policy of cooperating with the United States against drugs, while he moved military officers increasingly into positions of responsibility in narcotics agencies in an effort to circumvent the notoriously corrupt and inefficient civilian police.

American officials believed the information-sharing was improving.

General Gutierrez's downfall is especially problematical for the White House Drug coordinator, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who had publicly lauded the Mexican's integrity and patriotism.

General Gutierrez was named to the drug post by President Zedillo on Dec. 6, 1996. General Cervantes acknowleged that he personally recommended the general for the job because of the officer's record of tough measures against some of the major drug dealers in the central Mexican region where he served as commander for seven years.

But military investigators learned that General Gutierrez's Mexico City apartment was provided to him by one of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes' highest lieutenants. Using wiretaps, the investigators gathered evidence that top aides to the general had received large payoffs in dollars as well as vehicles and special encrypting devices from the Carrillo Fuentes organization.

An aide to General Gutierrez, Horacio Montenegro Ortiz, was accused of carrying out a kidnapping in September 1996 whose victim has never reappeared and is presumed dead. The armed forces also accused General Gutierrez of harboring army desertors and profiting from contraband operations in clothing and other goods besides drugs.

In an ingenious scheme, Mexican officials said, General Gutierrez protected his reputation as an effective anti-narcotics officer by attacking some drug organizations while working secretly with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes."
27,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"The Governor of the Mexican state that borders Arizona is collaborating with one of the world's most powerful drug traffickers, creating a haven for smugglers who transport vast quantities of narcotics into the United States, according to American officials and intelligence.

Officials said this conclusion was based on a wealth of evidence, including ''highly reliable'' informers' reports that the Governor, Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera, took part in meetings in which leading traffickers paid high-level politicians who were protecting their operations.

According to the accounts, Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of the former President, received suitcases full of cash and was responsible for distributing the money to those attending.

Present and former officials said the evidence of Mr. Beltrones's role was so detailed and compelling that the United States had included his name on a confidential document provided to the transition team of President Ernesto Zedillo listing more than a dozen officials suspected of corruption. Another Mexican Governor, Jorge Carrillo Olea, was also included on the American blacklist because of reported entanglements with major drug dealers.

While Mr. Zedillo did not name either man to a federal post, both continue to wield considerable power in their states and nationally through their prominence in Mexico's governing party. Both seem to enjoy a tacit immunity from concerted criminal investigation in Mexico and the United States.

Although Mexican governors are popularly elected, presidents have the power in practice to force their removal.

Mr. Beltrones, in an interview, denied any links to drug traffickers and disputed American law enforcement officials' assertions that Amado Carrillo Fuentes, one of Mexico's most wanted drug kingpins, was operating with impunity in his state, Sonora. In addition, Mr. Carrillo Olea, who presides over Morelos, the state just south of Mexico City, disputed charges that he had cooperated with traffickers.

In a four-month investigation that draws on intelligence documents and interviews in the United States and Mexico, The New York Times examined how both Governments handled the allegations against the two Governors.

The result is a picture of official frustration on both sides of the border and, several officials asserted, a case study of why traffickers' political patrons often go unpunished.

Despite the recent disclosures about official corruption, American officials say the Clinton Administration is planning to certify later this month that Mexico is cooperating with anti-drug efforts.

Senior Administration officials say that decision reflects a belief that Mexico's leadership is doing all it can against staggering odds.

But many law enforcement officials say it also shows that the Clinton Administration considers the narcotics fight less important than fostering commerce with this country's third-largest trading partner. Thus, these officials assert, intelligence reports suggesting corruption among Mexican politicians like Mr. Beltrones receive little attention in Washington. Similarly, agents working in Mexico feel they will get little support if they scrutinize the activities of powerful Mexican officials.

President Clinton praised Mexico last week for arresting the head of its anti-narcotics program on drug charges, citing the act as evidence that corruption, even ''at the highest levels,'' was not being tolerated.

Privately, however, American officials acknowledge that Mexican traffickers' political patrons are seldom the targets of law enforcement officials in either country, even though they play an important role in the drug trade.

In a previously undisclosed draft analysis, intelligence officials assert that Mexican traffickers take in as much as $10 billion annually, then spend as much as 60 percent of that money on bribes for officials at all levels. Officials say much of the derogatory information about Mr. Beltrones and Mr. Carrillo Olea, a former director of Mexico's anti-narcotics program, has been gathered through intelligence reports from informers, ranging from inside accounts to raw gossip. Their volume, specificity and persistence over time have persuaded many American officials that the allegations against the Governors are well founded.

But officials said such material was of little use to prosecutors, who build their cases around witnesses willing to testify in American courts.

In addition, American law enforcement officials acknowledge a reluctance to invest time and money in pursuing corrupt foreign officials.

The Protection Racket: Word May Be Out, But Proof Is Lacking
''In Mexico,'' said one American prosecutor in a border state, ''political protection is difficult to prove. If we could prove it, we'd have them all under indictment. There's a big difference between knowing something and proving it in a court of law.

''You have extremely reliable intelligence sources, but unless you can prove it, why burn your sources? You'd have their body parts spread all over Sonora.''

Mr. Beltrones, for his part, says the reports collected by American intelligence and drug agents were fabricated by political rivals. ''This sounds like a novel, filled with horror and error,'' he said. ''At what time of the day do I govern, if I'm spending my time on all these crimes?''

Wilburn Sears, a veteran agent with bulging forearms and a walrus mustache, took charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's five-person office in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora, in 1991. He soon came to the realization that the state was overrun by traffickers.

Mexico's second-largest state in size, Sonora was ideal terrain for smugglers, a sprawling region of cattle ranches and desert landing strips etched with rail lines and lonely roads leading north to more than 300 miles of remote border.

Vast quantities of marijuana were pouring up the highways. Passenger cars were ferrying methamphetamines over the line into Arizona. And the traffickers were traveling in and out of Hermosillo and other Sonoran cities in long convoys or in private jets, under the noses of state and federal police officers.

''The feds were protecting the airports,'' Mr. Sears said in a recent interview. ''They were doing everything out there except kick-starting the narcos' airplanes.''

It was in those years that Mr. Carrillo Fuentes began the ascent that would make him one of Mexico's shrewdest and most influential drug smugglers. The nephew of one of the country's narcotics pioneers, he had been building his organization in the late 1980's, wooing marijuana farmers to the south in Sinaloa, the heroin clans of Durango and especially the cocaine barons of Cali, Colombia. Most of all, he had cultivated the skills of Mexican narcotics diplomacy and knew what it took to buy protection from powerful politicians.

In a lengthy 1994 study, the Drug Enforcement Administration's analysts in El Paso, Texas, painted a detailed picture of how Mr. Carrillo Fuentes cultivated Mexican police officials and political leaders, including Mr. Beltrones and Mr. Carrillo Olea. According to the classified analysis, based on field reports from more than a dozen American agencies, the trafficker has ''purchased influence at various key levels in the Mexican Government,'' giving him ''powerful connections'' that insure safe passage of his drug loads through Mexico to the United States.

A Political Operator: Showing Potential For a Rapid Rise
In the early 1990's, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes was moving to make Hermosillo a strategic staging area, American officials said. He was living in a pink stucco mansion down the street from the American consul's residence in a palm-fringed neighborhood. He had begun construction of a much more extravagant, onion-domed house -- locals called it a Thousand and One Nights -- a few blocks north. And among other properties he or his associates had acquired was a communications center across town.

In August 1991 Mr. Beltrones was elected, and in October he moved into the colonial-style governor's palace in Hermosillo. He was a rising star in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, one of a handful of ambitious 40-something leaders sometimes called the ''babysaurs,'' to distinguish them from the older ''dinosaurs'' who have long ruled the party. During his early career, Mr. Beltrones had been the understudy to Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Mr. Salinas's Interior Minister and one of the pioneers of Mexico's secret police. Some have seen Mr. Beltrones as a possible presidential candidate.

But about the time that he took the oath of office, United States officials began picking up reports from confidential informers documenting his ties to Mr. Carrillo Fuentes. In an interview, Mr. Beltrones raised his voice when reporters described D.E.A. reports alleging that he had accepted payments from Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.

''These reports are incredible in every sense, filled with fantasy and lies,'' Mr. Beltrones said. The D.E.A., he added, ''is completely out of focus.''

As evidence of his hostility to drug trafficking, Mr. Beltrones asserted that he had virtually driven Mr. Carrillo Fuentes from Hermosillo.

A high-ranking Mexican official said that Mr. Beltrones learned of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's residences in Hermosillo shortly after he took office. Months later, the official said, Mr. Beltrones ordered aides to videotape Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's arrival at the local airport in a Lear jet, and his travels about the state capital in a convoy guarded by police vehicles. The Governor delivered the tape to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the official added, and federal authorities later confiscated four of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's properties, including the onion-domed mansion.

''How would the D.E.A. explain that I'm the one who took away this man's houses?'' Mr. Beltrones asked.

American officials and reports acknowledge that four of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's Hermosillo houses were seized. But they said his organization continued to use at least eight other properties, including the communications center. The officials maintain that Sonora remains one of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's most important operating bases.

In the early 1990's, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes set out to increase his air smuggling operations, and for that he needed help at the highest levels of the federal bureaucracy. Under Mexican law the federal government enforces the drug statutes.

At the time, Mexican authorities were working with their American counterparts to perfect a radar network that tracked aircraft flying north from Colombia. The system allowed controllers to follow unidentified planes on a wall-sized screen in Mexico City and to scramble interceptor aircraft if the planes entered Mexico.

Mr. Carrillo Olea, a former army general whom President Salinas appointed to oversee the drug intelligence center created with American help, was in charge of the radar system. American officials spoke highly of him, and many reacted with disbelief to the first intelligence reports that he was helping the traffickers.

But by 1992, additional reports persuaded analysts at El Paso's intelligence center that Mr. Carrillo Olea was helping Mr. Carrillo Fuentes. (The two are not related.)

As one intelligence document reads: ''Reporting from 1992 indicates that the former Mexican coordinator against narcotics trafficking, Jorge Carrillo Olea, was at that time Amado Carrillo Fuentes's most influential associate in the Mexican Government. Carrillo Olea was in charge of controlling the radar detection in Mexico, and by utilizing the information provided to him, he was able to insure safe passage of Carrillo Fuentes's aircraft.''

In an interview last week, Mr. Carrillo Olea, now Governor of Morelos, called these accounts ''a complete barbarity.''

''What can I say about a thing like this,'' he asked ''except that it is a rotund and absolute lie?It has no foundation whatever.''

American officials say that reports about Mr. Beltrones's drug activities have come from nearly two dozen sources inside the Mexican Government and its law enforcement agencies.

The 1994 D.E.A. study of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes described how his smuggling organization, identified by his initials, A.C.F., expanded ''full force'' into Sonora.

''Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera is well documented as being associated with the A.C.F. organization,'' the report reads. It quotes a commander of the Federal Judicial Police as stating that Mr. Beltrones is ''involved in protecting drug traffickers passing through Sonora.''

In 1994, Mr. Sears searched D.E.A.'s computerized intelligence files and found numerous references to Mr. Beltrones and members of his family, according to a memo Mr. Sears wrote. ''The Governor,'' the document noted, is mentioned in cases ''from San Diego to Tucson.''

A Source Network: Informers Describe Meetings and Money
Among the most persuasive intelligence reports, officials said, are accounts of regular meetings at a ranch in which Mexico's most notorious traffickers gave cash to Raul Salinas, who in turn distributed it to the senior politicians present.

Mr. Salinas, whose brother was President of Mexico at the time, is now awaiting trial in Mexico City on charges of murder and financial wrongdoing, and investigators have found more than $100 million in his overseas bank accounts. He maintains that his fortune has legitimate sources.

Mr. Beltrones was said to have attended three meetings at the ranch from 1990 to 1993, and the officials said Mr. Carrillo Fuentes was present for at least one.

In August 1994, the State Department sent William Francisco, a former Army infantry officer, to serve as the senior diplomat at the American Consulate in Hermosillo.

Almost immediately he trained his sights on the Governor, raising questions about the reports of corruption and misconduct, which were being ignored by other American officials.

Mr. Sears and his D.E.A. staff in Hermosillo were busy trying to keep track of the five major mafias operating all across northwest Mexico. They spent much of their time traveling between Hermosillo and the distant border gateways of Tijuana or Ciudad Juarez.

''They gave me a new car,'' Mr. Sears said, ''and I put 35,000 miles on it in seven months. We were just keeping our heads above water. There were so many reports of corruption about everybody that most of the time we didn't even write it up. We just had to accept the fact that corruption exists.''

In Pursuit: An American Consul Seen as Overzealous
Mr. Francisco felt otherwise.

Shortly after his arrival, he received a briefing from Mr. Sears about the major Mexican traffickers and studied the intelligence report naming Mr. Beltrones as an associate of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.

Then, Mr. Sears recalled, Mr. Francisco traveled south to the state of Sinaloa and came back with new reports about the pervasive influence of traffickers. At his request, Mr. Sears checked D.E.A.'s computerized intelligence files and found extensive references to Mr. Beltrones.

In an unusual step for a State Department official assigned to an obscure consulate, Mr. Francisco began recruiting his own sources about the drug trade and Mr. Beltrones's role in it.

When Mr. Francisco heard a report that Mr. Beltrones was being considered for a post in President Zedillo's Cabinet as head of Mexico's powerful Interior Ministry, he grew downright alarmed.

On Nov. 15, 1994, after just 12 weeks as consul, he stalked into his office and fired off an urgent cable to the embassy in Mexico City.

''Request for assistance to verify and further develop info of allegations of extensive criminal activities by Son. Gov. Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera, who may be under consideration to become the next Secretary of Gobernacion,'' Mr. Francisco headlined his dispatch, using the Spanish term for Mexico's Interior Ministry.

Mr. Francisco complained that the D.E.A. and customs agents in Hermosillo were too preoccupied with minor traffickers and should instead pursue political figures like Mr. Beltrones, whom he termed ''a truly major kingpin player.''

His cable -- which mixed drug intelligence with lurid tales about the personal lives of Sonoran officials -- stunned Mr. Sears and officials at the embassy in Mexico City. Although Mr. Francisco had no direct or specific evidence to document his allegations, he called for a criminal investigation that could lead to Mr. Beltrones's indictment in the United States.

The cable reached the desk of the American Ambassador, James R. Jones, and American officials said he viewed it skeptically. Mr. Jones was instinctively cautious about the reliability of law enforcement intelligence reports. In addition, several officials said, the criminal investigation of a foreign official poses daunting political and practical difficulties.

Collecting intelligence on an official like Mr. Beltrones is one thing. But several officials said that building a criminal case against him -- linking him to specific drug shipments or conspiracies that violate American law -- would be quite another.

Informers willing to whisper an allegation under cloak of confidentiality would have to be persuaded to travel to the United States to testify before a grand jury, and perhaps later at a public trial. That would endanger not only their careers but their lives.

Even if all these difficulties were overcome, the accused official would have to be extradited to the United States for trial. Mexico has never before extradited a Mexican citizen accused of narcotics trafficking. (Juan Garcia Abrego, a Mexican trafficker, was expelled to the United States a year ago, not extradited, and he holds American citizenship.)

''Indicting a public official of a foreign government is cumbersome to say the least,'' the official said. ''And then getting them out of Mexico -- it never happens.''

Mr. Francisco's recommendation was never seriously considered by the embassy's top officials. Virtually everyone there reportedly regarded it as quixotic, even ''goofy,'' as one put it. In fact, officials said, the idea of launching an American criminal inquiry into Mr. Beltrones's dealings was not raised with senior officials in Washington.

A Revelation: List of Suspects For Mexico's Leader
As it happened, Mr. Zedillo and his advisers, preparing to take office on Dec. 1, 1994, had already given American officials a less public means of dealing with allegations involving officials like Mr. Beltrones.

''The Zedillo administration wanted names of people believed to be corrupt, or possibly in the pay of traffickers, whom the United States would not like to see in the new Government,'' a former American official said.

Mr. Jones gave Mr. Zedillo's transition team a list of about 15 current and former Mexican officials. It included Mr. Beltrones and Mr. Carrillo Olea, three officials said.

A senior Mexican official said in an interview that neither Mr. Beltrones nor any other of Mexico's 31 active governors was ever considered for a post in Mr. Zedillo's Cabinet. The Zedillo Government apparently has never followed up on the American warning by investigating either Governor.

But embassy officials felt that delivery of the list had shifted all responsibility onto Mexican authorities, where it belonged.

Early in 1995 the embassy's No. 2 official, David Beall, telephoned Mr. Francisco and lectured him about the cables he had written, American officials said. Mr Francisco interpreted the call in subsequent conversations with associates as an order to stop reporting on the Governor.

A senior American official denied that. ''He may have been told, 'For your own safety and for the integrity of what law enforcement is trying to do, don't be a cowboy,' '' the official said. ''But he was not muzzled.''

Still, if he stopped filing cables, Mr. Francisco continued to voice suspicions about Mr. Beltrones's activities. He even shared his opinions of the Governor with Nicolas Escalante Barrett, Mexico's consul general in Phoenix, who reported the incident to the Mexican Foreign Ministry. American officials and Mr. Beltrones said they believed that the Foreign Ministry complained to the American Government about Mr. Francisco's conduct.

In September 1995, Mr. Francisco was transferred to Frankfurt. He declined to be interviewed for this article.

One senior American official insisted that Mr. Francisco's transfer was a ''routine rotation.''

Others disagreed. ''He was a loose cannon,'' an official said. ''He was probably going to get himself killed if we didn't get him out of there.''

Mr. Carrillo Fuentes has continued to consolidate power. His success at sending cocaine-laden aircraft undetected into Mexican airspace and his largess have led Mexicans to nickname him Lord of the Heavens.

In January, Mexican troops stormed a ranch in Sinaloa during a wedding reception for Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's sister, hoping to capture him. But word leaked, and he slipped away. In the days that followed, authorities acknowledged that three private jets, operating without flight plans, had ferried wedding guests to Sinaloa from the airport in Cuernavaca, the capital of Morelos state, where Mr. Carrillo Olea is Governor.

American narcotics officials say that Mr. Carrillo Fuentes has been living in Morelos, where he owns many properties, and that his fleet of narcotics jets frequently lands and takes off unchallenged from the Cuernavaca airport. Mr. Carrillo Olea said in an interview that his aides had traced ownership of all residences identified as belonging to the trafficker, without finding his name. Any further investigation, he said, is the responsibility of federal authorities.

Mr. Beltrones is wrapping up his six-year term as one of Mexico's more popular governors. He is working closely with Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona on a plan to improve cross-border commerce and investment. Recent developments have left Mexico's anti-narcotics program in chaos.

The commander of January's failed wedding raid was Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, then the national anti-narcotics coordinator. He was arrested last week and accused of having accepted payments from Mr. Carrillo Fuentes for seven years, ever since he was put in a command post in the anti-drug program.

Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's capture was intended as a dramatic symbol of progress in the drug war weeks before March 1. By that deadline annually, President Clinton certifies that drug transiting or producing nations are pursuing serious anti-drug efforts. Instead, the trafficker is still at large and still spending his billions.

''Money corrupts,'' said Doug Wankel, who just retired as D.E.A. operations chief, ''and in Mexico it's getting to the point where the traffickers can corrupt absolutely.''"
28,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"The owner of a department store in the provincial capital of Culiacan was driving to work one morning last September when three unmarked sedans without license plates surrounded his gray Oldsmobile.

As passers-by watched in terror, four men brandishing assault rifles hauled the man, Romulo Rico Urrea, from his car, forced him into one of theirs and sped away.

Mr. Rico has not been seen since Sept. 25, 1996. But a notebook dropped in his car by one of the kidnappers, as well as evidence gathered by military investigators, links the abduction to Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the former head of Mexico's anti-drug agency who was arrested last month on charges of collaborating with one of the country's most powerful cocaine barons.

Mr. Rico is one of at least 51 Mexicans who have disappeared in the last three years after kidnappings in which there were signs of Government security force involvement, according to lists compiled by relatives, human rights organizations and the press. Now, evidence is emerging to tie many of the abductions to the war against powerful drug traffickers, which has increasingly been under the command of Mexico's military.

''We are everyday citizens under attack, caught in the crossfire between narcos, authorities and narco-authorities,'' said Lucia Solis de Jurado, whose husband, a semiprecious-stone trader from the border city of Ciudad Juarez, was seized on the front step of his home on Oct. 6, 1996. ''It has gotten to the point where it can happen to anyone.''

A majority of the victims have no proven ties to drug traffickers or other criminal activities, relatives and human rights leaders contend, although a number have had brushes with the authorities.

''They tend to be businessmen, students and other citizens who were going about their lives,'' said Oscar Loza of the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in the state of Sinaloa, where at least nine people have disappeared.

Mexico's military has traditionally played a supporting role in the fight against drug trafficking, mainly eradicating narcotics crops. Shortly after he took office in 1994, President Ernesto Zedillo, facing widespread corruption in the state and federal police, began to place military officers and troops in key positions in the battle against the drug cartels.

General Gutierrez was appointed Mexico's chief anti-drug official in December 1996, and army officers were given command of state and municipal police forces in Sinaloa, through which large quantities of drugs flow. Just last week, the army took over narcotics operations in the border state of Baja California.

A Growing Concern Over the Military's Role
Since the arrest of General Gutierrez, who was highly decorated, a number of families of missing Mexicans have come forward after enduring their anguish in silence for months and even years. The number of known victims is growing.

There is evidence that in addition to Mr. Rico, five men who disappeared since last September in northern Mexico were abducted in operations commanded by General Gutierrez and carried out by his deputies during his two-month tenure as head of the national drug agency or before that, when he was the senior commander of the Fifth Military Region in central Mexico.

The abductions in which General Gutierrez appears to have had a role are only a fraction of those reported. The general's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.

The disclosures about the kidnappings raise new questions about General Gutierrez's ascent to the highest position in Mexico's war on drugs, and about Mr. Zedillo's moves to expand the role of the armed forces in the anti-narcotics campaign.

Several months before Defense Minister Enrique Cervantes Aguirre recommended General Gutierrez to the President for the top anti-drug job, the Mexican military had substantial evidence implicating the general's two closest aides in the kidnapping of Mr. Rico. Both aides were arrested with their commander on drug charges on Feb. 18.

The kidnapping allegations apparently never reached the highest levels. Mr. Cervantes acknowledged that neither he nor President Zedillo had had any doubts about General Gutierrez until about two weeks before his arrest.

Mr. Rico's relatives say they believe that he came under suspicion of drug trafficking because Miguel Angel Rico Urrea, his brother, was falsely accused on drug charges in 1992 and served prison time before he was cleared. A judge ordered his release, but the day he was to leave prison he was murdered.

Notebook Scribblings Reveal a Date and Place 
On Sept. 16, 1996, soldiers in Culiacan swarmed into the home of Enrique Rico, another brother. The raid, conducted without a warrant, was led by a brash officer who identified himself with a name that later proved false. Romulo Rico was seized nine days later. At first, federal police agents told his relatives he was in custody at their headquarters.

But 24 hours later the same agents denied they had ever seen him, relatives said. At about the same time, Mr. Rico's wife of 33 years, Teresa, received an anonymous telephone call from a man who said her husband had been detained by someone named Horacio Montenegro Ortiz. The caller said he had seen Mr. Montenegro escorting his prisoner onto a military plane at the local airport.

The family did not recognize the name at the time, but it turned out to be significant. Mr. Montenegro, a former army captain, had long worked closely with General Gutierrez.

Later that day Mr. Rico's family discovered a notebook that one of his abductors had accidentally dropped between the front seats of his car. The scribbled, sometimes encoded phrases showed that the writer was a military officer who was in Sinaloa pursuing an inquiry into the murder in Mexico City on Sept. 14 of a leading anti-narcotics police commander, Ernesto Ibarra Santes.

The huge operation to find and capture Mr. Ibarra's killers was commanded by General Gutierrez, senior army commanders recently confirmed.

Unlike many families of the disappeared, the Ricos did not remain silent. They took the notebook to military and police authorities and human rights groups in the state and the capital, raising questions about the mysterious Mr. Montenegro.

In October, shortly before General Gutierrez was appointed commissioner of the National Institute to Combat Drugs, more than a hundred federal legislators signed a petition calling for a deeper investigation into Mr. Rico's kidnapping. And the military told the family that it was opening its own inquiry.

One man who took up the case was a newly appointed Attorney General, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, a former human rights lawyer. But the Federal Judicial Police under his command steadfastly denied knowing anything about Mr. Rico, Mr. Madrazo said in an interview.

So he sent the Rico family to General Gutierrez, recently appointed to the drug agency at the time, thinking he was ''the right man to conduct the investigation.''

''We were surprised at how pleasant and friendly the general was,'' Mrs. Rico said bitterly in an interview. ''I thought I had finally found the person who was going to give me back my husband.''

In 10 meetings with her, Mrs. Rico said, General Gutierrez never acknowledged that he had directed the operations in Sinaloa at the time of her husband's kidnapping or that Mr. Montenegro had become his deputy in the drug institute, where the conversations took place.

As the Evidence Grows, Families Share Sorrows 
Defense Minister Cervantes confirmed in a speech on Feb. 18 that Mr. Montenegro, ''a man with a disastrous reputation,'' was under military investigation for the Rico kidnapping. He added that last year General Gutierrez had disobeyed ''explicit orders'' from the high command to dissociate himself from Mr. Montenegro.

Another piece of evidence linking General Gutierrez to the kidnapping became clear after his arrest. Mexican television broadcast film of Capt. Javier Garcia Hernandez, an army intelligence officer and aide to General Gutierrez who was arrested on drug charges the same day as his commander.

Relatives who had witnessed the raid at Enrique Rico's home said they recognized Captain Hernandez as the brash officer who had commanded the search. In late February, military officials told the Rico family confidentially that the notebook in Romulo Rico's car belonged to Captain Hernandez.

In recent days, a half-dozen northern Mexican families, with nine disappeared relatives among them, have come together for somber meetings in the cramped Mexico City apartment where Teresa Rico and her children have taken refuge. They found one another through human rights organizations they had approached after General Gutierrez's arrest.

As they sadly share photographs of missing loved ones, they worry about their own safety. Human rights activists who helped them have received death threats, apparently to stop their publicizing disappearance cases. In interviews the activists confirmed the threats and asked not to be identified.

Gilberto Chaidez, the 22-year-old nephew of two hoteliers who were abducted from the border city of Tijuana, said he had broken down as he watched the televised announcement of General Gutierrez's arrest. Mr. Chaidez, a burly man with a buzz cut, had to stop to control his sorrow once again last week when he recalled his reactions.

''We were sure those men participated in kidnapping my uncles,'' Mr. Chaidez said. ''We thought it meant they would finally be released.''

Some Official Routes That Lead Nowhere 
Rogelio Verber Mondaca, 39, is the father of two men who were kidnapped by uniformed army troops from a highway south of Tijuana on Jan. 6. Mr. Verber, who until a few years ago was the Deputy Police Chief of Tijuana, called on his friends in local law enforcement to help him mount a statewide search for his sons Rogelio and Raul, to no avail.

His son Rogelio, 28, suffers from advanced Hodgkin's disease and has a catheter in his heart for treatment, Mr. Verber said. He produced news photographs and clippings showing that General Gutierrez was conducting anti-drug operations in the area at the time his sons disappeared.

Mrs. Jurado and her family have become outraged about the official response to their quest for her husband, Ruben Guillermo Jurado, 39. A senior official of the state of Chihuahua, where the Jurados live, confirmed in an interview this week that Mr. Jurado had been seized by armed men wearing federal drug police uniforms.

Nevertheless the official, who insisted on anonymity, said state investigators believed that Mr. Jurado might have been kidnapped by drug traffickers, because of ''narcotics-related wrapping materials'' found in his home.

The Jurado family indignantly accused the authorities of inventing charges against Mr. Jurado. They point out that the police never searched his residence or workshop, before or since he disappeared.

Some relatives have nearly despaired of going through Mexican institutions. Maria de los Angeles de Beltran, whose husband, Manuel, disappeared in 1994, wrote to the United States Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, pleading for help.

''Our Government doesn't fight drug trafficking,'' Mrs. Beltran wrote angrily. ''It just administers it.''"
29,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"Some of Mexico's most prominent anti-drug operations of the past year were undertaken at the behest of Mexico's biggest drug baron, who had enlisted corrupt generals in his war against a competitor, military officers have testified in secret court proceedings here.

The testimony, which came in parallel court-martial and criminal inquiries, shows how drug corruption has spread more widely through Mexico than previously thought, and offers a richly detailed account of how traffickers have undertaken to suborn even Mexico's highest-ranking leaders.

The testimony also raises questions about efforts by the Mexican and American Governments to rely on the military in the fight against drugs rather than on the police, which have already been tainted by corruption.

The new details are part of the case against Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, who was arrested in February on corruption charges.

According to an 1,100-page record of the proceedings, at least 14 army captains, lieutenants and noncommissioned officers are cooperating with military and civilian prosecutors in their cases against General Gutierrez.

The officers testified that many of the manhunts, house-to-house searches and other efforts hailed by the Government as evidence of its cooperation in the war on drugs were collaborative ventures.

Units of the Mexican military, they said, worked closely with eavesdropping experts and gunmen working for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a drug trafficker who helped pay for the attacks on his rivals, the officers said.

These operations, the officers said, included the army's wide sweep through Tijuana in March 1996, a nationwide dragnet last fall for the killers of a police commander and the navy's seizure of a cocaine-laden freighter in January.

The arrest of General Gutierrez in February came just as the United States was weighing its annual certification of Mexico's full cooperation in the drug war. The arrest drew scathing criticism in Congress as a revelation of the extent of corruption, even as American and Mexican officials portrayed it as an instance of Mexico's determination to clean up the military.

President Ernesto Zedillo, in an interview on the eve of President Clinton's visit here early this month, called the military ''the best people that Mexico has, in spite of Mr. Gutierrez Rebollo.''

But officers have named at least four generals, in addition to General Gutierrez, as collaborators with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.

In one case, the trafficker was said to be using an air base commanded by one of his military associates to land drug planes. After another general died in an air crash in September 1995, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes and his wife were photographed at his funeral, according to the testimony.

By lifting the curtain on the inner workings of the Mexican Army, the court-martial is rocking an establishment that the American academic Roderic Ai Camp has called ''the most closed military in the world that I know of.''

General Gutierrez, who for seven years before his arrest was the commander in five central states and, starting in December, Mexico's anti-drug czar, has added to the fireworks. He has denied the charges against him and has argued in documents filed with the court that he kept the Secretary of Defense, Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, and his predecessor informed of all of his anti-drug efforts, including his dealings with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's organization.

And apparently threatening to come up with even more sensational revelations, the general has reported that a trafficker whom he detained and turned into an informer accused ''senior officials of the Mexican Government as protectors and members'' of a Tijuana drug cartel.

Asked for comment about the testimony, an officer in the Defense Ministry's Office of Social Communication, who identified himself as Lieutenant Colonel Aguilar, said only, ''Our institution has no point of view on these proceedings, and so we have no comment.''

Since the arrest of General Gutierrez, the allegations of drug corruption have come to encompass other senior officers.

In March, the Defense Ministry announced the arrest of Gen. Alfredo Navarro Lara, accusing him of offering a $1-million-a-month bribe to the general who is leading anti-narcotics efforts in Tijuana. The army say he offered the bribe on behalf of the Arellano Felix organization, Mexico's second-largest drug cartel.

For several years Mr. Carrillo Fuentes and the Arellano Felix brothers have been pursuing a murderous rivalry that has come to divide Mexico as fully as the 1980's vendetta between the Medellin and Cali cartels did Colombia.

General Gutierrez, who is 63, rose from second lieutenant to division general in just 31 years, promotions that usually take at least 35 years. His appointment as commander of Military Region No. 5, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and encompassing four surrounding states, capped what associates have called a brilliant military career as a cavalry officer, garrison commander and professor at Mexico's Senior War College.

Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, the testimony indicates, used General Gutierrez's love of horses as an early path to winning his cooperation.

The father of one of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's top associates owned a farm adjacent to the base in Guadalajara commanded by the general, and starting in 1995, General Gutierrez began to buy alfalfa from the father, who soon began sending sweet corn and tomatoes as gifts.

Those early offerings paid off in late 1995, when gunmen working for the Arellano Felix organization ambushed the farmer's son and granddaughter, wounding them both.

After that attack, the son, Eduardo Gonzalez Quirarte, limping on crutches, visited General Gutierrez at his downtown Guadalajara offices and offered information on the Arellano Felix organization, the general's subordinates testified. At that time, Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte was not widely known as a drug trafficker.

From that beginning grew ties that went far beyond the normal relationship between an investigator and his informant: the general became the instrument of one drug organization against another and, prosecutors assert, he received a variety of gifts.

Immediately after Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte volunteered his services, the general ordered a team of his plainclothes officers to Tijuana, where they worked with Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte and others to spy on the Arellano Felix operations.

These actions culminated in March 1996 in a army sweep by hundreds of soldiers through several Tijuana neighborhoods. The raid was seen as one of Mexico's most important anti-drug operations last year.

In testimony, the general's aides have said that in Guadalajara he adopted a lavish style, assigning soldiers as cooks, drivers and gardeners not only to his wife's household but also to two lovers' homes. General Gutierrez acquired a fleet of cars and armored Jeeps and purchased two thoroughbreds.

Some of the general's subordinates testifed that they were bewildered by their commander's new alliance with a drug-trafficking organization.

But over the following months, the general's associates got an inside look at the Carrillo Fuentes organization -- luxury homes in Guadalajara and Mexico City where Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte's aides used sophisticated eavesdropping equipment to scan hundreds of phone calls. They saw that Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte traveled in a convoy of 18 armored Land Cruisers, Jeeps and sedans, guarded by dozens of men with credentials issued by Mexican military intelligence, according to the testimony.

The aides testified that they discovered that Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's influence extended elsewhere in the army.

During 1996, the aides arrested an Air Force flight specialist who, under interrogation, acknowledged that he had been guiding the trafficker's planes into Guadalajara airports. Other testimony indicates that at least two generals deployed at Base No. 5 in the city were intimate friends of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.

After Arellano Felix gunmen killed one of General Gutierrez's closest intelligence aides last July, and later assassinated police commanders in Tijuana and Mexico City, the army's cooperation with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes deepened.

General Gutierrez's subordinates, working with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's eavesdroppers and gunmen, detained and interrogated dozens of suspected Arellano Felix associates, the testimony indicates.

Several army officers described to prosecutors how Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte and other traffickers participated in questioning the suspects.

Before one joint operation, the traffickers briefed one of the general's subordinates, showing him a file of reconnaissance photos of Arellano Felix associates and their residences, as well as tape recordings of telephone conversations the traffickers had intercepted, the testimony indicates.

For all this cooperation, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes expressed his gratitude, providing General Gutierrez with nearly a dozen armored vehicles, delivering monthly payments to his personal secretary and signing over a Guadalajara restaurant to another of the general's top aides. However, the Government has not yet produced evidence that the general accumulated a great fortune.

Last October, the trust was so high between General Gutierrez and the Carrillo Fuentes organization that the traffickers delivered encrypted cellular phones that allowed Mr. Carrillo Fuentes and his aides to talk freely with the general, his driver and other military officers, the testimony indicates.

In December, when General Gutierrez was named to head Mexico's top anti-drug agency, his first reaction was to call Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte and ask the trafficker to arrange a Mexico City apartment for a young lover.

Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte agreed. When the general's driver went to the trafficker's Mexico City residence to pick up the keys, Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte introduced him for the first time, face to face, to his boss.

''This is Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the Lord of the Skies,'' Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte told the driver, the testimony indicates. ''Feel proud. Many would like to meet him, but you are among the few who've succeeded.''

The testimony leaves in dispute why General Cervantes, the Defense Minister, ordered General Gutierrez's arrest in February. Army prosecutors say that General Gutierrez's driver phoned military authorities on Feb. 6, offering to inform on his boss. But General Gutierrez's lawyers insist that the Defense Secretary ordered the arrest after General Gutierrez protested cancellation of an operation intended to detain members of the Arellano Felix organization in Tijuana.

Days before General Gutierrez's detention, Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte told the general's driver that he and Mr. Carrillo Fuentes were planning to leave Mexico. A week later, the driver received a call from the two traffickers, who claimed to be phoning from Russia. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

''They said they couldn't work here because they hadn't been able to cut a deal with the authorities, referring to some lawyers representing the army's general staff,'' the driver, an army lieutenant, told the court. ''But they said that once they'd arranged matters with the authorities, they were going to bring in cocaine by the boatload, 30 tons at a time.''"
30,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"As the man in the videotape begins to spill the inner secrets of Mexico's most violent drug gang, he appears nervous, chewing off pieces of his left thumbnail and gulping water.

Alejandro Enrique Hodoyan had been a minor though well-placed member of the drug organization, running guns and errands. On the tape, he sits center stage, recounting in a soft voice how his brother and a circle of their childhood friends joined a criminal enterprise that killed dozens of police commanders, prosecutors, drug rivals and innocent bystanders.

''Killing is a party for them, it's a kick,'' Mr. Hodoyan tells Mexican investigators. ''No remorse at all. They laugh after a murder, and go off and have a lobster dinner.''

His testimony, which produced eight hours of videotape and more than 200 pages of transcripts, is viewed on both sides of the border as a law enforcement triumph, a breakthrough in Mexico's flagging fight against drug traffickers. Mexican officials say his disclosures have already prompted the dismissal of ''several dozen'' detectives and police commanders accused of ties to the Tijuana-based organization, which is led by the Arellano Felix brothers.

But behind the image on the videotape is a tale of a middle-class family torn apart, with brother turned against brother in a violent drug culture. It is also a story of kidnapping and coercion that highlights some of the perils for the United States in working with the secretive Mexican military, which has been given a central role in the drug war despite its lengthening record of corruption and brutality.

Mr. Hodoyan, an American citizen who was born in San Diego and lived most of his life just across the border in Tijuana, was abducted and detained illegally for 80 days by Mexican military officers. Soldiers tortured him with cigarette lighters and electric shocks to the eyelids, according to an account he later gave his family.

The Mexican military eventually turned Mr. Hodoyan over to American officials who are preparing a major new indictment against the Arellano Felix organization. Some American officials involved in the case now acknowledge that they were too willing to turn a blind eye to the methods used by the Mexican military to secure Mr. Hodoyan's cooperation.

American diplomats in Mexico learned of Mr. Hodoyan's captivity shortly after he was imprisoned, but did nothing to help him. After his family reported him missing to United States officials, a law enforcement agent assigned to the American Embassy interviewed him at a unused barracks, where he was blindfolded and handcuffed to a steel bed.

The embassy official assigned to follow up on the agent's report of a captive American citizen took no action. United States officials later described that as an egregious failure to deliver the basic protections guaranteed citizens in trouble in foreign lands.

Donald R. Hamilton, the embassy's spokesman, otherwise defended its handling of the case, saying Mr. Hodoyan did not complain of torture to any American official in Mexico or suggest that he was under duress.

The account of Mr. Hodoyan's experiences was pieced together from interviews with his family, American officials in Mexico, and Mexican justice officials who knew him as an informant. It is also based on confidential Mexican court documents as well as tape recordings, obtained by The New York Times, of telephone calls he made to his family in Tijuana last year when he was a military prisoner.

In December 1996, the military officer who supervised his interrogation and hand over to the Americans was appointed Mexico's top antidrug official, in part because of successes he scored in the drug war using information supplied by Mr. Hodoyan.

Two months later, that officer, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was jailed on charges of collaborating with another drug lord, a bitter rival of the Arellano Felix brothers. Mexican officials now suspect that much of the information the general extracted from Mr. Hodoyan went directly to the rival drug organization.

Since then, the military has dismissed and is investigating 33 other officers, including four generals, on corruption and narcotics charges, defense officials said.

In the end, Mr. Hodoyan was not much help to American prosecutors. After 10 days in San Diego, he suffered what family members described as a psychological breakdown. Under pressure to give evidence against his brother, he disappeared across the border to Mexico where he had numerous enemies, including the Arellano Felix gang, which, he was told, had put out a contract on his life.

The Setting: An Unlikely Family For a Crime Career
Alejandro Hodoyan, known to his family and friends as Alex, seemed an unlikely candidate for a career in crime. His mother Cristina, who is 55, is a prim, devoutly Catholic woman from an upstanding Mexican family. His father, Alejandro Hodoyan Ramirez, 63, is a respected Mexican civil engineer.

The Hodoyans hoped to raise their children with the best of the American and Mexican cultures. Their three boys and a girl were all born in San Diego, but the family lived just across the border in Tijuana, a city where the multibillion-dollar drug trade has in recent years become a lure even for privileged and educated young people.

The Hodoyan children came of age in Tijuana discos where teen-agers experimented with cocaine in the free-wheeling way of wealthy American youth. They also mingled with Mexican gang members who were rising stars in the cocaine business.

One of the flashiest was Ramon Arellano, a leader of the gang who met members of the Hodoyan family at a society wedding in Tijuana. It was a sweltering summer day, but Mr. Arellano sported a mink jacket and leather pants.

''He was wearing a big thick chain with a big gold cross encrusted with emeralds,'' said a Hodoyan relative, who asked not to be identified. ''Everything about him made you turn around and say, who is he?''

Mexican court documents describe Mr. Arellano as a compulsive murderer who has killed several times for sport and is implicated in more than 60 homicides. He and his brothers began their careers as provincial drug dealers, but shot and bullied their way to seize control of drug-smuggling along a western swath of the United States-Mexico border. One by one, friends the Hodoyans had known since childhood were drawn into the Arellanos' circle of riches and violence.

Fabian Martinez Gonzalez, a grade-school classmate of Alex Hodoyan's younger sister who teased the girls by lifting up their skirts, grew up to become El Tiburon, or the Shark. He is accused of being one of Mr. Arellano's most feared gunmen and is wanted for murder in Mexico.

Emilio Valdez Mainero was a boyhood buddy Mr. Hodoyan chose years later to be the godfather at his first daughter's baptism. Mr. Valdez became a top operative in the organization, arranging drug shipments and assassinations, the Mexican and American police have charged in court.

''In Tijuana the Arellanos bought their way into the cream of society,'' said a Mexican antidrug prosecutor who asked not to be identified. ''In a normal situation, a family like the Hodoyans would never find themselves involved with traffickers.''

The Detention: Claims of Torture, Then a 'Good Cop'
Mr. Hodoyan, the oldest of the Hodoyan children, is a 35-year old law school dropout and cocaine addict who never held a steady job. An even-tempered man with an amiable face, he started doing small favors for the Arellanos and eventually helped them import rifles and grenades to arm their hit squads. In return they gave him loads of cocaine and marijuana to move across the border, allowing him to keep the proceeds, he told Mexican prosecutors.

Alfredo Hodoyan, 25, the rakish and strong-willed brother who is Alex's youngest sibling, took on a more violent role in the gang, according to his brother and other associates. He joined one of the cartel's hit squads and is wanted on murder charges in Mexico.

On Sept. 10, 1996, the Arellano gang sent Alex Hodayan to Guadalajara, the central Mexican city that has emerged as a battleground for competing drug gangs. His mission, he later said, was to find a new ''safe house,'' a local base for the group's operations.

He was walking straight into a military trap.

Seven weeks earlier, gunmen for the Arellano organization had bungled a plot to assassinate Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the leader of a rival cartel. Instead they killed two army soldiers who were at the scene.

The killings infuriated the soldiers' commander, Gen. Gutierrez Rebollo, a bulldog of an officer with a shaven head who was in charge from his headquarters in Guadalajara of a vast military region encompassing much of central Mexico.

On the afternoon of Sept. 11, Alex Hodoyan went to an existing Arellano safe house in a working-class neighborhood. A squad of General Gutierrez Rebollo's intelligence troops, wearing black uniforms, was watching the house and seized him.

By law, the Mexican armed forces can hold criminal suspects for no more than 48 hours before turning them over to the civilian authorities. But General Gutierrez Rebollo kept Mr. Hodoyan incommunicado for the next two months, mainly in a vacant army base on the outskirts of Guadalajara. The troops had no arrest warrant and filed no report to the police.

Mr. Hodoyan's kidnapping and secret detention have been described in separate, mutually corroborating accounts by army officers who are now testifying against General Gutierrez Rebollo in two trials. Their statements are contained in confidential court records.

According to the officers, the windowless bunker where Mr. Hodoyan was shackled hand and foot to a bed was General Gutierrez Rebollo's private interrogation center, where illegally detained suspects were questioned for days and weeks.

After Mr. Hodoyan was released, he said the soldiers had tortured and threatened to kill him.

''They told me I had arrived in hell,'' he said in a statement he dictated to his parents months later.

According to Mr. Hodoyan, the soldiers forced soda water spiked with searing hot chile peppers up his nose until he was nearly asphyxiated. He said they had burned the soles of his feet with lighters and had applied electric shocks to his eyelids and toes.

Within days, several witnesses said, there was a change in Mr. Hodoyan's demeanor. He began to cooperate, almost too enthusiastically, with his captors. Drawing on his prodigious memory, he poured out what he knew about the Arellanos in manic bursts.

Mr. Hodoyan's claims of torture have not been confirmed by independent witnesses, and the statement he gave his family, which he never signed, remains the only record of his first days in captivity.

Two Mexicans who saw Mr. Hodoyan in later weeks of his detention say they noticed a fresh scar in the middle of his forehead. He told them that he had been tortured, but said he could not discuss the details. The scar, he said, was where skin peeled away when his duct tape blindfolds were changed.

General Gutierrez Rebollo played his prisoner with a maestro's touch, according to the officers who testified in the trials against him. He waited 13 days before visiting Mr. Hodoyan. Then he came on as the consummate good cop, pretending to scold his subordinates for treating the prisoner harshly and ordering them to loosen his manacles and upgrade his food.

Mr. Hodoyan soon became devoted to his jailer. When allowed, he trailed behind General Gutierrez Rebollo. A Mexican drug prosecutor who saw the two men together toward the end of Mr. Hodoyan's captivity said they were ''like father and son.''

General Gutierrez Rebollo had good reason to court Mr. Hodoyan. On Sept. 14, three days after Mr. Hodoyan was abducted by his soldiers, a hit squad linked to the Arellanos assassinated a top Mexican antidrug prosecutor in Mexico City.

Soon after, Mexican officials sent their American counterparts information developed by General Gutierrez Rebollo indicating that Alfredo Hodoyan, Alex's brother, was a triggerman in the killing. The Mexicans said Alfredo was hiding out near San Diego with Emilio Valdez, the godfather of Alex Hodoyan's daughter, who was wanted in Mexico on another murder charge.

American Federal agents arrested Mr. Valdez and Alfredo Hodoyan on Sept. 30 in San Diego, and at Mexico's request United States prosecutors opened an extradition case to return them to Mexico for trial.

General Gutierrez Rebollo set out to convince Alex Hodoyan to testify against his friend and his brother. In Mexico, where ties of blood and ritual kinship are nearly sacred and the law absolves suspects from incriminating immediate relatives, it was a formidable undertaking.

The Americans: A U.S. Agent Sees the Prisoner
As soon as the Hodoyan family realized Alex was missing, they turned to the American authorities for help. On Sept. 20, Adriana Hodoyan, Alex's sister, called the United States consulate in Guadalajara to say she believed that her brother, an American citizen, had vanished there.

Five days later, Adriana Hodoyan, who is 30, traveled to Guadalajara and gave the consulate a photo of Alex and a detailed account of the travel route he had planned.

On Oct. 7, when Alex Hodoyan had been missing for nearly a month, his sister called the consulate again. She was frantic. According to American officials, she said there were reports that Alex had been detained on Sept. 11 by the military authorities in Guadalajara.

American diplomats in Guadalajara made what they later described as routine phone calls to local police stations and jails to see if he was there. ''It was just a usual-suspects thing,'' a United States official in Guadalajara said, just another of the 71 cases the consulate handled in 1996 of Americans who went missing in that region.

No one at the consulate ever spoke with the Mexican military.

''We would have no reason to call the military,'' an American official said, explaining that the armed forces do not usually detain people under Mexico's legal system.

But on Oct. 7, the day of Adriana Hodoyan's most urgent appeal for help, one arm of the United States Government learned that the Mexican military knew exactly where to find Mr. Hodoyan.

Officers at the Defense Ministry in Mexico City invited an agent from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to question an exceptional informant they had about arms smuggling to Mexican drug traffickers. Not long after General Gutierrez Rebollo had captured Mr. Hodoyan, he had informed his superiors about him.

The A.T.F. bureau declined to make the agent who questioned Mr. Hodoyan available for an interview. His account was relayed by officials in Washington and Mexico who said they had reviewed reports the agent filed at the time.

American officials said the Mexican armed forces had provided an airplane to fly the A.T.F. agent to Guadalajara. Two Mexican officers, in plain clothes, drove the agent to the base where Mr. Hodoyan was held and accompanied him into the meeting.

In the bare room, the agent introduced himself to Mr. Hodoyan, blindfolded and cuffed to a bed. The agent later told colleagues that it bothered him that he could not see the prisoner's eyes.

Nevertheless, for nearly two hours the American agent probed to find out what the prisoner knew about the traffic of weapons.

''The amazing thing is, the guy just doesn't shut up,'' said a United States official who questioned the A.T.F. agent about Mr. Hodoyan. ''He is talking, talking, talking. He immediately implicated his brother and himself in a number of crimes.''

Mexican officers told the A.T.F. agent that Mr. Hodoyan had been blindfolded to prevent him from seeing the American's face, since the prisoner, they said, was a ''dangerous and violent criminal.''

The echo-filled room and strangely empty military barracks struck the A.T.F. agent as an ''unusual but not inappropriate'' place for the meeting.

After two hours, the official said, the agent believed that he ''had a live one.'' He began to make mental plans to take Mr. Hodoyan to the United States as a witness in gun-running cases.

That was when Mr. Hodoyan, who had spoken throughout the interview in Spanish, announced that he would not need a visa.

''I was born in San Diego,'' he said. ''I am an American citizen.''

Mr. Hodoyan volunteered nothing about mistreatment by the soldiers, American officials said, and the statement he later gave his family suggests a reason.

General Gutierrez Rebollo's officers, he said, warned him before the interview that if he told the A.T.F. agent about his torture, ''he would be the last person I would ever cross a word with.''

The day after the interview, Mexican military officials told the A.T.F. agent that the general had changed his mind and was not ready to release Mr. Hodoyan.

The agent remained uneasy about what he had seen. He consulted with the No. 2 official in the embassy, Charles H. Brayshaw, who sent him to the consul general for Mexico City, a senior diplomat who handles problems involving United States citizens.

For half an hour, the agent described the American imprisoned in Guadalajara. According to American officials, the consul general, Thomas L. Randall, told the A.T.F. agent he believed that Mr. Hodoyan was probably one more Mexican trying to get out of a jam by claiming to be an American.

Then, several officials said, Mr. Randall did nothing further about Mr. Hodoyan. ''He didn't tell anybody above, below or alongside,'' a diplomat said later, calling Mr. Randall's performance ''a clear case of nonfeasance.''

''Had this person done even the minimum which duty, regulation, law and custom indicate, the consular service would not have been ignorant of Mr. Hodoyan's detention,'' said Mr. Hamilton, the spokesman for the embassy in Mexico City. Mr. Hamilton refused to identify the consul involved in the case.

A Washington spokesman for the A.T.F bureau, Patrick D. Hynes, said classified memos showed that the agent had met with the embassy's consul general, which was the position Mr. Randall held at the time. Other officials confirmed that it was Mr. Randall, who was recalled from Mexico to Washington late last year and retired from the Foreign Service in January 1997.

Reached by telephone at his southern California residence, Mr. Randall said he had no recollection of Mr. Hodoyan's case.

''I'm sure I would have done whatever needed to be done,'' he said, calling it ''convenient'' that embassy officials had heaped all of the blame on the one person involved who was no longer in government service.

Mr. Brayshaw did not inquire again what had become of Mr. Hodoyan because he assumed that the Consul General had done his job, Mr. Hamilton said.

The Family: His Daughters Come Before Brother
In late October, General Gutierrez Rebollo was sufficiently confident of his new informant's cooperation that he allowed him to call his family and tell them he was still alive.

They were elated but deeply worried. After the first contact, Mr. Hoyodan was allowed to call his parents regularly, and as he talked in guarded language, they realized that he was informing on the Arellano gang and was under pressure to turn on his own brother.

For his parents the conversations were agonizing. Their eldest son was in the custody of powerful Mexican military officers who, Alex hinted, would think nothing of killing him. The officers were trying to pit Alex against their youngest son, who was in jail in San Diego fighting extradition to Mexico on a murder charge that could put him in prison for decades.

Mr. Hoyodan's mother and father urged him to remain loyal to the family and his circle of childhood friends.

But Mr. Hodoyan was bitter that the Arellano gang had sent him into an ambush. And General Gutierrez Rebollo was leaning heavily on Mr. Hodoyan to talk by offering to place him in a Government witness program where his past criminal record would be erased.

Tape recordings of some of Mr. Hodoyan's phone calls to his family were made available to The New York Times by participants in the events who requested anonymity. They depict a man overwhelmed by irreconcilable pressures and dominated by a captor who both terrifies him and inspires his devotion.

Cooperating with General Gutierrez Rebollo, he argued, was the only way he could survive to see his two young daughters again.

''I love my brother, Mama,'' Mr. Hodoyan told his mother at one point. ''But my daughters come first.''

In one conversation his father asked him what he wanted to tell his brother Alfredo and his brother's lawyers.

''Tell them I made a deal with the general, and the general is keeping his word to me,'' Mr. Hodoyan said. ''He even bought new clothes for me.''

''He spared my life and I want to keep my word to him, too,'' he said later in the conversation.

At one point, the elder Mr. Hodoyan told his son that a Mexican lawyer who had defended the Arellanos was offering to help get Alex out of military custody.

Alex exploded, saying: ''I don't matter to them! I never did. They just want to help me now because they have problems with the military and the police. They see the end coming.''

''My stomach is starting to hurt,'' he said as he raged at the Arellanos. Finally he broke down in sobs. ''I don't want them using me,'' he said, cursing the Arrelanos.

Mr. Hodoyan made it clear that General Gutierrez Rebollo had promised him that his statements against Alfredo could not be used in any Mexican or American court because they were brothers.

''My son, it's a trap -- you're in a trap, try to understand,'' Cristina Hodoyan entreated in a phone call on Dec. 10. ''You are helping the man who is accusing your brother!''

''He can't,'' Mr. Hodoyan insisted. ''Alfredo is my brother. He can't.''

His parents hoped that if Alex was freed, he would testify in the effort to block Alfredo's extradition in San Diego. But they warned Alex that he would have to reveal that he had been tortured by the troops.

Alex Hodoyan panicked, afraid that General Gutierrez Rebollo would retaliate if he denounced him.

''No! No! They never did anything to me, Mama, please try to understand,'' he said. ''I thought I explained that to you. I can't say anything about that until I finish what I am doing here.''

Alex's father suggested to his son that he was suffering from Stockholm syndrome, which occurs when kidnap victims become attached to their kidnappers. Alex rejected the idea with a fervor that suggested he knew it could be true.

''Look, Papa, everything they promised me they have done,'' Alex Hodoyan said of the military. ''I don't want trouble. I don't want them to kill me. I don't want that.''

Mrs. Hodoyan said she felt torn apart by the clashing interests of her two sons.

''Alex, above all, we have to be united,'' Mrs. Hodoyan said, her voice taut with pain.

Alex replied: ''I am not sure if I can help Alfredo, but at least I am sure I will be free and clear for the rest of my life. But if they hurt me here, who will take care of my little girls? They will be left without a father.''

The Aftermath: General's Arrest Destroys His Hopes
General Gutierrez Rebollo won the fight for Alex Hodoyan's allegiance. In the last days of November 1996, he summoned Mexican civilian prosecutors to Guadalajara. In three days of declarations, including the sections on videotape, Mr. Hodoyan once again told all he knew about the Arellanos -- this time for the legal record.

Speaking to the police video camera in measured words and abundant detail, he accused his brother Alfredo of taking part in not one but several killings.

''Prior to the murder the witness's brother arrived at the hotel,'' the record of Mr. Hodoyan's testimony reads, referring to the April 1996 killing of a Mexican boxer said to have encroached on the Arellanos' turf. Alfredo Hodoyan and one other gunman ''were responsible for finding the victim, whom they murdered in the hallway that connects the restaurant and the bathrooms of the hotel.''

In December, after General Gutierrez Rebollo was promoted to head Mexico's antidrug agency, he offered agents from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration a chance to debrief his informant.

The D.E.A. had been told of Mr. Hodoyan's military detention more than a month earlier by the A.T.F. agent who questioned him. Still, the drug enforcement agents eagerly accepted the offer as a rare chance to cooperate with the Mexican military and improve their relations with the general.

''He was showing results,'' the law enforcement official said. ''He was a very confident guy who projected the sense that 'we're the military -- we're going to get the job done.' His methods, frankly, were overlooked.''

By February, Mr. Hodoyan had completed his transformation from hostage to informant. He had been granted formal immunity from prosecution in Mexico in exchange for his testimony. He moved freely about the headquarters of the federal drug agency in the capital, where General Gutierrez Rebollo had been transferred.

On Feb. 10, D.E.A. agents flew Mr. Hodoyan to the United States. They interviewed him, and hoped that he would eventually be a cooperating witness for the Government against the Arellanos. The D.E.A. did not allow its Mexico agents to comment about their role.

But James J. McGivney, the agency's spokesman, said Mr. Hodoyan had given no indication he had ever been mistreated. ''Every time the D.E.A. saw this guy, he was walking around having a good time,'' Mr. McGivney said. ''When we see him, he's not bruised, not beaten, no chili peppers up his nose, no signs of duress.''

Soon after he arrived in the United States, Mr. Hodoyan, his 32-year-old wife, Bertha Gastelum de Hodoyan, and his mother met with the American prosecutor who was handling the extradition of his brother.

The mother said she had prodded Alex to tell the Assistant United States Attorney, Gonzalo P. Curiel, about his torture in Mexico. But according to both women, Mr. Curiel was reluctant to listen. He replied, ''This is more than I want to hear.''

Mr. Curiel declined to be interviewed, noting that he is barred from discussing pending cases.

On Feb. 18, the fragile world Mr. Hodoyan built as an informant imploded. Mexican military officials announced the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo. They released photographs showing that as drug czar he had lived in a luxury apartment owned by Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the leading trafficker.

Mr. Hodoyan reeled. His savior was just another drug don. The information he had given to redeem himself had probably just gone to benefit another cartel.

Meanwhile, one of the Arellanos top gunmen, Fabian Martinez, ''the Shark,'' placed several calls from hiding to the Hodoyans, saying he knew Alex was a Government informant.

Then the American prosecutor, Mr. Curiel, said he intended to put Mr. Hodoyan before a grand jury investigating Arellano operatives, including his brother and his friend Mr. Valdez, Mr. Hodoyan's family said. He would have to go briefly to jail, but then he, his wife and daughters could join a witness protection program.

''I'll never forget what he said,'' recalled his wife, Bertha Hodoyan. '' 'You know what?' he said. 'I'd rather have them kill me.' ''

Before dawn on the morning of Feb. 20, Mr. Hodoyan committed what a United States official described as ''totally irrational and suicidal act.'' He bolted from San Diego and appeared, wild-eyed and disheveled, at his parents' home in Tijuana.

''He was crazy, loco, desperate,'' Bertha Hodoyan said. ''He was crying, telling us he was sorry. Completely neurotic. He was just like a little child, crying and crying.''

Thirteen days later, when Mr. Hodoyan was driving in downtown Tijuana with his mother, armed men blocked the path of their vehicle, dragged him out, shoved him into another car and sped away.

He has not been heard from since.

His brother Alfredo and his friend Mr. Valdez remain in prison in San Diego fighting extradition to Mexico. Their lawyers have asserted that the statements of Alex Hodoyan and other witnesses provided by Mexico were obtained through torture and are thus invalid.

Mr. Curiel acknowledged recently at a court hearing in San Diego that the allegations of torture were plausible and serious, but said they should be investigated by the Mexican authorities."
31,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"The disappearance here earlier this year of Manuel Hernandez, a Texas drywall contractor and former marijuana dealer, with two relatives began like many others. Uniformed federal policemen smashed into a working-class home and dragged the men away, in full view of municipal police officers and frightened neighbors.

Then came the official denials. Mr. Hernandez's wife, Maria Elba, trudged for days from police stations to hospitals and morgues, everywhere getting the same brusque treatment: nobody knew anything about Mr. Hernandez. Although he is an American citizen, the United States Consulate was not much help either.

Nine months later, Mr. Hernandez is still missing. His case is part of a pattern unfolding just across America's southwest border: the disappearance of scores, perhaps hundreds, of people at the hands of Mexican security forces. Human rights groups say many of the disappearances appear to be part of a dirty war against people suspected of being drug traffickers.

In Juarez alone, a gritty border city that is a crossroads in a multibillion-dollar drug trade, nearly 90 people have vanished, including 8 United States citizens. Like Mr. Hernandez, many have had at least peripheral ties with the narcotics underworld.

The evidence in some cases suggests that the victims were arrested and killed by Mexican police officers or soldiers who were hired by traffickers to eliminate rivals or punish debtors. In other cases, the victims appear to have been detained for interrogation by anti-drug agents before they vanished.

The Mexican authorities say they are looking into the disappearances and have appointed a special investigator, but not one case has been resolved. Nowhere in the world have so many people disappeared in the context of drug-related violence, human rights groups say.

''There's just no parallel to what's happening in Mexico's northern states,'' said Morris Tidball Binz, who heads Amnesty International's programs in Latin America. ''We're seeing disappearances of the type seen in the 1970's, and the number of reported cases has shot up over the last year and a half.

''The person vanishes, and even though the police or the military are responsible, there is absolute denial from the authorities.''

To combat official stonewalling, relatives of scores of the missing have joined a newly formed Association of Relatives of Disappeared Persons. Its members include people from Juarez and El Paso, which together form one metropolitan area straddling the border. Their aim is to press the authorities for a full accounting, but they complain that officials have remained unresponsive.

Two Americans, Jaime F. Hervella, an El Paso accountant, and Saul Sanchez, a retired Labor Department employee from Laredo, Tex., founded the association after a fruitless three-year search for Mr. Sanchez's son, Saul Sanchez Jr. A 35-year-old United States Navy veteran, Mr. Sanchez Jr. disappeared in Juarez with his wife, Abigail, in May 1994 while selling microwave communications equipment to Mexico's federal police.

''The authorities treated us as if to say, 'Look, your relatives are gone, and that's just too bad,' '' said Mr. Hervella, the missing man's godfather.

This summer the two Americans placed newspaper advertisements inviting others with loved ones lost in Juarez to get in touch with the association's office, which is next to Mr. Hervella's accounting business in an El Paso shopping center.

The response has been stunning. In recent weeks, dozens of relatives, including Mrs. Hernandez, have called in to tell of the disappearance of more than 50 people in the last three years, most of them after detention by Chihuahua State or federal police.

A list of people who have disappeared in Juarez since 1993, compiled by a local newspaper, Norte, bears 56 names.

Reports of disappearances have emerged recently in other important drug marketplaces across northern Mexico as well. In the states of Baja California, Sonora and Sinaloa, families have reported that since mid-1996 about 20 relatives have vanished after detention.

But nowhere have so many cases been reported as in Ciudad Juarez, possibly because Mexico's largest drug cartel is based here. The Chihuahua authorities have compiled a list of 100 people who have disappeared in the state this year alone.

These disappearances are in addition to the scores of bodies dumped in ditches and fields around Juarez every year, most of them victims of drug or sexual violence.

The disappeared people include a wealthy onetime Government prosecutor whose wife now drives to association meetings in a Mercedes-Benz, an adviser to a congressman from Mexico's governing party, a recently retired Chihuahua state policeman, a former Mexican Army lieutenant and an assembly line worker whose grieving mother lives in a dirt-floor shack.

Opening the association's office in El Paso seems to have been crucial for its success. Many relatives say that they are terrified and that locating the association in Juarez would have been unthinkable, for fear that its offices would be attacked. But the association has registered with the Mexican Government and holds meetings in Juarez.

For its part, the Clinton Administration largely appears to have turned a blind eye toward the disappearances, consistently praising the Mexican Government's anti-drug efforts. Officials at the United States Consulate say their involvement has been limited because the families of only two of the eight missing Americans have sought help. In those two cases, family members said consular officials had acted sluggishly on their behalf.

But consular officials denied that. ''Protecting American citizens is the most important thing we do here,'' said David C. Stewart, the consulate's No. 2 official.

Who is responsible for the disappearances? ''I wish I knew,'' the Mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Juan Ramon Galindo, said in an interview. ''But I wouldn't be surprised to find that federal police are involved.

''One of our problems is that our officers can be bought. These are Mexican, not American police, and they reflect Mexico's problems: the lack of education, poverty. We can't hope that they will act like police from other places.''

Juarez is the main gateway used by the drug cartel controlled by Amado Carrillo Fuentes until his death in July. Many of the abductions appear to have been carried out by corrupt police officers on the cartel's behalf, to settle scores, punish informants or protect its turf against rivals. Other abductions appear to have been committed by Mexican security officials in overzealous anti-drug operations.

''What worries us enormously is the involvement of men with federal or state judicial police credentials or uniforms,'' said Alberto Medrano Villarreal, president of the Juarez Bar Association. ''Just because people are suspected of involvement in the drug trade does not mean you can allow them to be seized and killed without trial. Our entire system of law is being violated.''

The Bar Association published open letters in Juarez newspapers this year, including one during a recent visit by President Ernesto Zedillo, urging him to intervene.

Earlier this year, Jorge Madrazo, Mexico's Attorney General, quietly appointed a 72-year-old lawyer, Francisco Hernandez Vazquez, as a special prosecutor to investigate the disappearances.

''In the majority of cases, there are signs of the involvement of armed elements, who people believe belong to one of the police forces because they use uniforms or insignia or vehicles associated with the police,'' Mr. Hernandez Vazquez said in an interview.

But he added: ''There is nothing to prove that the disappearances reflect a policy of the Mexican state. They just appear to reflect the actions of certain police groups.''

The armed men appear to wield tremendous influence, however. No one interferes with them.

In February 1995, for example, after a Colombian man was acquitted of drug charges in a Federal trial in El Paso, American agents escorted him to the international bridge to Juarez and released him to his Mexican lawyer.

As the two men began walking toward Juarez, six men drove up, waved Mexican federal police credentials and dragged them into their car. Hours later, the federal police acknowledged to relatives of the men that they were in custody, but they were never seen again.

Agents of the National Institute to Combat Drugs, Mexico's now-defunct anti-narcotics agency, were implicated in the disappearance in November 1995 of two brothers who owned a Juarez steak house, along with an employee.

A man who washed cars in a police garage testified that two days after the three were reported missing, he saw federal agents shove the restaurant worker into a vehicle at the garage.

The Governor of Chihuahua, Francisco Barrio Terrazas, acknowledged the Government's involvement in that case. ''We've found that there were officers from the institute that carried them off, apparently without having an arrest warrant,'' Mr. Barrio said weeks after their disappearance.

In June 1996, Chihuahua police searching for a missing Juarez man found his Suburban parked outside a restaurant. Inside were several agents of the anti-drug institute -- as well as the missing man, who was lying on the floor in the rear.

It appeared that the federal agents were using him to identify the restaurant's customers. His family never received further information about his whereabouts.

In fact, no relatives have learned anything reliable about the whereabouts of their disappeared loved ones, although their fears have fueled speculation.

Several families said they believed that their relatives had been arrested and turned over to the Drug Enforcement Administration and were being held incomunicado in the United States.

James J. McGivney, a spokesman for the agency, said: ''That is an absurd claim, just nonsense.''

Mr. Hernandez Vazquez, the Government investigator, said police officers in Juarez had told him, ''The desert around Ciudad Juarez is a vast cemetery.''

And Manuel Hernandez's wife said a Government detective had told her that traffickers had murdered her husband on a distant ranch. ''He told me they use a big oven to cremate the disappeared,'' she said."
32,NYT,Staff,1998,Mexico Drug Corruption,"Hoping to build a new bulwark against the flow of illegal drugs from Latin America, the United States is providing the Mexican military with extensive covert intelligence support and training hundreds of its officers to help shape a network of anti-drug troops around the country, United States and Mexican officials say.

The officials say the assistance has included training, equipment and advice from the Central Intelligence Agency to establish an elite army intelligence unit that has quietly moved to the forefront of Mexico's anti-drug effort, sometimes ahead of a new civilian police force that the United States is also pledged to support.

The effort has proceeded despite growing American concern that it may lead to more serious problems of corruption and human rights in one of Mexico's most respected institutions, United States officials say. A new United States intelligence analysis of the military's drug ties, for instance, will cite evidence of extensive penetration of the officer corps, two people who have seen draft versions of the assessment said.

Clinton Administration officials have described the American aid as a stopgap. Echoing Mexico's President, Ernesto Zedillo, they insist that the military's law-enforcement actions will be limited and temporary, helping to disrupt the country's thriving drug trade only until its badly corrupted federal police forces can be overhauled.

But according to many officials, the Pentagon and the C.I.A. have pressed their help partly out of their need to find new tasks after the cold war. They hope to use the aid to expand their roles in the anti-drug campaign in Mexico and to improve their relationships with a secretive, nationalistic neighboring army that has often looked at them with suspicion, the officials said.

''They didn't have anybody to play with on the Mexican end of the drug issue, so they went for the military,'' a former senior official who was involved in American policy in Mexico said, referring to the Defense Department and the C.I.A. ''They knew the risks, but they thought they could control the situation.''

Some of those risks have resounded in recent news reports: the jailing of army generals on charges of protecting major drug traffickers; allegations that military officers have been linked to the torture and disappearance of criminal suspects; failures of due process and proper legal procedure by soldiers stepping in for the police.

Other pitfalls have been less apparent. Some officials, for instance, worry that American intelligence officers may face conflicts in trying to build good relationships with Mexican Army officers to sustain the cooperation, and trying to remain watchful of military corruption at the same time.

A few other current and former United States officials date their unease to what they described as a disastrous C.I.A. program in the late 1980's to deploy a Mexican Army strike force against the traffickers. The force was disbanded after several failed operations, one of which resulted in the killing of four Mexican civilians.

Mexico has long stood out in Latin America for the sureness of its civilian control over the military. But American officials said they had been troubled by indications that some officers detailed to the federal police have operated with considerable independence from the judicial authorities. With the Mexican Army searching for new missions, many American officials doubt that it will limit its participation in law enforcement to the two-year deadline that Mr. Zedillo and his aides set last summer.

''The whole thing has snowballed,'' said a senior American official who, like others, would discuss the matter only on the condition that he not be identified. ''We are now seeing two separate anti-drug efforts in Mexico -- one by the military and one under the Attorney General. If I were in the Attorney General's office, I would be asking whether it has gone too far.''

To some degree, the policy debate is fueled by old rivalries between American law-enforcement agencies and their intelligence and military counterparts. But the two sides also have some philosophical differences, which center on the question of whether United States support for the military complements or competes with efforts to transform Mexico's crippled criminal-justice system.

''They have basically got to rebuild their entire police force,'' a senior drug-enforcement official said of the Mexican Government. ''You can't do that in a year or two. And the longer the emphasis is put on the military, the longer it is going to take to get the police up and running.''

The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, disputed the idea that the two directions of American anti-drug aid in Mexico were at cross purposes. ''There is no conflict,'' he said.

James R. Jones, who left Mexico City this summer after serving for four years as the United States Ambassador there, echoed that view, and denied that American officials had encouraged the Mexican military's new role.

''The temporary detailing of military officers to civilian law-enforcement was the Mexicans' and Zedillo's decision -- we had nothing to do with that,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Our efforts to improve the quality and exchange of intelligence information and our training programs for certain military units had nothing to do with their decision.''

The C.I.A.'s chief spokesman, Bill Harlow, declined to comment on the agency's activities in Mexico.

Past Experience: Corruption Seen In Old Program
Despite a widespread belief in the corruption of Mexico's federal and state police, Mexicans and their political leaders have been wary about seeking the help of the military to enforce civilian laws.

In the late 1970's, Mexican officials turned to the army to help drive marijuana and heroin-poppy growers from their sanctuaries in the rugged folds of the western Sierra Madre. Their sweep succeeded in temporarily dislodging the traffickers, and it institutionalized a program in which about 20,000 of the army's 150,000 soldiers are detailed to drug-crop eradication campaigns.

For an army that has relatively little to do in securing the country's borders, the drug eradication program has been a source of pride. Yet even while it avoided police-type activities, the military was shaken during the 1980's and early 1990's by public allegations that some senior officers -- including a former Defense Minister, a Secretary of the Navy and several senior army commanders -- colluded in the drug trade.

After Carlos Salinas de Gortari became President in late 1988, American officials said, they gave relatively little thought to the Mexican Army because of their hopes that at least one of the Government's many police-reform campaigns would succeed. Some also harbored cause for concern in the experience of the Mexican Army strike force created years earlier.

With anti-drug efforts stalled in 1987, American agents developed information that big traffickers were building nearly impenetrable compounds in the countryside. Working with the military, current and former officials said, C.I.A. officers helped form what they envisioned as an elite team of about 50 soldiers that would strike more effectively and operate more securely than the police. Mexican law-enforcement officials were told nothing of the plan, they said.

The team's first operation, against a stronghold of a cocaine smuggler in Sinaloa state, ended with one soldier's capture by a police agent working for the traffickers, two former officials said.

The next foray went considerably worse. On the morning of April 11, 1988, helicopters swung out of the dawn sky near the northern town of Caborca, a sanctuary of a reputed marijuana smuggler.

''The idea was that you could take a well-trained military unit and go in there and boom -- take everybody out,'' a former official said.

The soldiers did take everyone out, but they did so at what turned out to be a workshop in a residential neighborhood, killing four apprentice welders. Former officials said the Mexican Attorney General at the time, Sergio Garcia Ramirez, was so mystified that he asked whether American agents had carried out the raid themselves.

Eventually, the military issued a terse statement taking responsibility for the attack but not disclosing the C.I.A.'s involvement. After a third, unsuccessful raid on another suspected drug base, the program was shut down for good, the officials said.

Zedillo's Effort: Military Is Given A Bigger Role
Mexico was near the same point in its political cycle -- the end of a six-year presidential term, a period when corruption has historically flourished among outgoing officials -- when United States officials looked to the military again in 1994.

The idea of greater army support for the police was raised first by American diplomats and again during a visit by the United States Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Gordon Sullivan, current and former American officials said. But at the time, they said, it was rejected by Mexican justice officials.

Mr. Zedillo, who took office on Dec. 1, 1994, has called drug trafficking one of Mexico's most serious problems of national security. United States officials strongly endorsed that view, briefing his aides on such developments as the use of passenger jets to fly cocaine into Mexico from Colombia.

''The military was the only trained, disciplined force that you could use to deal with this situation in the short term,'' one of Mr. Zedillo's closest aides said. ''There was no one else.''

Mr. Zedillo first brought army commanders into the redesign of the Government's drug-control strategy. He then authorized them to work with United States officials in an ultimately abortive effort to deploy its aging F-5 fighters to chase drug jets. Finally, he began allowing military officers to replace federal police agents in several border cities plagued by smugglers.

In October 1995, when William J. Perry made the first official visit to Mexico in memory by an American Secretary of Defense, anti-drug aid was at the center of several cooperative ventures he proposed to Mexican military officials, Mexican and United States military officials said.

''You were looking for general ways to engage, military to military,'' a Pentagon official said. Within months, a first group of young Mexican Army officers were training in anti-drug operations at Fort Bragg, N.C.

Of some 3,000 Mexican soldiers who are expected to have passed through Defense Department training courses by next fall, 328 young officers will have completed special 12- and 13-week programs intended to create a corps of anti-drug specialists. Those trainers are being sent in turn to train air-mobile special forces units that are now stationed at the headquarters of the 12 regions and 40 zones that make up Mexico's military geography.

Defense Department officials said the anti-drug curriculum of the units, called Air-Mobile Special Forces Groups, ranged from air-assault operations and military policing to human rights. The Pentagon has also given Mexico 73 aging UH-1H helicopters to transport those troops.

The helicopters may be used only for anti-drug operations. But Mexican and United States military officials said there was nothing to stop the transfer of American-trained army officers to similar special forces units that might be deployed against leftist insurgents in southern states like Guerrero and Chiapas.

C.I.A. Support: Special Force Gets Mixed Reviews
American officials said that what is perhaps the most significant United States support for the Mexican military's anti-drug efforts is probably the least visible. It comes, they said, in the training, equipping and operational support of C.I.A. officers for a special force of the army intelligence section called the Center for Anti-Narcotics Investigations.

The unit, comprising some 90 carefully chosen young officers, began to come together about three years ago, officials said. Like the civilian intelligence groups the C.I.A. works with in Mexico, the military anti-drug force is not supposed to be an ''action'' unit like the group trained by the agency in the 1980's. But it does appear to sometimes take the lead in raids as well as surveillance actions.

Several American officials compared the program to the C.I.A.'s work in Colombia, where the agency has been credited with critical help in the capture of major drug traffickers. A key difference, they noted, has been Mexico's extreme sensitivity to anything involving the C.I.A.

Officials familiar with the operations of the intelligence team said that after a clumsy start -- at one point its agents lost track of an important Bolivian drug broker they had under surveillance because they insisted on asking a superior for instructions rather than simply follow him -- it has emerged as probably the most active of all Mexican anti-drug units.

Officials said the unit played a central part in the pursuit of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, then Mexico's most important trafficker, before he died during plastic surgery last summer. It also worked closely on the investigation of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's organization after his death, and on a series of raids against the Tijuana-based drug mafia run by the Arellano Felix brothers.

Yet reviews of the unit, which is known by its initials in Spanish as the Cian, have been mixed.

Officials said some Mexican prosecutors have complained privately that the unit's officials have demonstrated spotty notions of the law, at times handing captured suspects over to the civilian authorities without ever gathering evidence to hold them. Some Mexican police investigators have also questioned why -- if the United States is willing to provide the sort of sophisticated surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment that it is said to have given to the Cian -- it will not offer the same support to new anti-drug units created in the Attorney General's office.

American officials said questions had been raised about the unit's integrity after two of its agents were dismissed this year for what one official described as ''unprofessional conduct.'' Some have also wondered about its independence -- from both Mexican civilians and American intelligence officers.

''It could be a time bomb,'' a former intelligence official said, ''because they have a lot less control over that unit than they think they do.''

The Mexican Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Juan Heriberto Salinas Altes, praised the unit, saying it has gathered important information for both army special-forces troops and the federal police. He denied, however, that the unit has any formal or continuing relationship with the C.I.A.

''There could have been some contact, but it was not any official contact,'' General Salinas Altes said in an interview, his first since becoming Chief of Staff three years ago.

Vulnerability: Can the Military Resist Temptation?
For their part, Clinton Administration officials said the closer military relationship that anti-drug cooperation had already paid dividends for the United States. In recent months, they noted, Mexican officials agreed to streamline procedures by which United States drug-surveillance planes are allowed to fly over Mexican airspace, and those by which Coast Guard ships can dock at Mexican ports.

The impact of American support on the Mexican military's anti-drug efforts remains somewhat to be seen. Thus far, Defense Department officials said they knew of no instance in which special forces officers trained in the United States had been sent off on an American-donated helicopter in the pursuit of a drug flight.

But many United States officials said it had already become evident that although the Mexican officer corps may be more resistant to the traffickers' bribes than the police, it faces a more serious threat than most American officials foresaw.

Clinton Administration officials were shocked this year when the army commander installed as the Zedillo government's drug-enforcement chief, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested for taking bribes from Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, the trafficker. Since then, though, it has become clear that the episode was not an isolated one.

Other high-ranking officers have been implicated in connection with Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's organization, including one retired general who was arrested after the wedding of the trafficker's sister. Several more senior officers have been arrested for their supposed ties to the rival trafficking organization run out of Tijuana by the Arellano Felix brothers; one has been charged with offering $1 million monthly bribes to another army general who serves as the Attorney General's representative there.

Still, United States officials are divided between those who see new proof of the military's vulnerability and those who see evidence of an institution fighting aggressively against temptation. Mexican officials, not surprisingly, side strongly with the latter camp.

''If there is action, there are going to be people hurt,'' General Salinas Altes said. ''We have people killed. We have people wounded. We have people in jail.''

General Salinas Altes has himself been a focus of the American scrutiny.

According to officials familiar with American intelligence reports in which the Chief of Staff is mentioned, he first came to the United States' attention after he moved from Baja California in 1988 to head the Ninth Military Region headquarters in the city of Acapulco. There, he spent six years in charge of drug-eradication efforts in Guerrero, the state that is Mexico's leading producer of heroin poppies.

After he became Chief of Staff in December 1994, two American officials said, General Salinas Altes was again briefly a subject of scrutiny when intelligence officials intercepted a drug trafficker's telephone call for a ''General Salinas.'' They described the report as disturbing but unclear.

Most recently, United States officials became concerned again this summer when it emerged that General Salinas Altes and several other senior officers had met with a top lieutenant of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes. According to a military document published in the Mexican magazine Proceso that appears to be notes from the Jan. 14 meeting, the lieutenant, Eduardo Gonzalez Quirarte, said the trafficker had offered essentially to clean up his business -- halting the sale of drugs in Mexico, eschewing violence, helping the economy -- if he was allowed to keep half his fortune and continue operating in peace.

General Salinas Altes was interviewed at his Mexico City offices on the condition that he not be questioned about the allegations against him, but only about the cooperative efforts he oversees as the military's representative to an anti-drug group of senior officials from the two countries.

But in a separate interview, Gen. Tomas Angeles Dauahare, a senior aide to Mexico's Defense Minister, Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, dismissed the allegations against General Salinas Altes vehemently.

General Angeles confirmed that Mexican military officials had received an unsigned American report forwarded from the Foreign Ministry. After an extensive investigation, in which United States officials did not answer repeated requests for supplementary information, he said, it was found that the guilty officer was in fact a Gen. Javier Salinas Payares, the commander of a military air base, and that he was eventually imprisoned in the case.

Similarly, General Angeles said there was no evidence that General Salinas Altes had acted inappropriately in meeting with Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte, who he said had posed as a young businessman with information about the Carrillo Fuentes mob.

''He spoke about Amado Carrillo,'' General Angeles said. ''He gave information about the drug organization internationally. It was only discovered later that this was Eduardo Gonzalez Quirarte.''

General Angeles also strongly denied a claim made by General Gutierrez Rebollo during his trial that Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte had two other meetings and that he paid a $6 million down payment on a promised gratuity of $60 million to Government officials.

''You can be fully certain that had he done that, he would have been arrested because that is bribery,'' General Angeles said.

Referring to General Gutierrez Rebollo, he added, ''That is characteristic of his accusations -- the lies, the infamy, the slander.''

One current and one former American official said there was credible information that Mr. Gonzalez Quirarte had been to see military officials more than once, and they added that a recent assessment of General Gutierrez Rebollo's testimony concluded that much of it was true."
33,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"In the story of how Russia's markets collapsed in May, give at least a couple of paragraphs to a simple mistake by a provincial government aide.

It happened that Lawrence Summers, America's top international-finance official, was in Moscow in mid-May when worries growing out of renewed Asian troubles were rising, and Mr. Summers requested a meeting with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. But an aide to the youthful new prime minister, hailing from Mr. Kiriyenko's hometown 250 miles east of Moscow, knew only that this Mr. Summers was a deputy secretary of the treasury -- a title unworthy of an audience with a Russian prime minister.

Word leaked out that the two had failed to meet. Then, an International Monetary Fund team left town without agreeing with Russia on a 1998 austerity plan. Investors, already nervous that the country would be unable to pay its debts, feared a rift between Russia and its Western government financiers, despite public support by Mr. Summers for Russia's efforts. Over the next two weeks, a bad situation worsened, as ruble-holders rushed to convert to dollars, stock prices plunged, and a nearpanic brought Russia to the brink.

A look at how the crisis unfolded shows how long-brewing financial troubles combined with misunderstandings, bungled policy initiatives and unfortunate coincidences to undermine the Russian economy.

The nation has pulled back from the precipice, in part by successfully selling $1.25 billion of new Eurobonds and bringing down interest rates somewhat. The Central Bank yesterday slashed its overnight lending rate for banks to 60% from the sky-high 150% set a week earlier, and yields on one-year government bonds fell 6 1/2 percentage points to 48%. While plenty of disarray remains, Russia has recently put on an unusual display of coordination between the government, the Central Bank and the Kremlin.

Still, investors say the country is likely to need a support package worth billions of dollars from the West to emerge from its current financial hole, and it has to convince the world it has learned some lessons. Russia will need to show that its new promises of reform, such as to pass and implement a new tax code, are real. For this latest Russian crisis, while punctuated by things as simple as the misunderstanding involving Mr. Summers, is rooted more deeply: in a changed global outlook toward emerging nations, and in Moscow's repeated failures to follow through on reform pledges.

When the emerging markets of the world were flush, Asian nations got by on their track record of growth and Russia got by on good intentions. That no longer cuts it with global investors. Since the Asian debacle, they are more demanding, says Dirk Damrau, head of research at the Moscow brokerage firm MFK Renaissance. ""And Russia has been found lacking,"" he says.

That is clear from the way investors, domestic and international, have punished Russia this spring. Its stock market, which skyrocketed in 1996 and part of 1997, is down 48% so far this year. For the month of May, it fell 39%. That puts stocks just above where they were in a frightening period two years ago before President Boris Yeltsin defeated a Communist candidate and won re-election.

Amid the latest crisis, government-bond yields briefly soared above 70% annually. The still-lofty rates threaten that unless investors come back into the bond market and drive down yields, the finance ministry will bankrupt itself paying interest. Already, a third of government revenue goes to interest, and billions of dollars in obligations are due in the coming months.

Until the most recent troubles in Asia -- riots in Indonesia, more evidence of Japan's deep ennui, a nuclear race on the Indian subcontinent -- Russia appeared to have escaped the ravages of the Asian monetary maelstrom. Its notoriously poor tax collection was improving. Economic data showed growth for the first time in seven years. Credit Suisse First Boston declared the country a buy. Boris Jordan, an American who has become one of the biggest players in Russia's stock market, went on vacation to Disney World.

Then all hell broke loose. Here is how it happened.

Russia's May crisis is broadly rooted in global conditions, but it traces as well to some blunders here in Moscow.

As markets around the globe stumbled in October, the Russian Central Bank made what many consider a critical mistake: Instead of defending the currency, it used reserves to intervene in the bond market to hold down interest rates. The end result was to wipe out a significant part of the country's gold and cash reserves.

Still, Russia experienced only collateral damage in the fall and winter. The government, then headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, issued a series of reform pledges. Investors gave Russia a second chance. The ruble held steady, and yields on one-year government bonds, after rising as high as 40%, settled back below 30% by year end. The Russian stock market's fourth-quarter drop, while a jolting 21%, was little more than a dip compared with the butchery in some emerging markets.

Investors were reassured by news that the Russian gross domestic product, on the wane for seven years, actually rose slightly in 1997. The Communist-dominated parliament, known as the Duma, passed a budget that many thought was the most realistic ever, calling for spending cuts and a smaller deficit.

Indeed, in the first quarter of 1998, the deficit held to its target of below 4.6% of GDP, far smaller than the 8.1% of GDP a year earlier. In May, MFK Renaissance said that ""since the end of January, more progress has been made on improving Russia's fiscal prospect than in the whole of 1997."" The firm planned a lavish investor conference at the end of May, with entertainment by traditional folk dancers and champion U.S. jet-skiers.

Sensing Russia had escaped the emerging-market uncertainties posed by Asia's troubles, Mr. Yeltsin fired his entire government, including Mr. Chernomyrdin, the 60-year-old prime minister who had waxed hot and cold on market reforms in his six-year tenure. Mr. Yeltsin brought in Mr. Kiriyenko, a young, untested former banker who had been in government less than a year. The move boded well for the future, assuming the 35-year-old had time to get up to speed.

He didn't.

Mr. Kiriyenko's approval in late April was the last good day the Russian stock market would see for a while. Asia Again Just as Mr. Kiriyenko was forming his government, the Asian crisis was heating up again. Financial markets grew concerned that the U.S. Federal Reserve would tighten interest rates in response to strong U.S. growth. ""The interest-rate story changed the bias of the marketplace,"" says Phillip Hildebrand, global strategist for Moore Capital Management in New York. With higher rates from the Fed, emerging-market debt could go nowhere but down. He recommended that his investment firm sell, among other assets, some of its Russian debt.

Unsettling news piled up. Riots erupted in Indonesia, and then the Suharto government fell. Rumors circulated of a German interest-rate increase. Credit agencies downgraded Korean banks. India shocked the world by conducting nuclear tests.

""Russia got attacked when Asia came back,"" says Zoran Konstantinovic, vice president at ED&F Man Global Markets Inc. in New York. ""People's appetite for risk was shrinking, and they looked around at countries most likely to be affected.""

The response wasn't merciless. The Russian stocks began to fall, but bond investors actually gave Russia two weeks to calm them down.

The opportunity, investors say, was missed. P.R. Stumbles The first in a series of public-relations gaffes began in early May. Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin warned government ministers of a debt crisis looming within three years, a responsible thing for a central banker to inform ministers about. But the Russian press was in attendance. ""Of course, it was not said for public consumption,"" says Sergei Alexashenko, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank.

That same week, while the Russian stock market was tumbling, Mr. Yeltsin had to sign a law limiting foreign ownership of Unified Energy Systems, the national electric-power monopoly and one of the country's few blue-chip stocks. The Duma had overridden his veto. Stocks fell further.

More jitters ensued when statements by Mr. Dubinin, the Central Bank chairman, were misinterpreted to mean the bank was considering devaluing the ruble. He actually was just restating bank policy, but investors' focus shifted to the currency's stability.

The miscues continued. Prime Minister Kiriyenko, in one of his first interviews, disclosed that tax revenue was 26% below target. Saying so was part of a policy change, to be frank and open. ""We must realize that we're not wealthy enough,"" he said. ""Moreover, we must honestly say that we're quite poor now.""

The two-week-old government was in fact making plans to slash spending and raise revenue, but that word was never communicated adequately. ""They did all they could,"" says Evegeny Yuriev, president of Aton, a Russian brokerage firm. ""The only thing they undervalued was the value of P.R.""

By the end of the second week in May, word had leaked out that the IMF and Russia were at odds over how to cut spending. Some investors within Russia also had heard that Mr. Summers of the U.S. had come and gone without seeing the prime minister. A lot of people started putting two and two together. Right afterward, some big investors ""started to sell their [government-bond] portfolios and all Russian securities,"" says the Central Bank's Mr. Alexashenko. The following Monday, May 18, yields on government bonds soared to 47% as some investors bailed out.

The reaction caused Mr. Jordan, head of MFK Renaissance, significant concern. Normally, with inflation running below 10%, at least some Russian banks would step in to take the government paper at such high rates. Their poor appetite for the bonds was an ominous sign of a local lack of confidence and a liquidity problem in the banking system.

The reason for the lack of liquidity is just one of the ironies of the Russian crisis. It was in part the result of much-needed reforms that, at another time, would have been lauded by investors. ""The crisis hit us exactly . . . when a number of good things have been happening,"" says Aleksei Mozhin, Russia's delegate to the IMF.

The government in 1998 had eliminated tax offsets-paper issued by government agencies to pay for goods and services, which the recipients could use to reduce their tax bills. Without offsets, banks and other companies had to come up with more cash to pay taxes, and that reduced liquidity. ""They were doing all the right thingsthat's what makes this so irritating,"" says Jim Nail, senior analyst in London for Soros Global Research.

Another policy change also hurt. For years, the government had used commercial banks to pay its bills. Last year, it moved to a U.S.-style treasury system, with branches of its own. The change saved money, reduced corruption and made payments more timely. But an unforeseen result was a fall in the cash moving through banks that these banks once used to play the government bond market.

So when the crunch hit, the Russian banks couldn't help.

It can never be known whether Russia could have halted the forces gathering against its markets, but it might have had one last chance in the third week of May. When markets began to drop on Monday, May 18, the Central Bank responded by jacking up its lending rate for banks to 50% from 30%. It used $1 billion of its scarce reserves within two days trying to defend the ruble. The moves, Mr. Alexashenko concedes, were ""still not enough.""

An IMF team had landed in Moscow that week to complete negotiations with the government on resuming the country's $9 billion loan program with the fund. A deal would have been the first real good news. But the two sides couldn't come to agreement, and the team left. ""This was interpreted as a sign of significant disagreement with the fund,"" says Mr. Mozhin, Russia's delegate to the IMF. An IMF official says the fund had little choice; substantial differences remained, and the fund wasn't going to lie about it.

It was only by Monday the 25th that the Central Bank appeared to realize there was a major loss of investor confidence in Russia. By then, events had a momentum of their own. Demand for government bonds plunged; their yields leapt above 50%.

By Wednesday the 27th, the situation was out of control. The government failed to sell enough bonds at its weekly auction to refinance debt coming due. In the baroque palace in the center of Moscow that is the Central Bank's headquarters, an emergency meeting was convened. A Breather The directors gathered and, for what appeared to be the first time, made a decision that would put the them ahead of the crisis. At first there was debate, but then an obscure board member, the head of the bank's legal department, made a shocking proposal: Raise the Central Bank's lending rate to commercial banks by 100 percentage points, to 150%.

There was silence, Mr. Alexashenko recalls. Then opposition. Then realization that it was the only feasible course.

The Kiriyenko government also began to understand the need for concerted action. It formed and publicized an anticrisis plan and began rare bankruptcy procedures against three companies with significant debts for back taxes. It dispatched Anatoly Chubais, well known in the West as the man behind many of Russia's most significant economic reforms, to Washington to sound out the West about assistance. The prime minister began meeting with foreign investors to reassure them.

The Clinton administration lent a hand by pledging to support an international aid package for Russia, although not promising any U.S. funds.

At this past Wednesday's bond auction, the Russian Central Bank held a firm line on interest rates. And the finance ministry in late afternoon took a gamble and gave Goldman, Sachs & Co. the go-ahead to sell the $1.25 billion in bonds. They sold in 25 minutes.

President Yeltsin, who sometimes disappears in a crisis, also got in on the act. He appeared nightly on Russian television and summoned the nation's financial elite to a well-publicized Kremlin meeting, jawboning them to invest in Russia. He fired the head of the state tax service and brought in Boris Fyodorov, the outspoken former finance minister known as an economic reformer.

All of this, some Russia experts say, just gives Russia breathing room. Without significant progress quickly, panic could come again as quickly as the recent stability has set in.

By the end of this September alone, $2.5 billion to $3 billion in loans from foreign lenders to Russian corporations and banks come due. If those loans aren't renewed, there could be another run on the ruble. Billions of dollars in ruble futures, used to hedge investments in rubles, will also mature by the fall.

The plan at the moment is to raise about $10 billion, but the source is unclear. In the past few days, the Russian government has said it doesn't want additional assistance from the IMF and would prefer to go to the public markets for the moneyanother attempt to show its confidence. The objective is to replace short-term Russian debt with long-term Eurobonds, which are denominated in dollars.

Still, Group of Seven finance officials are scheduled to meet in Paris next week to discuss Russian aid. They are likely to be asking the same question that is on the mind of investors: whether this time the Russian government means it when it talks about reform, or whether the recent pledges are one-time promises to muddle through the crisis.

""In the past, they would get themselves through the crisis and then relax,"" says Vladimir Potanin, one of the country's wealthiest businessmen. ""This government will not have that opportunity."""
34,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"For seven years, the West has spent billions of dollars propping up Russia's economy and financial markets.

Yesterday, after months of tremors, that financial system buckled badly. Now, the world is wondering whether billions more are needed, where it would come from and whether it would do any good.

Russia's stock, bond and currency markets all snapped amid investor fears that the government would default on its domestic debt, devalue the ruble or do both. Trading froze as banks and brokers refused each other's business. Annual yields on ruble-denominated bonds soared to more than 200% from 150% as even the hardiest investors shunned the risk. The stock market had to be closed for 35 minutes as prices crashed. It ended down 6.5% on little volume because stocks simply couldn't be traded. So far this year, it has lost more than 75% of its value.

But the fears surrounding Russian markets go well beyond investors or the country's borders. From Washington to Bonn to London, world leaders are treating the crisis as their own.

Just five weeks after President Clinton helped Russia get a $22.6 billion aid package led by the International Monetary Fund -- one of several multibillion-dollar loan programs that the U.S. has spearheaded this decade -- his administration was busy yesterday figuring out what could be done now to avert more-serious problems.

Of course, the country's markets could snap back, as they have before, when Russia and the West have agreed upon combined action. Despite its current problems, the country has made considerable strides toward capitalism -- privatizing its state-run industries, inviting foreign investment, developing bond and stock markets and controlling hyperinflation. Investors had rewarded that progress by buying the country's securities. Just last year, in fact, Russia was the world's best-performing emerging market.

The need for action prompted high-level officials of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to hold an emergency conference call yesterday to discuss Russia's plight, which has become the Clinton administration's main economic worry. Said White House spokesman Michael McCurry: ""It's critical that the Russian government act quickly to restore confidence in their economy.""

U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David Lipton met in Moscow with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to determine whether Russia has the political resolve to salvage itself. The U.S. administration, facing a skeptical Congress, is skittish about discussing new money if Russia doesn't show that it can take drastic measures. Indeed, the past few weeks, during which the IMF has poured in $4.8 billion, have shown U.S. officials that the money goes out nearly as quickly as it has come in.

The main concern in Washington is that the lack of confidence about Russia will spread beyond its borders and be picked up by investors in Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, among other locales. After multibillion-dollar bailouts in Russia, Indonesia and South Korea, the IMF worries that it doesn't have the money to prop up other fallen economies.

And lurking not far beneath the surface, as it has since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, is concern about Russian political stability, the future of the Yeltsin government and the safety of the country's thousands of nuclear weapons.

Says Anders Aslund, a former adviser to the Russian government who now is at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington: ""This is a situation when you have to act fast.""

Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded Russia's foreign-currency debt, its banks and its local governments. The credit-rating agency cited ""Russia's mounting liquidity problems, compounded by the banking crisis, and the likelihood that sharp declines in output and living standards will weaken domestic support for the Yeltsin administration's economic-reform program.""

Much of the worry stems from the belief among some that Russia won't be able to muddle through this time, that it has only two choices: sharply devalue the ruble or default on some of its debt. Neither option bodes well. Devaluation would bring the crisis home to the Russian people, who so far have been spared its worst effects. The ability to purchase foreign goods is one of the benefits of post-Soviet economic reform. Devaluation would make even simple foreign products too expensive for the average Russian, who sees the stability of the currency as one of the few tangible fruits of more than six years of economic reform.

Devaluation might bring some immediate relief to major exporters such as oil companies and would reduce the cost of servicing ruble-denominated debt, but it would badly dent the government's credibility -- and President Boris Yeltsin's as well.

The central bank has repeatedly said it won't devalue the ruble. Irina Yasina, the central bank's chief spokesperson, contends that no one would benefit. ""It wouldn't increase tax revenues, it wouldn't stimulate exports,"" she says. ""It would lead only to social conflicts and inflation.""

Defaulting on the debt -- put more politely, restructuring -- would buy Russia time. It would reduce the demands on its dwindling $17 billion in reserves and already-overstretched budget. But it would diminish the confidence of investors, both foreign and Russian, who will be needed to dig the country out of its deep hole.

A default would likely push Russia into recession and restrict its access to foreign capital for several years. The most likely form a default would take would be a declaration by the Kremlin that it would convert part of its $60 billion in short-term domestic debt into longer-term debt -- but at sharply reduced interest rates. The amount most likely to be restructured is the $18 billion of high-interest government debt that is estimated to come due by year end.

There is no talk of Russia defaulting on its $135 billion in foreign-currency obligations, much of which was restructured in the past several years, opening the way for Russia's return to foreign capital markets.

Nevertheless, say banking experts, foreign investors would likely avoid the Russian market after any kind of default, and capital flight by domestic investors would surge. Moreover, foreign banks would be unlikely to renew their credit lines with Russian banks. Short of the foreign exchange needed to purchase imports, Russia would risk recession.

Yet, a default probably wouldn't hurt Russia as severely as it did Mexico in 1982. Mexico essentially was unable to borrow on foreign markets for nearly eight years. Russia isn't likely to face that severe a consequence because it isn't as indebted as Mexico was. And the U.S. and other major industrial powers may feel more pressure to help Russia mend its finances than they did Mexico.

Marcel Cassard, a former IMF Russia specialist, says an additional $15 billion loan package is needed. Russia has ""enough money to hold on for a few months,"" says Mr. Cassard, who now is Deutsche Bank's chief economist for Russia, ""but there isn't enough money to create a level of comfort.""

But the chances of putting together such a package are slim, especially if it calls for substantial funding from the U.S. and other major powers. The U.S. Congress, which is already hesitant to provide additional funding to the IMF, is likely to balk at yet another Russia package, especially because the Russians haven't carried out the terms of the one announced in July. That's why officials of the U.S., Germany and IMF have urged the Russians to adopt measures that would improve tax collection and overhaul the tax code, which are viewed as the minimum requirement to gain credibility.

How did Russia get in such a mess?

The easy answer, but not necessarily the most complete one, is dithering on economic reform and rampant corruption. But U.S. officials note that, while all that may be true, much of what troubles Russia has been outside its control. In fits and starts, the country has been trying to transform itself from a military-command economy to something resembling capitalism. Oil-export dollars and revenue from the country's other considerable commodities were going to pay for this transformation.

But this year, the bottom dropped out of commodity markets world-wide, with oil taking one of the biggest hits. Russia may have lost as much as $4 billion in revenue this year from lower oil prices alone, a number, coincidentally or not, that is close to what the IMF has disbursed from the latest loan package

In addition, the Asian economic crisis forced emerging-markets investors to monitor their investments closely, and Russia's messy political and economic foundation didn't hold up under scrutiny. In the spring and summer, the country's markets began to drop, and the IMF stepped in to lead a $22.6 billion loan package secured by promises that Russia would crack down on widespread tax evasion and step up privatization, among other measures.

But the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament, went on vacation after gutting crucial parts of an anticrisis program endorsed by the IMF. The government asked lawmakers to reconvene, but the Duma refused.

President Yeltsin has signed a raft of decrees to try to repair the damage, but Duma assent is still needed to enact a new tax code.

With Asia's markets falling again and Russia's response uncertain, the dam burst yesterday. Investors said their concern about devaluation was heightened by a letter, published yesterday in the Financial Times, from multibillionaire George Soros, one of the biggest investors in Russia. He proposed a ""modest devaluation"" of 15% to 25%, coupled with creation of a currency board to hold the ruble's value steady. He also proposed that the G-7 countries support Russia with billions more in reserves.

A major problem has been that Russia's political leaders didn't seem to understand the dire straits the country was in. When the market seizure hit, many top officials, including the central-bank chairman, Sergei Dubinin, were on vacation.

Mr. Yeltsin also is on vacation and has said nothing in public. Prime Minister Kiriyenko appeared briefly on television, but only to reiterate that the government will press on with a reform package agreed upon with the IMF last month. Still, many top officials ""don't fully understand how domestic developments get linked to international events -- and how quickly capital moves,"" the senior U.S. official said.

They learned it yesterday if they didn't know it already. Russia's markets didn't just drop; they virtually ground to a halt. Volume on the Russian Trading System, which last year reached as high as $200 million a day, was a mere $10 million yesterday in a market with a capitalization of about $18 billion. Only about five of 51 issues saw any significant trading. Brokers, fearing other brokers could go bankrupt, refused to deal.

""We're not participating in this madness,"" said Dan Rapoport, director of sales at the CentreInvest brokerage in Moscow.

The market malaise has also exposed the weaknesses of Russia's commercial banks, many of which have built their fortunes on risky investments and large portfolios of high-yielding government debt. Now that the debt has depreciated to default levels, the banks are left without a source of ready cash, and this week some began reneging on their debts. As a result, Russian banks no longer trust each other, refusing to lend money or make currency deals. Western banks that have lent money to the Russians on the collateral of dollar denominated bonds are demanding payments, known as margin calls, to make up for the loss in value of the collateral. Some Russian banks haven't met the calls, and the Western creditors have liquidated the collateral, fueling a drop in prices.

Yesterday, Moody's Investors Services downgraded its long-term foreign-currency deposit ratings for 11 Russian banks. German banks have also been rocked by Russia's troubles because their Russian exposure dwarfs that of other lenders. German banks have about $30.5 billion in exposure to Russia -- about 13% of their total capital -- compared with only $7.1 billion for U.S. banks and $7 billion for French banks. Some German bank stocks fell as much as 4% before recovering toward the end of the day.

However, Matthew Czepliewicz, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, says investors are overreacting. For one thing, more than half of the German loans are either on the books of public-sector banks or are guaranteed by the German government. Besides, Deutsche Bank AG, Dresdner Bank and the others have already set aside reserves of 60 cents on the dollar for the portion of their Russian loans not guaranteed by the German government.

The only thing yet to plummet in Russia's markets is the ruble. Over the past few weeks, the central bank has spent nearly $2 billion of its precious international reserves to prop up the currency. Fearing an attack on the ruble, the central bank yesterday tightened emergency controls on currency trading, demanding that commercial banks prove that they are buying dollars for clients and not for their own accounts. Nonetheless, the ruble yesterday was trading at 6.4 to the dollar, below the target value set by the central bank."
35,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"The Bratsk Aluminum Plant trumpeted its good news: a hefty $37 million profit. Then, nudged by auditors from Arthur Andersen, it mumbled a melancholy coda: Well, actually, the plant had a $7.4 million loss.

Puzzled? Foreign investors certainly are. So, too, are some of Russia's most numerically nimble minds.

Moscow has the gloss of a modern economy: financial markets, shopping malls and a burgeoning demand for exotic pets and psychiatrists. At the foundations, though, lie some very soggy numbers. Profits dissolve into phantoms; losses metamorphose into earnings. It all depends on who is doing the counting. A year ago, the muddle hardly seemed to matter; Russia had the world's best-performing emerging stock market.

Today, Cinderella's coach is again a pumpkin. Russia's market is down 77% so far this year and among the world's worst performers. Now, the swings in the ruble's value make it all the more difficult for multinational companies to assess the books in Russia. And the muddle over numbers has never mattered more.

While baffled investors scratch their heads, arithmetic contortions that enable companies to make and lose money simultaneously are vexing some of Russia's premier computer programmers as they try to write software that can straddle the two systems. ""Russian profits are different from Western-style profits. The same data can give different results,"" says Sergei Nuraliev, head of the accounting-software department of 1C, a Russian computer company. ""It gets very complicated. . . . Translation is sometimes difficult.""

In a rented annex of Goskomstat, or the State Statistics Committee, 1C designs software to help companies convert their raw financial data into two, often contradictory sets of accounts: one Russian and one Western. The proximity to Goskomstat, custodian of Russia's gross domestic product and other major economic indicators, is perhaps less than auspicious: Its chief statistician was arrested in June for allegedly doctoring production figures.

""It is absolutely incredible that after this number of years, the system of accounting is largely unreformed,"" says Trevor Link of the Arthur Andersen office in Moscow. ""It fit the Soviet era very well, but was never designed to account for things like profit.""

The Finance Ministry wants this changed. So does the International Monetary Fund, which last month put together a $22.6 billion assistance package for Russia in return for promises of reform, including changes in accounting. Another powerful impetus is individual Russian companies' hunger for foreign money. Investors, tired by being mauled in Moscow's markets, want to see books they can trust.

The dry arcana of accounting has become the unlikely battleground for a critical struggle over Russia's economic future. Most of Russia's major oil companies, its natural-gas monopoly, RAO Gazprom, and some other large corporations have begun producing Western-style financial statements, in addition to statutory Russian accounts. But the vast majority of enterprises in Russia -- and in other former Soviet republics -- stick to the old ways. For Russia to integrate into the global economy, beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union, they also must change.

More often than not, the task of counting the money still falls to people such as Nadezhda Belobrovkina, chief accountant at the Moscow Electrode Factory. She learned her trade more than 20 years ago and keeps punctilious records by hand in a big white ledger. The crumbling factory has trouble paying its staff of about 1,500, has fallen heavily into debt -- including millions of rubles in unpaid energy bills -- but, according to Ms. Belobrovkina's calculations, still turns a profit. How? ""This is a commercial secret,"" says the plant's director, Nikolai Ovchinnikov.

Mrs. Belobrovkina has never bothered with International Accounting Standards nor heard of the even-stricter Generally Accepted Accounting Principles used in the U.S. But she fantasizes about what they might bring: ""I hear that accountants in the West go to work only once or twice a week. If such a system were introduced here, we would be very happy.""

Russia's Chart of Accounts, the framework for corporate bookkeeping, dates from November 1991, just weeks before the Soviet Union fell apart. Since then, it has been patched up with laws, decrees and instructions, cataloged in a twice-monthly journal. But the grip of a fundamental Soviet-era principle remains firm: The purpose of accounts is to help the state -- formerly the central planners and now the tax police -- stop people from stealing by keeping tabs on inventories, -- not to help managers develop their businesses.

Soviet accountants served as the state's quartermasters. In a system driven by production rather than profit, they tracked the flow of inputs and outputs, heedless of whether value had been added or subtracted, money made or lost. But instead of perishing with the Soviet Union, homo sovieticus, that species peculiar to the decrepit Communist system, still lingers on in offices cluttered with carbon paper, dog-eared files and clunky adding machines.

Some younger Russians are appalled. In March, Rusaudit, a Moscow-based Russian auditing firm, sent economist Aleksandr Voiskoboinikov to review the accounts of a paper company in Perm, on the western edge of Siberia. The records for an entire year had vanished, and those that remained were of little help. ""The chief accountant started drinking at noon, so we tried to catch her before 11 o'clock,"" he says. After interviewing staffers about dimly remembered barter deals and offbook transactions, Mr. Voiskoboinikov produced a report. But he admits he had little idea what was really going on.

The rot in Russian numbers starts at the top. Figures have always been a negotiable and frequently friable commodity. In the Soviet era, the State Statistics Committee pumped out dubious data. The agency has since been reorganized and stripped of responsibility for former Soviet territory outside Russia, but its data remain dubious. Authorities allege that its former chief, Yuri Yurkov, arrested in June, skewed the numbers on factory production and the like to help companies avoid taxes and sold confidential information. Investigators say they found about $1 million in cash and a trove of jewelry in his home. Mr. Yurkov, who unsuccessfully appealed his arrest, now is awaiting trial on corruption charges.

Pervasive mistrust undermines what in the West are the basic building blocks of bookkeeping. Soviet central planners, wary of giving accountants freedoms they might abuse, banned them, in effect, from thinking for themselves. Instead of allowing accountants to set depreciation rates according to real wear-and-tear, for example, the state published a weighty tome dictating the lifespan of everything from wooden chairs to machine tools. The index has been simplified, but state-set formulas still inhibit accurate evaluation of fixed assets and discourage replacement of obsolete equipment and buildings. Western accountants set the useful life of most buildings at less than 30 years; in Russia, they are decreed to last up to 100.

One company struggling to straddle the two systems is Bratsk Aluminum, Russia's biggest aluminum smelter. The chasm between Western and Russian accounting measures, between what the company's Russian accountants say it earned in 1997 and what Arthur Andersen says it lost, exceeds $44 million. ""This loss is purely artificial,"" says Arkady Gaukhman, the plant's chief accountant. ""I don't know where he is coming from,"" replies Marcus Rhodes, head of Arthur Andersen's audit-advisory division in Moscow. ""The loss recorded in the financial statement is the loss as audited.""

Arthur Andersen estimated Bratsk's depreciation at $56.3 million; Bratsk put the figure at only $19.4 million. Bratsk said its buildings last 40 to 50 years; Arthur Andersen put their useful life at 15 to 30 years. The Western and Russian versions of Bratsk's performance also diverge on estimates of doubtful debt, inventory reserves and subsidiaries' earnings.

Similar muddles bedevil Russian banking. Just as factories here keep obsolete equipment on their books far longer than those in the West, Russian banks do the same with dodgy loans. The Central Bank is trying to change this and is pressuring the banks to disclose the true state of their finances. Among reforms endorsed by the IMF is a requirement that, starting next year, all financial institutions report consolidated results. The move is designed to stop them from playing shell games with their bad loans.

Barnacled by the past, Russian accounting impedes the way business works in a market-driven economy. The Soviet system never really bothered with advertising or to account for costs of employee training or business travel. Today, such costs are an important part of doing business here but require elaborate arithmetic gymnastics to satisfy the tax collectors. Instead of regarding them as normal business costs, authorities see them more as camouflage for possible tax fraud and put strict and bafflingly complex limits on deductions. The Finance Ministry says a new tax code will help correct this flaw.

The Soviet legacy also prevents a clear reckoning of the money many Russian enterprises still spend on staff housing, clinics, kindergartens and other services. Russian accountants usually bury such ""social costs"" in murky ""special purpose"" funds that can take Western auditors months to unravel.

The confusion underscores a sobering fact. Communism collapsed seven years ago in Russia, but the transition to capitalism remains a chaotic work-in-progresss. ""Change the name of the country, change the flag, change the border. Yes, this was done overnight,"" says Bruce Bean, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow. ""But build a market economy, introduce a meaningful tax system, create new accounting rules, accept the concept that companies which cannot compete should go bankrupt and the workers there lose their jobs? These things take time."""
36,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"Away from the mayhem in Moscow, Igor Sizov, director of the Kostroma Textile Machinery Design Bureau, has more urgent matters to worry about: 6,000 pairs of thick woolen socks for the local police department.

No money will change hands. In the economic twilight zone inhabited by most Russians, it rarely does. Instead of rubles, Mr. Sizov will get a reprieve.

The deal is simple. Kostroma's police, among the millions who get paid late or never, will get warm toes. In return, they will take the heat off Mr. Sizov's decrepit plant over its unpaid taxes. ""This is not a solution,"" says Mr. Sizov, ""it is just a way to keep going.""

But in which direction? Behind all the sound and fury in Moscow -- where the ruble, government debt and now the government itself have been cast to the wind -- lies a fundamental question about Russia: Is this market capitalism as it emerges from its chrysalis or the survival mechanism of a system unable to embrace real market forces?

In the saga of the socks lurks the dead soul of Russia's economy. The deal helps police to patrol the streets, and the Textile Machinery Design Bureau to stagger on. But, along with countless similar transactions, it hobbles Russia's clubfooted transition to capitalism.

Mr. Sizov's plant can't sell its products, it can't pay its taxes, it can't pay its electricity bills, and it often can't pay its workers. (They, too, get stuck with socks.) But like tens of thousands of crumbling Russian enterprises, it has survived, just.

Protected from the harsh discipline of money and markets, it finds shelter from bankruptcy in a ruble-free zone of barter, debt and favors. This sanctuary has saved Russia from mass unemployment, but it has dulled the promise, along with the pain, of the market.

A government report dissecting Russia's deformed economic anatomy calls it ""Syndrome X."" The International Monetary Fund refers to it coyly as Russia's ""structural agenda."" Clifford Gaddy, a Brookings Institution authority on Russian industry, dubs it ""the virtual economy.""

An official survey of 210 enterprises at the backbone of the economy estimated that barter, debt-swaps and other nonmonetary deals accounted for 73% of transactions in 1996 and 1997. The businesses surveyed paid only 8% of their taxes with real -- what Russians call ""live"" -- money.

An announcement yesterday by the central bank that it would curtail support for the rapidly dropping ruble will add another layer of unreality. The withering of Russia's currency, while making it easier for companies to pay off their bills and debts, is likely to further entrench barter.

For this surreal system to survive, however, every link in the chain must hold firm. In Moscow, markets and the government buckled under the strain. And in Kostroma, too, the chain is badly fatigued; city hall went dark for several days this summer. Across Russia, a showdown looms. The outcome will decide whether taxes, bills and wages get paid and whether the discipline of live money takes hold.

Until last week, foreign investors stood aloof from such woes. The markets were tumbling, but the causes seemed to lie elsewhere. Today, investors have been sucked into the virtual economy. They, too, might not get much more than socks. Last Friday, Sergei Kiriyenko, then prime minister, told parliament: ""We are getting rid of a disease. It is called the habit of living in debt."" Two days later, President Boris Yeltsin got rid of Mr. Kiriyenko.

The disease has spread to every vital organ, from the central government in Moscow to factories across the country. All live in debt. Workers are owed more than $11 billion in unpaid wages -- equal to what the IMF pledged in new loans to Russia for the entire year. The electricity network, RAO Unified Energy Systems, or UES, owes the government at least five billion to six billion rubles but says it is owed twice this by deadbeat customers. RAO Gazprom, Russia's natural-gas monopoly, owes 12 billion rubles in back taxes but says it is owed 13 billion itself.

""The blood of industry is cash,"" says Yuri Filippov, head of the Kostroma region's industry department. ""There is not blood in our veins."" Without money there are no real prices; without prices there can be no effective market.

Kostroma, 200 miles northeast of Moscow, has a peculiar relationship with cash. Five years ago, when the government canceled all Soviet-era money, it chose the region as the graveyard for notes bearing Lenin's portrait. A cavalcade of trucks lumbered through the city, carrying coffins of cash to a ballistic-missile base outside town. Billions of old rubles now sit rotting at the bottom of unused silos.

The region's Communist-backed governor, Viktor Shershunov, declares the cash-clogged missile silos an environmental danger and laments the irony: The place is jammed with useless rubles even as ""our biggest headache is getting money."" He hasn't had his power cut off yet but has taken precautions. ""We have a stock of candles ready,"" he says.

The problem for Kostroma, and the country as a whole, is that while the currency of Lenin's realm has been buried, the economic system it oiled still rumbles on. Factories have been put in private hands, but not into a real market.

In the main workshop of Mr. Sizov's plant, a handful of men hammer chunks of metal in semidarkness. The lights are off to save money. Unable to sell the machine technology it was set up to develop for the Soviet Union, the plant now makes primitive spare parts, mostly nuts, bolts and washers. Payment for them clogs corridors and offices: plastic bags stuffed with wool from a textile mill in Uzbekistan; heaps of blankets from a Moscow manufacturer; a mountain of tablecloths and heaps of flax from a linen combine.

The flight from money began as a rational response to hyperinflation. Back in 1992, it made sense to accept solid goods, not withering rubles. But the habit became a crippling addiction.

Now, Russia's newly reinstated prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, faces a critical decision: Feed the addiction or force cold turkey. His past makes the former more likely. As prime minister from 1992 until March, he nurtured the debt habit. Earlier, he ran Gazprom, the biggest pusher of economic painkillers.

Last year, Gazprom's Russian customers paid only 15% of their bills with cash, covering the rest with IOUs and barter. Gazprom, in turn, begged off paying taxes. Moscow has tried this year to halt the cycle. It told all companies to pay federal taxes with money. From Moscow to Magadan in the East, the virtual economy shuddered. And, in Kostroma, the lights went out in city hall.

Gazprom's domestic gas supplier, Mezhregiongaz, had passed the pressure to pay on to its local customers. In Kostroma, this meant KostromaEnergo, a branch of the UES electricity network. It acknowledged owing 173 million rubles for gas but said it couldn't pay until it got paid itself-by Mr. Sizov, by the police, by bureaucrats and by other customers.

Mezhregiongaz refused to budge. In May, it turned off the power company's gas. The power company got some fuel from a neighboring region that owed it a debt, but when that ran out it pulled the plug on city apparatchiks. ""I warned them,"" says its director, Yuri Nazarov. ""It was very simple: Pay up or we'll cut off your power.""

Simple, but also revolutionary. ""I've worked in this business for 37 years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened,"" he says, waving sheaves of paper listing his deadbeat customers. So novel is the notion of mandatory payment that the main power station last year raised output by 46%, while consumers paid only 1.8% of their bills with money.

At city hall, the lights went off, computers crashed and bureaucrats scurried to the canteen, the only room left with power. The mayor, Boris Korobov, rushed back from a trip and sent an SOS to the military. Russia's strategic rocket forces came to the rescue: The local commander provided an emergency generator. ""Nobody likes this mess,"" the mayor says. ""This is not the market. It is the Middle Ages.""

After three days, the power came back on. Municipal authorities agreed to pay up in part. Gas and electricity companies reshuffled the pack of unpaid invoices. Gas supplies resumed. But while the blackout has left much bitterness, it solved nothing. The spiral of debts and counterdebts has begun again.

This Monday, KostromaEnergo struck a deal with Mr. Sizov's textile-machinery plant for 50,000 rubles' worth of electricity. ""We didn't have to pay a single kopeck,"" said Alexander Dobrokhodov, the plant's deputy director. In return for power, the factory is giving 400 woolen blankets to a camp for handicapped children. Their value will be deducted from KostromaEnergo's local taxes, just as the socks for the local police will wipe out part of the machinery plant's own municipal tax bill.

And why does Mr. Sizov have blankets? He got them from a Moscow factory, in return for deliveries of wool, which he earlier got from a textile factory in Uzbekistan in return for equipment.

Meanwhile, the Kostromskie Vedomosty newspaper has just sold off the last of hundreds of linen sheets and pillowcases that for months cluttered its offices. It got them in return for money it had on deposit with a bank that closed after one of Mr. Sizov's old customers, the Big Linen Manufacturer, failed to repay a loan.

Under the socks and blankets hides both the tenacity and decrepitude of the past. The Kostroma Textile Machinery Design Bureau was once a flower of Soviet industry. It never had to look for customers: They were assigned. Today, ""nobody is interested in buying my equipment,"" Mr. Sizov says. ""All my customers are in a deep crisis. Their products cannot compete.""

In a market economy, they and he would be out of business. A new bankruptcy law will encourage that, but only a tiny fraction of the estimated 800,000 technically bankrupt companies are expected to file. And even those that do rarely close. For some, the new law allows up to 10 years in court-administered limbo.

More important is political will: Can government embrace a discipline that throws millions out of work and into cold darkness?

More likely is slow-motion decay. Mr. Sizov has slashed his work force to less than 100 from 260 and evacuated all but the lower three floors of a seven-story building, to save on heat and power. (He rents the third floor to homeless soldiers.)

Production has shriveled to a few rudimentary parts and the odd lightweight weaving machine. The plant's only new product is socks -- made on equipment it can't sell, from the wool it gets from customers without cash.

Now that the federal government wants its taxes paid in money, Mr. Sizov has turned one of his offices into a cash-only emporium of barter flotsam. The system ""is very difficult for people like me,"" says the 58-year-old engineer.

It is less so for people like Vladimir Zelentsov, a 39-year-old maestro of the barter system. Dressed in a black-denim jacket and jeans, wearing a chunky gold ring, he crisscrosses the country stitching together deals.

Recently he was in Kostroma to see an old friend, the director of a linen mill whose workers haven't been paid for two months. It has been closed for an extended summer break, though the director does have one achievement he is proud of: He recruited a 6-foot model from the local fashion school as secretary. ""She was top of her class,"" he says.

Together, the director, 38-year-old Yevgeny Shibanov, and Mr. Zelentsov play the barter game, shuffling IOUs, electricity allowances and goods from one end of the country to the other. Chemicals for the linen mill come from a factory in Chuvash region at the end of long chain, while part of its electricity comes courtesy of a nuclear power station in Kursk that owed money to KostromaEnergo -- and needed linen to complete its own elaborate barter sequence. (KostromaEnergo, meanwhile, has three tractors and tons of Siberian lumber that it got in lieu of live money.)

""Americans won't understand this,"" says Kostroma's mayor, Mr. Korobov. ""You have to have gone through the university of our market economy to understand what is going on.""

The head of the region's industry department, Mr. Filippov, thinks someone should write a book on the bizarre and perilous system. ""It will be more interesting than a horror film,"" he says."
37,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"For Vladimir Potanin, a tycoon now scrambling to keep afloat an empire that embraces banking, oil fields and a nickel smelter, the rot set into Russia's reforms a year ago with a brawl over a phone company.

Iosif Bakaleynik points instead to the years he struggled to drag a Russian tractor factory up to free-market speed. The lessons he had learned at Harvard's business school were ill-suited to Russia's treacherous terrain.

And for Yegor Gaidar, hindsight ranges over decades. The plump, squeaky-voiced economist who crafted Russia's exit from Soviet central planning in the winter of 1991-92 believes it was 70 years of communism, more than anything else, that hobbled the nation's rush to reform.

In the wake of Russia's financial debacle, the soul-searching over what went wrong runs as deep as the country's debts. What became of the promise engendered by the toppling of the Soviet Union is much more than a history or economics lesson, or an exercise in finger-pointing. The answers will guide the policies Moscow pursues in the coming critical weeks and months, how governments from Brasilia to Beijing will confront their own woes, and what, if anything, the West can do to help.

As the country gropes for direction after defaulting on its domestic debt and devaluing the ruble, basic questions arise: Was it wrong to believe that Russia could be so rapidly reconstructed? Is there something unique in Russia's history inimical to market economics? If so, do current events mark the end of another spasm of Westernization and the start of a slide back into Russia's own insular and authoritarian past?

A chronicle of the past seven years shows that the Russian reform effort, wildly ambitious in both scope and pace, suffered from a string of costly miscalculations. It was built on wobbly presumptions -- among them, that old state enterprises could become modern corporations -- and half-measures and compromises born of the country's struggle with its communist legacy. Corruption flourished, while efforts to establish fundamental laws and regulations withered. Inexperienced ministers drifted from indecision to bad decisions. Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister from 1992 until last March, provided perhaps the best summary of Russia's reform experiment, commenting on one of the country's earlier crises: ""We had wanted the best, but things turned out as always.""

The new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, a former foreign minister lacking any economic credentials, has put economic policy making in the hands of Yuri Maslyukov, onetime head of the Soviet planning agency Gosplan. The dangers are obvious: Russia has moved far enough since 1991 that the old system cannot be rebuilt; but the system remains close enough that some fragments of the past can be retrieved and pieced back together.

At the height of his authority in 1993, President Yeltsin mused on the failed reforms of czars and general secretaries. ""Peter the Great's reforms have not been achieved to this day,"" he said. Nor have ""Lenin's new economic policy, Stalin's industrialization and Khrushchev's thaw . . . changed anything fundamental in Russia.""

His own attempt, he declared, would be different.

Where it was unique was the scale. The unraveling of the Soviet Union forced Russians to redraw their borders, both mental and geographic. History, it was said, had come to an end. Russia was its terminus.

When Mr. Gaidar freed prices in January 1992, he told the Russian people to brace for severe pain but promised that their suffering would be rewarded. The past had to be dismantled swiftly, he said, to ensure it would never return. Ever since, Russia and its backers in the West have lived this idea: Fortified by democracy and billions of dollars in aid, the nation would join the advanced world.

Russia's reformers saw themselves as agents of capitalism's inevitable triumph, not politicians selling a program to the masses. Brigitte Granville, a French economist who worked with the reformers from the beginning, recalled a 1993 meeting with many of the leading liberals and officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. She worried about the impact of reform on ordinary Russians and proposed a social-safety-net loan to cushion the blow. One of the Russians immediately scolded the foreign group, saying, ""I didn't know you had a Marxist on your team.""

The government made enemies even of the country's most energetic entrepreneurs, the so-called shuttle traders who bought cheap goods in Turkey, China and Dubai for sale in Russia, by saddling them with onerous taxes and duties.

As reform began to bite, many Russians perceived democracy and the free market as their new enemies. The disenchantment was especially deep among some of the country's keen young managers and the workers they tried to convert.

Mr. Bakaleynik, the Harvard graduate, returned to Russia in 1994 after a two-year stint with the International Finance Corporation in Washington and became a pioneer of Russia's privatization program. Backed by a Moscow bank, the then-43year-old businessman gained control of a tractor factory in the town of Vladimir, 120 miles northeast of Moscow. At a meeting with his thousands of workers in a local football stadium, he echoed the words of Mr. Gaidar, warning that ""the market is cruel"" but also that it would reward those willing to work hard.

For three years, he struggled with overstaffing, outdated equipment and a government more interested in macroeconomics than in the nuts and bolts of change on the shop floor. Last year he gave up. He had slashed his work force to 5,000 from an initial 13,000, but mainly because his markets dried up. Output slumped to 1,800 tractors a year from more than 8,000.

Looking back, Mr. Bakaleynik blames the gap between theory and practice for many of his woes. ""The idea of the invisible hand doing the job in two or three years,"" he says, ""was not workable."" Instead of nurturing the revival of ailing factories, the government crippled industry through corruption, taxes, shifting policies and monetarist dogma that strengthened the ruble but strangled exports. He left the plant last year and became an oil-company executive in Moscow.

The muddle that came to characterize Russian reform began, oddly, with a decision of uncompromising clarity. By freeing prices only days after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gaidar took a wrecking ball to the central tenet of central planning. Fixed prices had smothered incentive to either produce or sell. The only other way to put goods on store shelves was to revive the political terror that had sustained the command economy. ""Either you started shooting or you liberalized prices,"" recalls Mr. Gaidar.

The economic impact was immediate. Prices rose by over 2,000% in 1992, and shop shelves filled up. The political impact was also swift. Their savings wiped out and the rubles in their pocket nearly worthless, many Russians blamed their pain on the country's young reformers, not the communist system that had created the problem.

The communists themselves began to regroup, after being routed the previous year when Mr. Yeltsin defeated a hard-line putsch. Coal miners, who only a few months earlier had been in the vanguard of support for Mr. Yeltsin, staged protests. Impoverished pensioners, many of them reduced to hawking stale Soviet-era cigarettes and old clothes on the street, joined small but angry demonstrations.

For Mr. Yeltsin, who had been basking in the approval of Western leaders and the lingering warmth of public regard that helped him unseat Mikhail Gorbachev, this was the first major challenge. Establishing a leadership style rooted in populism and frequently shifting between boldness and retreat, sickness and health, Mr. Yeltsin flinched this time. He fired Mr. Gaidar and replaced him with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former head of the gas monopoly now known as RAO Gazprom, who immediately called for an end to Russia's market ""bazaar.""

Relations between Mr. Yeltsin and the parliament festered in a series of confrontations, and the legislators' opposition soon hardened into hostility. In late 1993, Mr. Yeltsin dissolved the parliament and ringed the chamber with barbed wire. When legislators rebelled, he broke them by sending tanks to shell the parliament building.

Underlying the conflict was a fundamental clash over economics: Should the state spend its money to prop up industry, and who should own property? Moscow only fueled the debate with its other major reform step.

If price reform aimed to put bread in the stores for the short-term, privatization was the long-term plan for turning around the economy. The idea behind the program was the product of a freshly minted theory: transfer ownership from the state to workers and managers to give them a stake in success; issue shares that Russian entrepreneurs would use to take over companies and make them profitable; instead of draining money from the state through subsidies, factories would instead help finance the government with taxes.

The theory's champion was Anatoly Chubais, then head of the State Property Committee. Like Mr. Gaidar, he spoke not only the language of free markets but also English. In them, the West invested its hopes for Russia.

In late 1992, the government launched the mass privatization program by issuing 144 million vouchers that entitled nearly every Russian to secure shares in newly privatized firms. The scheme was ingenious -- democratic in its original conception and conducive to the formation of a new industrial elite. But like many other good reform ideas, it mutated.

Entrepreneur Andrei Volgin was one of the first to try putting the theory of privatization into practice. He took over five state-run enterprises, but he achieved only mixed results. For a bread factory in Vladimir, in which he secured a 46% stake, Mr. Volgin says he needed only half the 600 workers. The plant's management and local government resisted cuts. The general director gave himself a loan to buy an apartment.

What the director did in his factory, the men who should have been Russia's Rockefellers, Mellons and Carnegies were doing on a far larger scale.

Privatization raised the profile of a group of new tycoons known to the Russians as the ""oligarchs."" Back when the Soviet Union fell apart, they set up banks and used them to help the government pay its bills. The state funneled billions of rubles through their hands. As a stop-gap measure, the arrangement made sense for a government that hadn't yet set up a treasury system. But instead of lending money to entrepreneurs, banks used the government funds to make bets on the ruble and bond markets.

""The 10 biggest banks went to the casino and put Russia on the table,"" says Mr. Volgin. ""They lost.""

Alexander Smolensky, president of SBS-Agro, Russia's largest private retail bank, derides talk of an oligarchy, saying, ""The richest people here are the bureaucrats."" He blames these officials for the financial crisis, which has broken his bank. Surrounded in his headquarters by oil paintings and other trophies of earlier success, he has defied an attempt by the Central Bank to place his enterprise under state administration. A 44-year-old former printer and construction manager, Mr. Smolensky dismisses Messrs. Gaidar and Chubais as ""laboratory assistants"" in an experiment gone haywire.

Even as Russia's financial collapse has pushed some of the tycoons to the wall, they still have connections. Mr. Potanin, for instance, is struggling with foreign creditors to salvage what remains of the banking arm of his Interros financial and industrial group. But he can point to three yellow telephones on his desk that give him direct access to the government's communications network. ""This one is for the big officials, this is for the smaller ones and this is for the governors,"" he says.

Ahead of parliamentary elections in 1993, the emergent business elite helped finance the campaign of reformist candidates led by Mr. Gaidar. It was a critical time for domestic banks, coinciding with a push by foreign competitors to enter the Russian market. Even before the poll results were in, the government showed its gratitude by blocking the competition.

Despite spending far more than the communists and a party of pugnacious nationalists led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, however, Mr. Gaidar's party secured only 16% of the vote. Mr. Chernomyrdin sniffed a shift in the prevailing winds of reform, immediately declared an end to the era of ""market romanticism,"" and tried to reimpose some price controls. Although he soon abandoned that plan, he did allow another relic from the past, a group of Soviet-era factory directors, to reassert some of its influence.

Meanwhile, the bargain the state had struck with its bankers stuck, and paved the way for others. It was a cozy setup that took on many forms. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who founded Bank Menatep, one of Russia's top 10 banks, when he was in his twenties, has described Russia's prime minister as ""my boss."" Sometimes, though, it was hard to tell who was really in charge. When the ruble crashed in 1994, Mr. Khodorkovsky picked up the phone and persuaded Mr. Chernomyrdin to pressure the Central Bank to inject cash into the banking system.

The most controversial bargain came in 1995. In December of the previous year, President Yeltsin had launched a brutal war against the breakaway republic of Chechnya that killed more than 50,000 and drained as much as $5 billion from state coffers just as the country's finances were beginning to stabilize. The huge outflow of public funds tightened the embrace between the state and a few well-connected businessmen. Desperate for cash, the government mortgaged some of its most lucrative assets for a fraction of their real value in return for loans from a handful of bankers. Meeting in secret, they carved up the spoils. Government bureaucrats colluded in the so-called loans-for-shares deals, allowing ownership of the stock-in-trust to be awarded at rigged auctions.

There wasn't even a semblance of propriety. At a news conference in 1996, a Menatep executive could hardly contain his laughter when he claimed, implausibly, that he didn't know who owned the subsidiary that had just bought Yukos, Russia's second-biggest oil company. Russian journalists, served cognac by the bank's staff, guffawed in disbelief. Menatep had run the auction and the bank, it would later disclose, controlled the firm that entered the winning bid.

Beneath the jaunty confidence, though, lurked a constant fear that the state might reclaim what it had relinquished. Mr. Khodorkovsky often joked to associates, ""I don't own anything. I rent it.""

To protect the lease, the bankers banded together. In 1996, Russia's tycoons went into overdrive in support of Mr. Yeltsin's successful re-election campaign against his communist rival Gennady Zyuganov. As well as providing funds, they mobilized their media interests -- newspapers and television -- to serve Mr. Yeltsin's campaign. Boris Berezovsky, a former mathematician who had parlayed a car dealership into one of Russia's biggest personal fortunes, was frank about his motives. If Mr. Yeltsin won, he said of his tennis partner and friend, ""maybe my assets are worth billions of dollars""; if he lost, ""maybe nothing.""

All the while, the government was going broke. It couldn't collect the taxes it needed to pay its bills. So it built a rickety structure of domestic and foreign debt, creating the pyramid that collapsed in August and pushed Russia into default.

The speed with which the edifice crumbled reflected the speed with which it had been built. From the start, Russian reformers and their Western advisers wanted to move quickly, believing that financial markets, no matter how imperfect their construction or regulation, would entrench change and begin to work their magic on Russian enterprises and the economy. The West contributed billions of dollars and Russia quickly had a secondary market for stocks and bonds.

Foreign investors piled in. At one point, 80% of all trade in the stock market was from offshore investors. Bernard Sucher, one of the founders of Troika-Dialog brokerage house in Moscow, heard a knock on his door at 4 a.m. one day in 1994 from a drunken foreign hedge-fund manager desperate for a fix. ""He said it didn't matter what stock or what price. He just had to have more.""

The stampede blinded investors to the reality behind glossy brochures and lavish road shows. Russian accounting practices warped losses into profits. Regulation was virtually nonexistent. Companies diluted stockholding at will and trampled the interests of minority investors. The Russian Securities Commission had a mandate to prevent this and dollops of Western aid, but no real power.

The Central Bank fared no better in imposing order. Its chairman, Sergei Dubinin, claimed last year that $500 million in government bonds had been improperly diverted through two commercial banks. A week later, an unidentified gunman opened fire on Mr. Dubinin's home. (No one was hurt.)

According to Mr. Potanin, though, Russia's crisis sprang not from this chaos but from an attempt by the government to enforce some rules. A critical turning point, he says, was last's year's auction of the telephone company Svyazinvest. Embarrassed by the furor over loans-for-shares deals, the government organized a relatively fair and transparent sale. Forced to compete, instead of collude, Russia's barons went to war. Destroyed in the hostilities was the nonaggression pact that bound government and business together. The sale, says Mr. Potanin, was ""100% correct, but led to disaster.""

For all the shortcomings of reform, Russia still managed, on one level, to get things almost right. By last year, basic economic indicators held out the promise of recovery. Inflation had been tamed, the ruble was stable and gross domestic product grew for the first time in a decade, albeit by only 0.8%. Mr. Yeltsin defied the odds once again, surviving quintuple-bypass surgery and double pneumonia. The press and politicians pointed to the rising anger of workers over unpaid wages, which had ballooned to more than $10 billion. But predictions of widespread chaos in the streets and industrial unrest came to nothing.

Upon returning to the Kremlin in the spring of 1997, Mr. Yeltsin brought a clutch of reformers into the government. With parliamentary elections two years away, they had a rare opportunity to take tough decisions previously dodged -- such as cracking down on tax deadbeats, accelerating bankruptcies and laying off workers.

In December 1997, a special commission headed by Mr. Chubais to collect taxes decided to seize and sell the assets of two provincial oil refineries belonging to the empires of Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Potanin. The tycoons, however, marshaled their forces, and a week later, with Mr. Chernomyrdin chairing a meeting of the commission, the decision was overturned.

A cascade of accidents, bad luck and blunders followed. The price of oil and other commodities that provided more than two-thirds of Russia's hard-currency earnings began to plunge. Mr. Yeltsin shattered the political equilibrium by abruptly firing Mr. Chernomyrdin and naming a 35-year-old political neophyte, Sergei Kiriyenko, as prime minister. The financial maelstrom that had begun in Asia the previous summer looked around for its next victim and found Russia, after seven years of muddle, ripe for disaster.

The International Monetary Fund and other lenders rushed in with a promise of $22.6 billion to try to break Russia's fall, but investors' confidence continued to plummet. As Russia's markets crumpled, Mr. Gaidar, Mr. Chubais and other no-longer-so-young reformers who had laid their foundations years before came together for a last desperate attempt to preserve what they had tried to build. On the weekend of Aug. 15-16, they huddled together in the White House, the seat of the Russian government. Also there were Mr. Potanin, Mr. Berezovsky and most of Russia's other business barons. The IMF's senior Russia expert had rushed to Moscow to add his voice, but left his checkbook in Washington.

Mr. Gaidar, though long out of office, found himself confronted with ""a terrible, unpleasant choice,"" almost as fateful as the one he faced when the Soviet Union fell apart. Reformers, he says, had for years feared such an across-the-board financial collapse. Now it had come. ""It was our worst nightmare,"" says Mr. Gaidar.

On the morning of Aug. 17, Prime Minister Kiriyenko and Central Bank Chairman Dubinin announced the result of the weekend conclaves. Russia would default on government debt, devalue the ruble and impose a moratorium on the repayment of foreign private debt.

As so many times before, the government wanted to offer something for everyone, except for foreigners who had no political clout. This time, though, the attempt at compromise led to disaster. The currency sank; the banks became insolvent; and the government ruined, probably for years, its ability to borrow. A week later, Mr. Yeltsin sacked Mr. Kiriyenko, Mr. Chubais and their colleagues. Instead of saving reform, Russia's reformers ceded the initiative to the communists. The new government headed by Mr. Primakov is now groping for a third way between the familiar tensions of the state vs. the market, economic populism vs. austerity, and Russian answers vs. Western solutions.

The man who launched Russia's reforms still clings to his convictions and believes the country, after another failed search, will return to his path. Says Mr. Gaidar: ""I'm absolutely sure that I'm right."""
38,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis," On the street, Svetlana Starodubov stifles her rage. In the privacy of her own apartment, she's falling apart.

As the ruble sags, prices climb and shops empty, the stocky 43-year-old meatpie vendor paces her apartment in the middle of the night. She calls her husband a ""vampire"" and ""lazy drunk."" He says she's a nag. The two spend many nights apart; he stays in their new apartment while she camps out at the communal flat where they used to live.

When Mrs. Starodubov and her husband, Vitaly, first appeared on these pages in 1991, communism was crumbling and the couple worried they wouldn't be able to provide for themselves in the harsh new market economy. For Mrs. Starodubov, ""it was like being thrown into a boiling vat and told to find our own way out.""

For a time, they thought that they had crawled at least to the rim. They got a new apartment, a color TV and Sony VCR. They found jobs in the private sector and learned to work long hours for extra pay.

But the market economy that the Starodubovs and other working-class families had fumbled their way through has imploded, leaving them more anxious and confused than ever. In 1991, they worried about keeping up as the country rushed toward capitalism. Now they have no idea where they or the country are going.

Russia's financial crisis has knocked them back into the vat. Their incomes are sinking, and prices are rising. They don't own stocks in privatized former state companies or have permanent jobs. But at one point, they benefited from those who did. Mr. Starodubov, a 40-year-old construction worker, laid polished Italian granite tiles for Moscow's new commercial banks. Most of the banks are now bust.

On one level, the Starodubovs' spats are like those of any couple whose marriage has gone wrong. Yet they also reflect the tensions of a society once again in turmoil. Times of economic stress increase rates of depression and disease, health experts say, and Russian newspapers in recent weeks have been filled with macabre reports: A locksmith in southern Russia burned himself to death after not receiving a paycheck for two years. In Moscow, a young man committed suicide after he lost his savings and his fiancee walked away.

Like most Russians, the Starodubovs aren't about to take their anger to the streets. They don't see what would be gained by overthrowing the system. But they yearn for someone to bring stability to their lives. The ""democrats"" in power have done as little for the common man, they think, as the Communists before them. ""We're not ready for democracy,"" Mr. Starodubov says. ""We just don't understand it. Russia needs a firm hand-not a Lenin or a Stalin, but still a firm hand.""

A recent workday begins for Mrs. Starodubov at 9 a.m. Arriving at a teeming outdoor market, she dons a stained white frock. Tables are groaning with vegetables and fruits, and the air is thick with the odor of pickled garlic. In Soviet times, Mrs. Starodubov earned a paltry salary just for showing up at the state-run warehouse where she was a clerk. She had no idea how private business worked.

Today, the amount she earns depends on how much she sells. Her boss is no longer the state, but a middle-aged Tatar woman who runs a small meat-pie franchise in the Vykhino market, a gritty bazaar in a working-class neighborhood. To earn her 50 rubles a day, Mrs. Starodubov must sell 70 pies. It means hustling for eight hours on her feet with only a few short breaks. She says she sells more pies than anyone else. And when the pies sell slowly, she earns a few extra rubles packing cabbages in sacks. ""Under the old system, only people who stole got ahead,"" she says. ""Here, you can work for yourself. You smile at people and they smile back. People are learning to live life all over again.""

For a time, she dreamed of starting her own business. But that hope has perished. Once again, the issue is survival. Her boss has raised the price of the pies to five rubles from three, but takes pity on Mrs. Starodubov, who she knows is supporting her family, and lets her sell them for four.

In the Soviet era, the Starodubovs spent hours in lines to buy cooking oil or milk. Now they can buy food on any street corner. But they can't afford much. Mrs. Starodubov's salary has stayed the same since the ruble started falling in mid-August, while prices have gone up 67%. In dollar terms, she earns about $3.75 a day.

Mr. Starodubov has been staying home of late. Normally, he works on two- to three-month construction jobs on contract for private firms. But no one has cash now to build.

They waited 16 years for the flat, a boxy two-room space on the 13th floor of a concrete housing block. The small elevator doesn't always work -- sometimes it will come down only to the third floor, so they must walk up and then take it.

Until they moved here, the Starodubovs were crowded with their two children into one tiny room of the communal apartment. After waiting on a Soviet-era list and finally getting the new apartment three years ago, they rented it out for a year to nine Ukrainian workers for $250 a month.

With the cash, they bought a ""foreign"" car, Mr. Starodubov jokes: A cheap Tavria sedan, made in neighboring Ukraine. The car is used only occasionally, as when the family goes to visit Mr. Starodubov's mother, who lives about 250 miles south of Moscow. Mr. Starodubov used to have a car he called his Rolls-Royce, but it was stolen soon after the Journal article in 1991.

By the time they moved into their apartment two years ago, construction was booming in Moscow and Mr. Starodubov was bringing home regular pay. For adorning their garish new offices well and quickly, some banks would give him bonuses of $100. He bought a big Russian-built, Western-style refrigerator to replace an old model that they used to open with thick gloves so as to avoid electric shock. They also replaced the Soviet black-and-white TV with a big Grundig color model.

He pilfered some pink and black granite tiles from one bank and used them to pave the floor of the apartment's dark, fetid bathroom. Another financial institution yielded some leftover gray industrial carpet for the floor, though Mr. Starodubov has yet to lay the carpet. Mrs. Starodubov bought shelves, wallpaper and light fixtures, ""all the cheapest kinds,"" she says.

Sergei, their 19-year-old son, sleeps on a sofa in the living room, while the parents and Irina, age seven, sleep in the one bedroom. Just off the bedroom is a small balcony where the family keeps the potatoes, pickles and onions they brought back from the garden of Mr. Starodubov's mother to sustain them this winter.

In the kitchen, a makeshift shelf, held up by a chair on one end and a sink on the other, holds soap and drying dishes. The family uses bar soap to wash dishes to save on detergent.

Things were looking up until last year, when Mr. Starodubov started having trouble collecting his pay. After working at an office building owned by Tokobank, he got paid in installments of 500 to 1,000 rubles for three months. But the big Russian bank closed this summer. ""It's humiliating,"" he says. ""You give an honest effort, and they deceive you.""

Then, lured by an offer of the ruble equivalent of $1,000 a month, he left his family for three months to help refurbish some buildings at the Baikonur space center in Kazakstan, about 1,800 miles away. He had arranged for his pay to be sent to his wife, but nothing came in.

So Mrs. Starodubov starting selling meat pies. She had hoped to rely on her husband's salary after quitting a 280-rublea-month job as a cleaning woman at a factory that makes ventilators. She had gone to work there after Irina turned three and her state stipend for new mothers ran out. But she hated it because the boss was a ""self-important necktie"" who she says treated her like a vassal.

Mr. Starodubov, looking since May for his salary from Baikonur, picks up his umbrella and goes outside to a pay phone. The Starodubovs don't have a phone in their apartment because, while the service itself is cheap, installing a phone means either waiting at least five years for the state to allocate a line, or paying around $2,000 for a private service.

He reaches the phone and dials the contractor. He is still owed 6,000 rubles. Back when he did the work, it was worth $1,000. Now it's about $375.

No one answers. He resolves to try again in a few hours, and heads for the store. He has only 250 rubles left from his last disbursement. He buys a loaf of bread, whose 2.70-ruble price tag is one of the few that hasn't been raised, a three-ruble beer and a pack of Russian cigarettes for 2.50 rubles. Normally he smokes L&M, but they cost 15 rubles a pack now, up from three rubles a month ago.

Mr. Starodubov's helplessness frustrates and angers his wife, whose salary is too little for the family to live on. At home that night, weary and sore, she yells at him to get a job. ""Half of Moscow is under construction!"" she barks.

Her anger overcomes her once in a while. She chased him around the apartment one night with a plastic rod, calling him a ""vampire,"" he says, after watching a translated version of Quentin Tarantino's ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" which Sergei has brought home on video.

A few days later, she moves out to their old room in the communal apartment, which they have held on to for 50 rubles a month; the other apartment costs 144 rubles a month. They did this by deploying a bureaucratic ruse perfected by millions of couples in the Soviet era: As soon as they got the apartment three years ago, they divorced. Each is registered now at one of the state-owned properties. Because one is a communal flat slated to be broken up, they're in line for a second new flat, which might eventually be used by the children when they move out.

A few mornings after she has left, a co-worker drops by to tell Mr. Starodubov he can get his remaining salary from Baikonur that afternoon.

Mr. Starodubov picks up Irina from school. She has started first grade a year late because of developmental problems that are likely connected to trauma at birth that damaged a nerve in her neck. The car is broken, so they take a bus, the metro, a suburban train, and then another bus to get to the office where the money supposedly awaits. After a wait of an hour or so, the department director emerges, counts out 5,500 rubles, and tells Mr. Starodubov he'll have to come back another time for the other 500 rubles. ""They do that just to keep you hanging,"" Mr. Starodubov says later in disgust.

To celebrate, he drinks heavily at home that night. The next day, he takes Irina shopping to a small grocery store. Inside, some worried women are asking the manager when he's going to raise prices again. Some brands of Russian sausage are 105 rubles a kilogram, which is $16.60 at the ruble's rate before it started to fall.

Mr. Starodubov spends 19 rubles for half a kilogram of the cheapest bologna. He wants some kasha or buckwheat, but most long-life staples have been bought out. Impulsively, he buys Irina a treat: For four rubles she gets some vanilla ice cream in a chocolate-coated roll. For himself, he buys a five-ruble beer.

At a farmers' market, Mr. Starodubov picks over some dill and peppers for two rubles each. He stands in line for a slab of fresh butter for 15 rubles, up from four rubles in just a week.

As noon approaches, Irina begs her father to buy her some shashlik, or grilled kebabs. He hesitates; it's 16 rubles for five pieces of beef from a sidewalk vendor. But he gives in.

Economizing has never been easy for him. When Journal readers sent the Starodubovs $350 back in 1991, they spent it all quickly. They wasted about $30 on a pair of Chinese-made sneakers for Sergei that turned out to be mismatched and quickly fell apart.

But Mr. Starodubov will have to watch his rubles now. Until his wife comes back, he will have to stay home and take care of Irina. Sergei, who spends a lot of his evenings either at discos or watching American horror or action films on television, has just finished vocational school and is waiting to be drafted into the army for a two-year stint. Once the money runs out, Mr. Starodubov says, he can sell the garage where he stores the Tavria and live on the proceeds for a while. The family has 1,000 rubles that Mrs. Starodubov has kept in the state savings bank-worth only $62 now.

But then he'll have to find some work. ""I can't just lie on the railroad tracks,"" he says, referring to coal miners who staged protests earlier this year in Siberia.

Back at the apartment, he shows Irina how to unlock the door. She must learn, he tells her, because if he goes back to work, he may have to leave her alone. She struggles to turn the key in the lock. Finally, he turns it for her.

""You get by day to day and keep a smile on your face,"" he says. ""But inside, you feel like cats are sharpening their claws on your soul."""
39,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"Russia is looking west.

Just ask Tomas Korganov, a Moscow musician who has cast his eyes --and ears -- westward and found a cure for Russia's ills. ""They have shown us the way forward,"" he says.

During the Cold War, fed-up Russians turned for solace to the BBC, Radio Liberty and the Voice of America. Today, Mr. Korganov and others are tuning in to the voice of Alexander Lukashenko, former collective-farm manager, ice-hockey fanatic and political pinup for Russia's disaffected. Mr. Lukashenko is the president of Belarus, Russia's western neighbor and defiant outpost of opposition to Moscow's post-Soviet orthodoxy of free markets and free thinking.

""When you hear him, you know you can believe him. He does not cheat people's hopes like our politicians,"" says Mr. Korganov. ""He does what he says.""

As the roof fell in this past summer on Moscow's financial markets, Mr. Lukashenko's soothing voice entered a cacophonous debate over what to do. Courtesy of the Belarus Ministry of Communications, Russians can now hear six hours of news and views each day from the reluctantly former Soviet republic.

Beneath the shortwave static lies a message of compelling clarity for a swelling army of antimarket malcontents and pro-Soviet dreamers. Mr. Lukashenko has no time for Moscow muddle. His economic creed is simple: ""State regulation. I repeat, state regulation.""

He is firm on other issues, too. When two American balloonists drifted across his domain during an international race, his military shot them down. When foreign diplomats in Minsk, his capital, resisted an order to vacate their homes in a leafy compound, workmen welded shut the American ambassador's front gate. When a local pizza restaurant put too much ice in its margaritas, his officials shut it down.

For Yuri Bondarev, a Russian author whose books on the triumphs of the Red Army tormented Soviet schoolchildren, Mr. Lukashenko is a prophet whose time has come. ""Every one of his statements is a new step forward in understanding of the nation,"" he says.

If this is the future, it looks a lot like the past. And that is its appeal for Russians looking for solid ground. Penetrating deep into western Russia, Belarus Radio offers a daily trip down memory lane into a cozy world free of chaotic debate, ear-shattering pop music and grim bulletins on the collapse of the ruble. The Belarus currency, nicknamed the ""bunny rabbit,"" is even more sickly, but listeners are spared the bad news.

Instead, they get wholesome, uplifting fare -- how Belarus keeps streets clean and prices low, how it pays salaries on time and makes the enemies of the people do time, and how it dreams of one day putting the fragments of the Soviet Union back together again. It is not a formula with mass appeal, especially since announcers frequently lapse into Belarussian, a Slavic language close to Russian but not close enough. (For those eager to catch every word, Mr Lukashenko, who goes by the name of Batka or Daddy, has published a collection of speeches and aphorisms.)

Russians who prefer to look farther west than Minsk for guidance could once dismiss Mr. Lukashenko and his Russian fans as marginal and mostly geriatric oddballs. Mr. Korganov, for example, is 73. The fringe, though, is now filtering into the mainstream. Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, 68, began his career under Nikita Krushchev. His economic policy maker, Yuri Maslyukov, ran the Soviet planning agency, Gosplan.

But the old creed isn't confined to old-timers. Among new converts is Alexei Ulyanov, a 21-year-old economics major at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. President Clinton visited a month ago and lectured students on the ""failed policies of the past."" Mr. Ulyanov wasn't impressed. Though too young to feel nostalgia for the Soviet Union, he is old enough to have decided he doesn't like what replaced it.

While a member of the generally middle-of-the-road Yabloko party, he says Russia needs a strong state and strong leader to run it. Mr. Lukashenko, he believes, could be the man. He also admires former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. ""At certain stages of development, democracy is not the answer,"" he says.

A procession of Russian politicians and regional governors has trekked to Minsk to watch, and often applaud, the clock being turned back. Mr. Primakov visited yesterday. Russian television crews have poured in to record what Mr. Lukashenko proclaims an ""economic miracle.""

The traffic out of Belarus has been equally heavy: The International Monetary Fund pulled out; most U.S. and European diplomats left this past summer after Mr. Lukashenko ordered them to vacate homes located near his own and find other accommodations.

For many Russians, Mr. Lukashenko is a Slavic Robin Hood. He regularly rounds up businessmen who try to obey the market instead of his orders. A recent opinion poll ranked him Russia's third-most-popular politician. With ambitions far bigger than his own 10 million people, he says he might run for the Russian presidency. He is unlikely ever to win, but he will help shape the campaign. His would-be voters don't mind that he has a foreign passport. ""We all belong to the same big Soviet family,"" says Vyacheslav Shtruzhkov, a Moscow engineer who makes frequent visits to Belarus. He likes what he sees: factories fueled by cheap state credits and regular police roundups of troublemakers.

Belarus says its gross national product increased 10% last year, compared with an increase of less than 1% in Russia. Mr. Ulyanov, the economics student, points to empirical evidence, too: On a recent trip to his hometown on the edge of Siberia, he found that the only shoes he could buy came from Belarus. Western economists scoff at Belarus statistics and say the country is actually a model of what not to do. Mr. Lukashenko pioneered many of the things now feared in Russia: empty shelves, a burgeoning black market and long lines.

The more foreigners carp, though, the greater Mr. Lukashenko's appeal. He champions a robust pan-Slavic solidarity that brooks no nonsense from outsiders. Valery Ganichev, chairman of the Union of Writers of Russia, sees Belarus as an ideological guerrilla base for the reconquest of Russia. ""During the war, Belarus partisans looked to Moscow for help."" Now, he says, it is the other way around.

The Kremlin, anxious about Mr. Lukashenko's almost hypnotic appeal, tried, briefly, to keep him out of Russia. Last October, it withdrew landing permission for his plane to prevent a trip to the towns of Lipetsk and Yaroslav.

Nonetheless, the roadshow has rolled on. On a tour of Russia's far east, Mr. Lukashenko spoke at the Vladivostok Marine Academy and delighted his audience with a vow to protect the ""glory of the Soviet army"" and jokes about crushing protest rallies.

Russia's economic debacle has put him in a bind. It has helped spread the antimarket discontent on which he thrives. But it has also exposed the flaws of his ""market socialism."" Dependent on Russia for oil, gas and markets, Belarus is reeling.

Mr. Korganov, the Moscow musician, says he would still vote for Mr. Lukashenko, as a slap in the face to Moscow's post-Soviet order. He says he has never trusted fashion. In the Soviet era, he used to listen every day to radio broadcasts from the West. ""They told us things we didn't know ... Now they just say the same thing as our government. It used to be a lot more interesting."""
40,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"As winter looms and food runs low, Russia's regions are growing hungry -- for power. Behind worries that Russia might not have enough to eat lies a more menacing shortage. The central government doesn't have enough authority to stop tree lines and hedgerows from turning into borders between rival fiefs and would-be statelets.

One of these ad hoc boundaries is a row of silver birch that marks the edge of Irina Radinskaya's farm, a former collective estate 375 miles south of Moscow. The molasses-black soil here is so potentially rich that when Hitler invaded, he wanted it dug up and sent back to Germany.

The harvest this year has been poor, but still good enough for traders across Russia to bombard Mrs. Radinskaya with telephone calls asking about her crop.

She has told them about the 250 tons of rye piled for over two months in a warehouse as long as a football field, the barley lying in a concrete shed, and the sunflower crop now being harvested. But she has also told them of the birches, the police post on a nearby highway and Ivan Shabanov, the former Communist Party boss who is now regional governor.

No matter how hungry Moscow, Murmansk or other cities get, Ms. Radinskya can't help them. Nor can she help herself.

Add another problem to Russia's long list. In an economically crippled country, Russians now find political weevils infesting the food chain and nettling Moscow. What haunts Russia today isn't the passionate separatism that galvanized the Baltic republics into revolt in the last years of the Soviet Union and fired Chechen fighters in their 1994-96 war with Moscow. It is instead the banal and often bungling defiance of Soviet-bred barons eager to keep bread cheap, sausages plentiful and their own interests secure.

They may be small potatoes so far, but not harmless. The danger, says Alexander Frolov, a Moscow-appointed public prosecutor in Voronezh, is that Russia, like the Soviet Union before, will unravel if local bosses are left to set their own economic policies.

The trees on the edge of Mrs. Radinskaya's farm trace not only the limit of her property, but also the boundary with the neighboring region of Lipetsk. Until last month, neither she nor anyone else paid any attention. Voronezh and Lipetsk were merely administrative units of a single nation governed from Moscow. Now she isn't sure who governs what. The last threads of certainty have snapped, says Mrs. Radinskaya, whose 123 workers labor to support nearly 450 pensioners and children. ""They have already taken our trousers, now they want to leave us without our underwear, too.""

The underlying problem is that Moscow leaders are offering no solutions, so regional officials feel they have to act themselves. Mr. Shabanov and at least four other governors have tried to ban the movement of food out of their domains; another governor has said he might introduce a regional currency to make up for a shortage of rubles; another has stopped paying taxes to the federal government, and many more threaten to do the same. ""This kind of `fief' mentality must definitely be stopped,"" Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told a recent gathering of regional bosses, ""Otherwise we lose Russia as a unified state and our descendants will never forgive us.""

Mr. Frolov tries to preserve the country's fragile unity in Voronezh, working from a courthouse office that he refers to as ""an island of Russian authority."" He spends his days battling a flood of local directives and orders that ""have neither law nor common sense."" On his desk he keeps a small model guillotine, but after weeks of combat with regional officials, he says he is ""thinking of also getting an electric chair.""

His biggest headache has been Decree No. 890, the foundation stone of what critics mock as the ""Voronezh Wall."" The document, signed by Mr. Shabanov last month and titled ""On Measures to Ensure Food Security for the Region,"" turned the trees that run along the edge of Mrs. Radinskaya's farm into an ersatz national border. The order made a smuggler of anyone moving regional food across the line and ordered security forces to halt trucks and railway wagons carrying grain and other essential goods out of Voronezh without a license.

Like most Russian decrees, whether issued by President Boris Yeltsin or regional barons, Mr. Shabanov's order was only patchily enforced. Local businessmen dubbed it the ""150-ruble decree"" after the bribes of about $11.50 they say they have to pay to get through police checkpoints. Even authorities concede that they can't stop illicit traffic. ""There are too many connecting roads,""says Vladimir Pupynin, head of the Voronezh economic department.

But the decree still caused enough confusion and concern to deter Mrs. Radinskaya and many others from seeking markets for their goods outside the region, where food is scarcer and prices higher. ""Everything might go smoothly, but it is too dangerous,"" she says, ""I'm the one who gets punished if we get caught.""

The food-related decrees stem from real concerns, as well as self-interest. Along with other parts of what should be Russia's breadbasket, Voronezh has suffered a serious drought. Nationwide, the grain harvest so far this year is only half what it was in the same period in 1997, prompting appeals for international food aid and the establishment of an emergency food reserve by the government. In Voronezh, the harvest is down at least 30%. The collapse of the ruble has added further woe, strangling a trade in American chickens, Ecuadorian bananas and other imports needed to keep shops stocked.

But more capricious and potentially far more dangerous than either the weather or the weak currency has been the response of Mr. Shabanov and other regional governors to the crisis. Meddling by local officials has both short-circuited market forces -- effectively reinstating price controls -- and corroded the economic ties that bind Russia together into a single nation.

""Separatism has many faces,"" says Boris Kuznetsov, President Yeltsin's representative in Voronezh. ""What has happened here is very serious."" But as an appointed official, he has no real power other than persuasion. He depends on Mr. Shabanov for office space in the headquarters of the regional administration.

Voronezh bureaucrats deny any desire to break away from Russia. ""We are not trying to set up our own country,"" says Mr. Pupynin. ""We are just taking special measures to protect our own interests."" These interests, though, and those of many other regions, are increasingly at odds with those of Moscow, which Mr. Pupynin describes as a ""powerful vacuum cleaner"" that, if left unchecked, will suck Voronezh dry of the food and other goods it needs to feed the region's 2.5 million people.

The incentive to sell elsewhere is indeed great. At a recent meeting with other farm managers, Mrs. Radinskaya swapped intelligence on the prices offered for their crops in other regions. The head of a neighboring farm reported that sunflower-seed oil was selling outside for 5,000 rubles a ton, compared with less than 2,000 rubles in Voronezh. Eggs, sausage and bread all fetch less than in Moscow.

But critics say that the local government has only itself to blame. Alarmed by an outbreak of panic buying after the ruble's devaluation in August, Mr. Shabanov, the governor, issued a decree to try to calm a stampede that left shops without eggs and, in just two days, reduced stores of 600 tons of butter to just 48 tons.

The order effectively outlawed inflation, imposing price controls for bread, flour, milk, eggs and other staples. The response of the market was immediate. Some traders closed shop, while others began scouting for buyers outside the province. The black market flourished. The government responded by issuing Decree No. 890, which restricted the movement of ""farm products, raw materials and foodstuffs.""

Mr. Pupynin, the Voronezh economic-department chief, says the government faced a terrible dilemma: raise prices to Moscow levels or clamp controls on food leaving the region. ""We don't want to close the market, but just want to make sure the people of Voronezh don't starve,"" Mr. Shabanov declined requests for an interview.

The measures, though, reflect the mind-set of many regional leaders, most of whom first came to power in the Soviet system. Some, like Mr. Shabanov, lost their footing after the failed hard-line putsch in Moscow in 1991 but are now back in their old offices.

""They are the old breed of apparatchiks. They work like they did before and think like they did before,"" says Nikolai Sukhanov, a former university lecturer who owns a private cheese-making factory near Mrs. Radinskaya's farm. He also was shocked by the intensity of panic buying, but more disturbing was the reaction of the local administration. ""They are living in Wonderland,"" he says.

The mists of the past are particularly thick in the office of Vladimir Trunov, a ruddy-faced bureaucrat who heads a committee set up to control the movement of foodstuffs. Anyone wanting to move staples out of the region needs his approval, a laborious process watched over by Lenin, whose portrait decorates the wall. ""I still believe in him,"" says Mr. Trunov, snarling at the notion that free-market trade can bring anything but ruin. ""Buying for kopecks and selling for rubles is theft.""

He insists, however, that the only formal restriction on trade is a demand that all farmers first clear their debts with the regional government and a quasistate combine that provides fuel and credits in return for crops. But since probably every farm is deep in debt, the criterion amounts to a blanket ban.

Mrs. Radinskaya is among those buried by debt. She took fuel and fertilizer on credit and promised to sell her crops to Agroresursi, the region's principal buyer of grain. After a bumper harvest last year, she got 715 rubles for each ton of rye. This year, despite widespread shortages, she is being offered only 280 rubles. She also got a threatening letter from the local government ordering her to pay off her debts or risk confiscation. ""If I sell to them, I lose,"" she says. ""If I sell to anyone else, I get punished."" She decided to do neither and stored the harvested rye in her warehouse.

Some regions have camouflaged their defiance of Moscow. In Saratov, due east of Voronezh, one of the few places with a relatively good harvest, officials announced a convoluted scheme under which farmers are ""invited"" to keep their goods inside the province's boundaries. Other approaches are more blunt. Gov. Nikolai Kondratenko of Krasnodar, on the Black Sea, signed a decree simply prohibiting the shipment of all goods of ""social significance,"" a highly flexible basket of goods.

Such barriers, though frequently breached, have provoked outcries from impoverished parts of Russia vulnerable to food shortages even in a good year. ""If these restrictions take hold it will be the end for us in the north,"" says Boris Misnik, chairman of a parliamentary commission that looks after the interests of 12 million Russians living in remote northern settlements. The mayor of the arctic town of Murmansk recently phoned officials in Voronezh to plead for food supplies.

Moscow has also cried foul, ordering public prosecutors across the country to examine local decrees and take legal action against measures that risk carving the country into a jumble of regional autarkies. The counterattack has had some success, at least on paper. Many areas have lifted formal restrictions but can still deploy a vast army of tax collectors, transport police, health inspectors and other officials to ensure that local interests prevail over those of either the market or Moscow.

Aside from a few regions with large ethnic minorities, such as Dagestan and Kalmykia, Russia has been spared the nationalist fervor that destroyed the Soviet Union. And even a severe breakdown in food supplies would probably leave the formal structure of the state intact. But it would be a hollow state of regional baronies.

In the end, this is not a dispute about flags or emblems but something far more basic-bread. What happens to Mrs. Radinskaya's rye and other similar hoards across Russia's agricultural heartland will help decide who eats, how much and where. For Mr. Shabanov, what matters is keeping Voronezh fed cheaply. For Mr. Misnik, though, keeping Voronezh and other grain-rich regions content could mean starvation in Russia's arctic north.

""Unfortunately, baking bread is not a business. It is a form of social welfare,"" says Viktor Degtyarev, marketing director of Voronezh's Torbus Bread Factory. ""If there is no cheap bread, there is no government."""
41,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis,"There was nothing secret about Yevgeny Adamov's visit last month to Iran: The Russian nuclear chief took a 20-member delegation of scientists and politicians for a triumphant inspection of Bushehr, the $800 million nuclear-power plant Russia is building on the Persian Gulf coast.

Back in Moscow, Mr. Adamov announced the work is going so well that Tehran may soon order another three civilian power reactors. ""This is a good prospect, and there was every sense in going to Iran,"" he said

But it is what's going on in the shadows of Bushehr that has American proliferation experts truly worried.

According to U.S. intelligence reports, officials from at least two key Russian nuclear-research institutes are quietly negotiating to sell Iran a 40-megawatt heavy-water research reactor and a uranium-conversion facility. While the talks are in an early stage, the reports suggest Russian nuclear scientists are already secretly advising Iran on how to produce heavy water and nuclear-grade graphite. American officials believe the technology and information are building blocks for a long-range Iranian effort to manufacture plutonium or highly-enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb.

Perhaps even more extraordinary, the Russian researchers are selling their knowledge for incredibly little: a few hundred thousand dollars so far, according to U.S. officials. That the Russians would take such chances, and especially for such small amounts of cash, is a measure of both the desperation and the arrogance of Russia's once all-powerful Ministry of Atomic Energy, better known as Minatom.

Since the breakup of the Soviet Union the world has held its breath, waiting for Russia's nuclear arsenal to leak. So far there have been remarkably few confirmed incidents of fissionable material smuggled out of Russia or top scientists wooed away by rogue states. But the dangers of proliferation are growing as Russia's economic crisis shows no sign of abating. Moscow is months behind in salary payments to weapons designers and even the guards patrolling nuclear-weapons sites.

At least as worrisome these days is what appears to be Russia's deliberate proliferation. Minatom's Mr. Adamov believes that nuclear-reactor sales may be his cash-starved ministry's only hope for survival. A four-reactor deal with Iran could bring as much as $4 billion -- assuming Tehran pays its bills. The covert assistance may be an additional service intended to keep Iranian customers happy and in a buying mood. In marketing, the technique is known as a loss leader.

Viktor Mikhailov, Mr. Adamov's predecessor and now his first deputy, offered a similar sweetener during the 1995 Bushehr negotiations: a gas centrifuge that could manufacture nuclear fuel -- or enrich natural uranium to weapons-grade. ""I needed to promise them a carrot and that's what I did,"" he explains. Moscow dropped the deal after the paperwork leaked and the White House protested.

""Minatom is like an empire. It needs money to survive,"" says Alexei Yablokov, a former top science adviser to President Boris Yeltsin and a longtime foe of the nuclear establishment. ""It does not want proliferation. It just doesn't think about it. It cares only about its own survival.""

Mr. Adamov flatly denies that his country is helping to create a nuclear-armed Iran and says the White House has been misled by its intelligence agencies. The Russians also are interested in cultivating closer ties with Tehran and appear skeptical that Iranian scientists can mount a successful nuclear-weapons program, even with Russian advice.

The situation presents the U.S. with some tough policy decisions. So far, the Clinton administration has been hesitant to press the Russians too publicly or too hard, fearing a backlash in Moscow and on Capitol Hill. To secure Russia's unraveling nuclear arsenal, officials argue, they need both Moscow's cooperation and millions in U.S. aid. This year alone, the U.S. has supplied more than $400 million in cash and services for nuclear security programs in Russia.

Choking off U.S. aid or interfering with Minatom's export trade could feed the ministry's economic decay, creating even greater proliferation problems. In recent months, the Clinton administration has quietly cut aid to one of the research institutes believed to be involved in supplying covert aid to Iran.

Yet so far, Washington's private protests and pleas have had little impact. After a U.S. special envoy recently presented him with what one official calls hard evidence of ""people and blueprints being exchanged,"" Mr. Adamov wrote to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to protest ""the unproven and less-than-attractive discussions of the violations supposedly taking place."" U.S. officials say the discussions have been especially rancorous because the institute believed to be taking the lead in the deal is Nikiet, the reactor-design institute headed up by Mr. Adamov until this spring.

The U.S. is also keeping a wary eye on recent Minatom negotiations with Syria to build a small light-water research reactor, and similar talks with Libya. This spring, Russia defied world opinion-and its own nonproliferation pledges -- when it decided to go ahead with a $2.6 billion nuclear-power plant sale to India. The announcement came just weeks after New Delhi set off nuclear tests. Mr. Adamov said he really had no choice: ""The main thing is that there should be work and jobs.""

Throughout the Cold War, Minatom's power and privilege was unrivaled. Its domain includes 10 secret cities where Russia's nuclear weapons were designed and built; scores of research facilities and institutes; 29 nuclear-power reactors; uranium, diamond and gold mines, and even farms to feed its estimated one million employees and family members. When Russian newspapers last year reported that the Soviet Politburo had once ordered Minatom to produce suitcase-size atomic bombs, ministry officials dismissed the notion as preposterous, not because such bombs don't exist, but because the Politburo would never have dared to order around Russia's nuclear barons.

Ivan Gradobitov, a technician who spent 30 years working at Arzamas-16, Russia's main secret warhead facility, has more personal memories of that golden age: a pride in defending the motherland, as well as special shops for Minatom workers filled with ""red caviar, black caviar, everything . . . I used to say: `If only everyone in Russia could live like we did in Arzamas-16.""' Mr. Gradobitov now works for a nuclear workers' trade union organizing strikes and protests.

On a recent evening, hundreds of Minatom stalwarts gathered to celebrate that past in Moscow's Hall of Columns, a majestic 18th century ballroom under whose chandeliers Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev lay in state. They were there to honor Efim Slavsky, the late head of the Ministry of Medium Machine Building -- the nuclear ministry's Cold War cover name intended to deceive outsiders about its real purposes.

Cries of ""comrade"" boomed from the podium. A goose-stepping honor guard paraded a red velvet flag bearing Lenin's image. Bald pates and bemedalled breasts gleamed. Eyes moistened as two presidential hopefuls, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and General Alexander Lebed, pledged that Minatom's star would rise again. At the end, the audience rose as a military band played the national anthem-not Russia's but that of the Soviet Union. The evening's master of ceremonies was Mr. Adamov.

Daily reality for Mr. Adamov is much harsher. Two days before he set off for Tehran, workers at Chelyabinsk-70, Russia's other premier bomb-making facility, went on strike to demand five months in back wages. (Two years ago, Chelyabinsk's despairing director shot himself in the head.) On the eve of his departure, Mr. Adamov appeared before Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, to detail his list of woes. The state electricity company pays only 1% of its bills in cash to Minatom power stations. The government coughs up only one-twentieth of the research funding it gave five years ago. Powerful financial interests are fighting for control of Minatom's dwindling cash. ""A war is going on,"" he warned.

American officials briefly cheered when Mr. Adamov, 58 years old, took over the ministry in March. His hard-drinking, chain-smoking predecessor, Mr. Mikhailov, who made his career designing and testing nuclear warheads, was seen as a dangerous and uncontrollable cold warrior, a true baron of the old nuclear elite. Almost by definition, Mr. Adamov, who rose through the ranks designing civilian nuclear reactors -- including the kind found at the doomed Chernobyl plant -- had to be less powerful and more easily swayed.

Mr. Adamov's personal style is certainly very different. He is a taut, almost ascetic man who speaks good English, has published more than 150 scientific papers, and can talk knowledgeably about the arts. His wife is a former ballerina. A recent dining companion says he prefers gin and tonic, in moderation, to vodka.

But there is a brittle pride beneath the refined, cosmopolitan surface. After his first meeting with DOE's Mr. Richardson, Mr. Adamov complained that the American hadn't paid sufficient attention. ""He yawned in such a way that I could study all the teeth in his mouth, and he had difficulty opening his eyes,"" he said.

Mr. Adamov's flare for commerce has also drawn harsh criticism at home, and sparked unproven rumors of corruption, especially from the Minatom old guard. ""Atomic power and even atomic weapons are falling into the hands of people who see nothing but money,"" sniffs Georgi Kaurov, a former Mikhailov lieutenant.

For all of Mr. Adamov's enthusiasm, Russia was Iran's last choice for the Bushehr project. West Germany's Siemens first began building two light-water nuclear reactors for the Shah's government in 1974, only to have the project suspended in 1979 by Iran's new fundamentalist rulers. The site was badly damaged in a half-dozen bombing raids during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war.

Even before the bombing stopped, Tehran began shopping for a new contractor to build Bushehr. The U.S. managed to block a bid by a European consortium and then pressured the Spanish government's nuclear enterprises into canceling signed protocols. Washington also headed off smaller component sales by companies in Italy, the Czech Republic and Poland. Only then did Iran turn to Minatom. A January 1996 agreement called for the reactor to be finished by 2000 -- a deadline unlikely to be met.

Despite their public protests, American officials privately say they have few problems with Bushehr itself. For one, they aren't sure that the project, which has been plagued by financial and technical problems, will ever be finished. Minatom officials admit that so far they have been paid only $50 million for their work. The Iranians, who have already invested billions in Bushehr, have refused to allow the Russians to raze the existing structures, demanding instead that they fit their very different technology inside the German-built shell.

If Bushehr is completed, the light-water reactor -- much like an American -- sponsored plant for North Korea -- will be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its spent fuel, even if diverted, would be difficult to reprocess for nuclear weapons.

What worries U.S. officials instead is the cover Bushehr may provide for more dangerous trade. Iran insists it has no interest in developing nuclear weapons. U.S. officials quietly acknowledge that any clandestine program is still in its infancy, in good part because of American efforts to frustrate their plans. But U.S. officials also cite a long history of Iranian efforts to procure weapons-related technology.

Iran has two possible routes if it wants to manufacture its own fissionable material: an enrichment plant, likely a gas centrifuge, for enhancing uranium to weapons grade, or a heavy-water or graphite-moderated nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant for producing plutonium. Iran has tried for both. In recent years it has attempted to buy a gas centrifuge from Russia and a conversion plant from China that could produce the uranium gas to feed a centrifuge or fuel for a heavy-water or graphite reactor. Both deals were blocked by the Americans.

Mr. Adamov makes no secret that he would like to sell Iran more than just power reactors. He has announced that he is personally lobbying the Kremlin to allow the export of a light-water research reactor, part of the original Bushehr deal that was canceled after U.S. protests. That is in addition to the potentially more dangerous uranium-conversion plant and 40-megawatt heavy-water research reactor that U.S. officials say Russian nuclear institutes have been secretly negotiating to provide Iran.

""One would expect a well-thought-out civilian cover story, and there could be a civilian use for these facilities,"" including nuclear research and medical-isotope production, says David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. ""But it could also give Iran the ability to make plutonium for nuclear weapons. Without Russian assistance they're at least 10 years away from building this technology on their own.""

U.S. officials say the negotiations and giving of technical advice have been going on for at least six months but still seem to be in preliminary stages. As far as the U.S. can tell, no equipment has been shipped. Officials also say that they are baffled about how the sales could play out. It would be difficult, they admit, for Tehran to hide either a heavy-water reactor or a conversion plant. As a member of the IAEA, Iran would have to place any overt reactor plant under international monitoring, or break out of the inspection regime.

Inside the Clinton administration, a debate has raged for several months on how hard to press the Russians on the Iranian deals. U.S. officials admit that they aren't sure what, if any, leverage will work.

If money is indeed the issue, the administration should have considerable influence. This year, the U.S. spent $230 million on blended-down, highly enriched uranium removed from dismantled Russian nuclear warheads. The U.S. is also spending $430 million on dismantling warheads, improving the accounting and security of Russia's vast uranium and plutonium stockpile, and trying to find alternative work for Russian nuclear scientists.

The problem is that cutting back on that aid might only increase the dangers. ""It's specifically not in America's interest if a Russian nuclear weapon is stolen or a Russian scientist is suborned,"" warns DOE's Mr. Richardson.

While some U.S. officials argue that more aid may be the only way to head off even greater proliferation dangers, it is far from clear that aid will head off Minatom's export decisions.

At a press conference after his return from Iran last month, Mr. Adamov angrily rejected a Russian journalist's suggestion that Minatom is jeopardizing American assistance by its continued dealings with Tehran. The U.S., he said, provided only ""sops and handouts"" to Russia. ""The honorable way is to earn money. Begging and borrowing are dishonorable."""
42,WSJ,Staff,1999,Russia Financial Crisis," Ivan Orlov was a Russian Everyman. He grew up on a collective farm, served in the Soviet army, trained as a mechanic, married, had two children and bought a boxy Moskvich car. And, like many others, he endured a torrent of tribulation. He lost his job; his marriage soured; his pension stopped coming.

Neighbors in this decaying industrial town describe the 65-year-old as unusual only in the tireless attention he lavished on his ancient, canary-yellow car. ""He kept it alive long after it should have died,"" says Vasily Lokolov, his next-door neighbor on Station Street.

Today, the car is a charred carcass.

On a bitterly cold night last month, Mr. Orlov prepared his cherished Moskvich for a final journey. According to police, he loaded in a homemade bomb and attached a crude detonator to a canister of gasoline; he then drove to Red Square and left the car. It exploded near Spassky Gate, the main entrance to the Kremlin, injuring three Kremlin guards.

Was this an isolated act of mad despair or a harbinger of a collective breakdown, the prospect of which has so long spooked the West? Despite an economic crisis that has left nearly a third of the population below the poverty line -- around $30 a month -- Russia shows scant signs of mass unrest. Nonetheless, the fringes are fraying.

""I am a kamikaze for the people,"" Mr. Orlov wrote in a rage-filled screed mailed to The Wall Street Journal shortly before the bombing. ""I am acting as a patriot."" In his smoldering Moskvich, police found copies of a virulently anti-Semitic newspaper and a placard protesting against unpaid pensions. Mr. Orlov was arrested on the spot and charged with terrorism. Two days before Christmas, he was found dead in his cell at Moscow's Butyrskaya prison. Authorities said the cause was heart failure.

Russia's extremist fringe has proclaimed Mr. Orlov a hero and plans to put up a plaque in his honor in Moscow. Authorities, meanwhile, portray him as an unhinged misfit. In his hometown of Podolsk, a city of 220,000 south of Moscow, the verdict is more muddled. Few cheer his methods, but many say they share his anger.

The Red Square bombing is just one of several traumas that have ruffled Russia's otherwise calm surface over the past two months. In St. Petersburg, a prominent liberal politician, Galina Staravoitova, was murdered in the stairwell of his apartment. The killers shouted ""crush the filth"" as they opened fire. In Yaroslav, an arsonist burned down 25 country houses belonging to Russia's nouveaux riches; local residents call him their Robin Hood. In Saratov, police arrested a jobless man for planning a bomb attack on an apartment block that housed officials, In Ulyanov, a teacher died after a hunger strike to protest against unpaid wages. In Moscow, a man who lost his savings in Russia's financial crash took employees of his downtown bank hostage at gunpoint. (He released them unharmed.)

Mr. Orlov's trajectory from banality to bomb maker illuminates the national discontent bubbling below the surface. On the wall of his threadbare apartment hangs a picture of Stalin and a wooden carving with the saying, ""Easy to be God, easy to be the Devil."" A family photo album recalls happier times: A snapshot shows Mr. Orlov next to his Moskvich, a bouquet of yellow flowers in his hand. Under his desk, he left a briefcase stuffed with wild polemics and a neatly typed manuscript that heaps invective on President Boris Yeltsin.

Mr. Orlov's scribblings reveal a disturbed, feverish mind. Before heading for Red Square, he worte a bitter lament expressing his frustration at not being able ""to find, to buy or to invent a bigger bomb"" to blow himself and President Yeltsin to a maximum of pieces."" If killing Mr. Yeltsin was indeed his goal, however, more explosives wouldn't have helped: The day of the bombing, Nov. 4, the president was on holiday at the Black Sea.

It takes less than two hours to drive to Red Square from Podolsk. But Mr. Orlov's journey there stretched over years. It began more than a decade ago with the hopes unleashed by Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika. A Communist Party member, Mr. Orlov cheered the promise of change. In 1991, he transferred his faith to Boris Yeltsin. Then, propelled by a volatile mix of personal and political frustration, he drifted into a squalid underworld of radical revolt.

When perestroika began, Mr. Orlov worked at the Podolsk auto school, teaching mechanics. Former colleagues remember him as conscientious and capable, but they say he annoyed his bosses by constantly complaining about their lack of zeal for reform. ""He began fighting with everyone,"" says Julia Harylneva, the school's veteran bookkeeper. In the late 1980s, after years of squabbling, Mr. Orlov was fired. About the same time, his first marriage fell apart.

""I fell victim to Gorby's appeal. I was mesmerized by him and went astray,"" Mr. Orlov wrote in the document sent to this newspaper. ""Carried away by his slogans, his perestroika, I started to fight actively against all that was defective in our life. I made Gorby portraits, gave them as presents to my friends and acquaintances. I urged people to follow Gorby, to listen to him.""

After being fired, Mr. Orlov meandered between odd jobs and ever odder causes. His main source of income became selling newspapers, mostly radical ones, first in the lobby of parliament for Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party and then on the steps of the former Lenin Museum, a favorite meeting point for disgruntled war veterans, neo-Stalinist punks and other disaffected casualties of Russia's stumbling shift from Marxism to the market. To supplement his earnings -- and publicize his fury -- he wrote two rambling tracts for Palaya, a small Moscow publishing house that specializes in incendiary, argumentative pieces. (Its other ventures include leather-bound Russian translations of works by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and the late North Korean dictator Kim Il-Sung.)

Mr. Orlov's editor was Nikolai Mishin, who runs a clearinghouse for extremist literature in the Union of Writers of Russia. Ragged pensioners and unemployed youths parade through his office scouting for books and pamphlets they can sell on the street. The current bestsellers, Mr. Mishin says, are a Stalinist tome and a collection of ribald jokes about President Yeltsin. Among other things, the president's initials sound in Russian very similar to a vulgar Russian word for sex.

Mr. Orlov's own published output -- a slim volume titled ""Yeltsin Country"" and a longer work called ""Russia's Groan"" -- are out of stock. Investigators from the Federal Security Service, successor agency to the KGB, and journalists took the last copies, Mr. Mishin says.

The immediate trigger of Mr. Orlov's trip to Red Square is hard to place. Some friends blame a bitter quarrel with his second wife, Nana, a refugee from the war-ravaged Black Sea region of Abkhazia, over the ownership of the flat on Station Street. Others say the last straw was his unpaid pension. Nana says he began to crack four months ago, just as Moscow's markets buckled, but she blames the overheated political polemics that followed the crash rather than any direct economic impact on him personally.

In recent months, she says, he became a devout reader of, and sometime contributor to, Russkaya Pravda, a rabidly anti-Semitic, anti-Christian and anti-American tabloid. ""He didn't drink, he didn't smoke, but he became addicted to anger,"" she says.

Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko says Mr. Orlov was almost certainly mentally ill, but he worries that ""frustration and the feeling of defeat"" afflict much of the country. Mr. Kiriyenko, who was fired in August only five months after taking office with a mandate to inject energy into Russia's faltering reforms, says people's ""ideals have been taken away."" A big mistake of post-Soviet reform, he adds, was to ""create too great expectations.""

In Podolsk, these expectations crumbled with the town's largest employer, a sewing-machine plant once staffed by more than 18,000 workers. Taken over by Semi-Tech Corp. of Canada, the parent company of Singer sewing machines, the factory now employs only 2,000.

Among those fired was Tatyana Alpatikina. After 30 years making sewing machines, she now peddles Vietnamese-made garments from a snow-sprinkled stall. Until this fall, she could support herself and her jobless husband. Now she is desperate: Sales have shriveled while prices for the drugs she needs for a thyroid problem have skyrocketed. She says she understands the anger that drove Mr. Orlov to Red Square. ""This was a cry from his soul,"" she says.

Mr. Orlov's next-door neighbor, Mr. Lokolov, says they never discussed politics, only their bad plumbing and plans by a local businessman to open a beer hall across the road. What shocks neighbors is not Mr. Orlov's violence but his belief that politics can change anything. For them, neither bombs nor ballot boxes offer any solution.

""Protest? Against whom? For what?"" asks Mr. Lokolov, 41, a metalworker who hasn't been paid since September, hasn't voted since 1991 and hasn't a smidgen of trust in anyone outside his own family. ""It's every man for himself. This is the law of the jungle."" Upstairs, unemployed music teacher Galina Myachina frets about finding a job and about rumors that the heating might go off. But she, too, dismisses protest as pointless.

Such attitudes help explain why, rather than increasing, organized protest seems to be declining: A nationwide day of strikes and rallies led by the Communist Party and trade unions in October attracted fewer than a million people, compared with 1.8 million a year before. In Podolsk, only a hundred or so gathered to wave red flags next to a statue of Lenin. Communism's foes have fared no better. The Podolsk branch of Yabloko, a centrist liberal party, has withered to a handful of activists. ""People don't believe in anything or anyone,"" sighs Ludmilla Krasnenkova, Yabloko's local chairman.

But there is a flip side to such indifference. It has created a vacuum in which the boundary between the mainstream and the marginal blurs. Few Russians embrace revolt, but equally few are those who feel invested in the status quo.

""People like Orlov will never take power themselves. But they can help start a fire,"" says Pyotr Kaznacheyev, head of the Youth Anti-Fascist Action Union, a group that monitors extremist politics. ""When the government is weak and the population feels cut off, crazy people can provoke a very harmful process.""

Russia's nationalist camp markets Mr. Orlov as an inspirational pin-up. A big fan is Andrei Fevilov, 28, a former engineer turned writer for the far-right newspaper Zavtra. He last saw Mr. Orlov shortly before a visit to Moscow by U.S. President Bill Clinton, in September, when they met to discuss plans for a protest at the U.S. Embassy. He gushes with admiration for the Red Square bombing. ""This is the beginning of Russia's intifada,"" he claims, referring to the uprising of Palestinians on the West Bank.

Vladimir Putin, the director of the Federal Security Service, says Mr. Orlov probably acted alone but ""reflected the tense situation in the country."" Russia has spawned a plethora of extremist sects, ranging from the pugnacious fanatics of Russian National Unity to the Stalinist zealots of Working Russia.

While none of these groups has attracted a wide following, their violent rhetoric has spread far beyond their own thin ranks. On the day Mr. Orlov drove to Red Square, the Duma, or lower house of parliament, rejected a censure motion against Albert Makashov, a Communist Party legislator who had called for the extermination of Russia's Jews. The head of the Duma's security commission, Viktor Ilyukhin, complains that there are too many Jews in President Yeltsin's inner circle. Nikolai Kondratenko, governor of the southern region of Krasnodar, mutters about ""Zionist nests.""

Opinion polls suggest that such views have little popular support. Over 80% of those polled in a recent survey said they disapproved of Mr. Makashov's remarks. At the same time, attempts to rally the public against anti-Semitism and extremism have fizzled.

Mr. Orlov's second wife last saw him on the morning of the bombing. He left the house early, saying he was going to collect his sister from a town in southern Russia. Shortly before midnight, Federal Security Service agents arrived to tell her about the blast at Spassky Gate. A bomb-disposal team scoured the apartment for traces of explosives.

Of her husband, Nana says: ""Politics poisoned his soul."""
43,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"They didn't call Arthur Chinaka out of the classroom. The principal and Arthur's uncle Simon waited until the day's exams were done before breaking the news: Arthur's father, his body wracked with pneumonia, had finally died of AIDS. They were worried that Arthur would panic, but at 17 years old, he didn't. He still had two days of tests, so while his father lay in the morgue, Arthur finished his exams. That happened in 1990. Then in 1992, Arthur's uncle Edward died of AIDS. In 1994, his uncle Richard died of AIDS. In 1996, his uncle Alex died of AIDS. All of them are buried on the homestead where they grew up and where their parents and Arthur still live, a collection of thatch-roofed huts in the mountains near Mutare, by Zimbabwe's border with Mozambique. But HIV hasn't finished with this family. In April, a fourth uncle lay coughing in his hut, and the virus had blinded Arthur's aunt Eunice, leaving her so thin and weak she couldn't walk without help. By September both were dead.

The most horrifying part of this story is that it is not unique. In Uganda, a business executive named Tonny, who asked that his last name not be used, lost two brothers and a sister to AIDS, while his wife lost her brother to the virus. In the rural hills of South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province, Bonisile Ngema lost her son and daughter-in-law, so she tries to support her granddaughter and her own aged mother by selling potatoes. Her dead son was the breadwinner for the whole extended family, and now she feels like an orphan.

In the morgue of Zimbabwe's Parirenyatwa Hospital, head mortician Paul Tabvemhiri opens the door to the large cold room that holds cadavers. But it's impossible to walk in because so many bodies lie on the floor, wrapped in blankets from their deathbeds or dressed in the clothes they died in. Along the walls, corpses are packed two to a shelf. In a second cold-storage area, the shelves are narrower, so Tabvemhiri faces a grisly choice: He can stack the bodies on top of one another, which squishes the face and makes it hard for relatives to identify the body, or he can leave the cadavers out in the hall, unrefrigerated. He refuses to deform bodies, and so a pair of corpses lie outside on gurneys behind a curtain. The odor of decomposition is faint but clear.

Have they always had to leave bodies in the hall? ""No, no, no,"" says Tabvemhiri, who has worked in the morgue since 1976. ""Only in the last five or six years,"" which is when AIDS deaths here took off. Morgue records show that the number of cadavers has almost tripled since the start of Zimbabwe's epidemic, and there's been a change in who is dying: ""The young ones,"" says Tabvemhiri, ""are coming in bulk.""

The wide crescent of East and Southern Africa that sweeps down from Mount Kenya and around the Cape of Good Hope is the hardest-hit AIDS region in the world. Here, the virus is cutting down more and more of Africa's most energetic and productive people, adults aged 15 to 49. The slave trade also targeted people in their prime, killing or sending into bondage perhaps 25 million people. But that happened over four centuries. Only 17 years have passed since AIDS was first found in Africa, on the shores of Lake Victoria, yet according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the virus has already killed more than 11 million sub-Saharan Africans. More than 22 million others are infected.

Only 10 percent of the world's population lives south of the Sahara, but the region is home to two-thirds of the world's HIV-positive people, and it has suffered more than 80 percent of all AIDS deaths.

Last year, the combined wars in Africa killed 200,000 people. AIDS killed 10 times that number. Indeed, more people succumbed to HIV last year than to any other cause of death on this continent, including malaria. And the carnage has only begun.

Unlike ebola or influenza, AIDS is a slow plague, gestating in individuals for five to 10 years before killing them. Across East and Southern Africa, more than 13 percent of adults are infected with HIV, according to UNAIDS. And in three countries, including Zimbabwe, more than a quarter of adults carry the virus. In some districts, the rates are even higher: In one study, a staggering 59 percent of women attending prenatal clinics in rural Beitbridge, Zimbabwe, tested HIV-positive.

Life expectancy in more than a dozen African countries ""will soon be 17 years shorter because of AIDS-47 years instead of 64,"" says Callisto Madavo, the World Bank's vice president for Africa. HIV ""is quite literally robbing Africa of a quarter of our lives.""

In the West, meanwhile, the HIV death rate has dropped steeply thanks to powerful drug cocktails that keep the disease from progressing. These regimens must be taken for years, probably for life, and they can cost more than $10,000 per patient per year. Yet in many of the hardest-hit African countries, the total per capita health-care budget is less than $10.

Many people-in Africa as well as the West-shrug off this stark disparity, contending that it is also true for other diseases. But it isn't. Drugs for the world's major infectious killers-tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrheal diseases- have been subsidized by the international community for years, as have vaccines for childhood illnesses such as polio and measles. But even at discounted prices, the annual cost of putting every African with HIV on triple combination therapy would exceed $150 billion, so the world is letting a leading infectious killer for which treatment exists mow down millions.

That might be more palatable if there were a Marshall Plan for AIDS prevention to slow the virus's spread. But a recent study by UNAIDS and Harvard shows that in 1997 international donor countries devoted $150 million to AIDS prevention in Africa. That's less than the cost of the movie Wild Wild West.

Meanwhile, the epidemic is seeping into Central and West Africa. More than a tenth of adults in Côte d'Ivoire are infected. Frightening increases have been documented in Yaoundé and Douala, the largest cities in Cameroon. And in Nigeria-the continent's most populous country-past military dictatorships let the AIDS control program wither, even while the prevalence of HIV has climbed to almost one in every 20 adults.

Quite simply, AIDS is on track to dwarf every catastrophe in Africa's recorded history. It is stunting development, threatening the economy, and transforming cultural traditions.

Epidemics are never merely biological. Even as HIV changes African society, it spreads by exploiting current cultural and economic conditions. ""The epidemic gets real only in a context,"" says Elhadj Sy, head of UNAIDS's East and Southern Africa Team. ""In Africa, people wake up in the morning and try to survive-but the way they do that often puts them at risk for infection."" For example, men migrate to cities in search of jobs; away from their wives and families for months on end, they seek sexual release with women who, bereft of property and job skills, are selling their bodies to feed themselves and their children. Back home, wives who ask their husbands to wear condoms risk being accused of sleeping around; in African cultures, it's usually the man who dictates when and how sex happens.

Challenging such cultural and economic forces requires political will, but most African governments have been shockingly derelict. Lacking leadership, ordinary Africans have been slow to confront the disease. Few companies, for example, have comprehensive AIDS programs. And many families still refuse to acknowledge that HIV is killing their relatives, preferring to say that the person died of TB or some other opportunistic illness. Doctors often collude in this denial. ""Just the other day,"" says a high-ranking Zimbabwean physician who spoke on condition of anonymity, ""I wrote AIDS on a death certificate and then crossed it out. I thought, 'I'll just be stigmatizing this person, because no one else puts AIDS as the cause of death, even when that's what it is.' ""

Why is AIDS worse in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else in the world? Partly because of denial; partly because the virus almost certainly originated here, giving it more time to spread; but largely because Africa was weakened by 500 years of slavery and colonialism. Indeed, historians lay much of the blame on colonialism for Africa's many corrupt and autocratic governments, which hoard resources that could fight the epidemic. Africa, conquered and denigrated, was never allowed to incorporate international innovations on its own terms, as, for example, Japan did.

This colonial legacy poisons more than politics. Some observers attribute the spread of HIV to polygamy, a tradition in many African cultures. But job migration, urbanization, and social dislocation have created a caricature of traditional polygamy. Men have many partners not through marriage but through prostitution or sugar-daddy arrangements that lack the social glue of the old polygamy.

Of course, the worst legacy of whites in Africa is poverty, which fuels the epidemic in countless ways. Having a sexually transmitted disease multiplies the chances of spreading and contracting HIV, but few Africans obtain effective treatment because the clinic is too expensive or too far away. Africa's wealth was either funneled to the West or restricted to white settlers who barred blacks from full participation in the economy. In apartheid South Africa, blacks were either not educated at all or taught only enough to be servants. Now, as the country suffers one of the world's most explosive AIDS epidemics, illiteracy hampers prevention. Indeed, AIDS itself is rendering Africa still more vulnerable to any future catastrophe, continuing history's vicious cycle.

Yet AIDS is not merely a tale of despair. Increasingly, Africans are banding together- usually with meager resources-to care for their sick, raise their orphans, and prevent the virus from claiming more of their loved ones. Their efforts offer hope. For while a crisis of this magnitude can disintegrate society, it can also unify it. ""To solve HIV,"" says Sy, ""you must involve yourself: your attitudes and behavior and beliefs. It touches upon the most fundamental social and cultural things-procreation and death.""

AIDS is driving a new candor about sex-as well as new efforts to control it, through virginity testing and campaigns that advocate sticking to one partner. And slowly, fitfully, it is also giving women more power. The death toll is scaring women into saying no to sex or insisting on condoms. And as widows proliferate, people are beginning to see the harm in denying them the right to inherit property.

The epidemic is also transforming kinship networks, which have been the heart of most African cultures. Orphans, for example, have always been enfolded into the extended family. But more than 7 million children in sub-Saharan Africa have lost one or both parents, and the virus is also killing their aunts and uncles, depriving them of foster parents and leaving them to live with often feeble grandparents. In response, communities across Africa are volunteering to help orphans through home visits and, incredibly, by sharing the very little they have. Such volunteerism is both a reclaiming of communal traditions and their adaptation into new forms of civil society.

But even heroic efforts can't stop the damage that's already occurred here in the hills where Arthur Chinaka lost his father and uncles. The worst consequence of this epidemic is not the dead, but the living they leave behind.

Rusina Kasongo lives a couple of hills over from Chinaka. Like a lot of elderly rural folk who never went to school, Kasongo can't calculate how old she is, but she can count her losses: Two of her sons, one of her daughters, and all their spouses died of AIDS, and her husband died in an accident. Alone, she is rearing 10 orphaned children.

""Sometimes the children go out and come home very late,"" says Kasongo, ""and I'm afraid they'll end up doing the same thing as Tanyaradzwa."" That's the daughter who died of AIDS; she had married twice, the first time in a shotgun wedding. Now, the eldest orphan, 17-year-old Fortunate, already has a child but not a husband.

Few people have conducted more research on AIDS orphans than pediatrician Geoff Foster, who founded the Family AIDS Caring Trust (FACT). It was Foster who documented that more than half of Zimbabwe's orphans are being cared for by grandparents, usually grandmothers who had nursed their own children to the grave. But even this fragile safety net won't be there for many of the next generation of orphans.

""Perhaps one-third of children in Zimbabwe will have lost a father or mother-or both-to AIDS,"" says Foster. They are more likely to be poor, he explains, more likely to be deprived of education, more likely to be abused or neglected or stigmatized, more likely to be seething with all the needs that make it more likely that a person will have unsafe sex. ""But when they get HIV and die, who cares for their children? Nobody, because they're orphans, so by definition their kids have no grandparents. It's just like the virus itself. In the body, HIV gets into the defense system and knocks it out. It does that sociologically, too. It gets into the extended family support system and decimates it.""

Foster's chilling realization is dawning on other people who work in fields far removed from HIV. This year, South African crime researcher Martin Schönteich published a paper that begins by noting, ""In a decade's time every fourth South African will be aged between 15 and 24. It is at this age group where people's propensity to commit crime is at its highest. At about the same time there will be a boom in South Africa's orphan population as the Aids epidemic takes its toll."" While some causes of crime can be curtailed, Schönteich writes, ""Other causes, such as large numbers of juveniles in the general population, and a high proportion of children brought up without adequate parental supervision, are beyond the control of the state."" His conclusion: ""No amount of state spending on the criminal justice system will be able to counter this harsh reality.""

More AIDS and more crime are among the most dramatic consequences of the orphan explosion. But Nengomasha Willard sees damage that is harder to measure. Willard teaches 11-and 12-year-olds at Saint George's Primary School, located near the Chinakas and the Kasongos. Fifteen of Willard's 42 pupils have lost one or both of their parents, but he's particularly worried about one of his students who lost his father and then, at his mother's funeral, cried inconsolably. ""He doesn't want to participate,"" says Willard. ""He just wants to be alone.""

""I see thousands of children sitting in a corner,"" says Foster. ""The impact is internalized-it's depression, being withdrawn."" In Africa, says Foster, the focus on poverty eclipses research into psychological issues, but he has published disturbing evidence of abuse-emotional, physical, and sexual. Meanwhile, the orphan ranks keep swelling. ""We're talking 10 percent who will have lost both parents, maybe 15 percent. Twenty-five percent who will have lost a mother. What does that do to a society, especially an impoverished society?""

Among his students, Willard has noticed that some of the orphans come to school without shoes or, in Zimbabwe's cold winter, without a sweater. Sometimes their stepfamilies put them last on the list, but often it's because grandmothers can't scrape together enough money.

Among economists, there has been a quiet debate over whether HIV will harm the economy. Some think it won't. With unemployment rates in sub-Saharan Africa between 30 and 70 percent, they reason that there are plenty of people to replenish labor losses. One scenario is that economic growth might slacken, but population growth will also dwindle, so per capita GNP might hold steady or even rise. Then, says Helen Jackson, executive director of the Southern Africa AIDS Information Dissemination Service (SAfAIDS), Africa might face the grotesque irony of ""an improvement in some macroeconomic indicators, but the exact opposite at the level of households and human suffering.""

But evidence is mounting that the economy will suffer. Between 20 and 30 percent of workers in South Africa's gold mining industry-the mainstay of that country's economy-are estimated to be HIV-positive, and replacing these workers will cut into the industry's productivity. In Kenya, a new government report predicts that per capita income could sink by 10 percent over the next five years. In Côte d'Ivoire, a teacher dies every school day.

Then there are the effects that can't be quantified. ""What does AIDS do for the image of Africa?"" asks Tony Barnett, a veteran researcher on the economic impact of AIDS. To lure investors, the continent already has to battle underdevelopment and racism, but now, he says, many people will see Africa as ""diseased, sexually diseased. It chimes in with so many stereotypes.""

Beneath the corporate economy, millions of Africans subsist by cultivating their own small plot of land. When someone in the family comes down with AIDS, the other members have to spend time caring for that person, which means less time cultivating crops. And when death comes, the family loses a crucial worker. Studies have documented that among rural AIDS-stricken families, food production falls, savings dwindle, and children are more likely to be undernourished.

For Kasongo and her 10 orphans, food is a constant problem, but now it has become even harder. On her way back from the fields, carrying a basket of maize on her head, Kasongo tripped and fell. Her knee is swollen, her back is aching, and cultivating the fields is close to impossible. Here, under the radar of macroeconomic indicators, Kasongo's ordeal shows how AIDS is devastating Africa.

This is the context in which one of Africa's most agonizing debates is taking place: Should doctors administer drugs to pregnant women that sharply reduce the chances that a baby will be born with HIV? So far, the debate has centered on the cost of the drugs, but a new, inexpensive regimen has pushed thornier arguments to the surface.

The ""vaccine for babies,"" as it is sometimes called, does not treat the mother and so does nothing to reduce the chances the baby will become an orphan. That's why Uganda's Major Rubaramira Ruranga, a well-known activist who is himself infected with HIV, opposes it. ""Many children in our countries die of malnutrition, even with both parents,"" he argues. ""Without parents, it's almost certain they'll die.""

Isn't it impossible to know the fate of any given child and presumptuous to decide it in advance? ""That's sentimental,"" he snaps. Even Foster, who believes ""every child has a right to be born without HIV,"" wonders whether the money is best spent on the ""technical fix"" of giving drugs to the pregnant women. The medicine is only a part of the cost, for women can infect their children during breast feeding, which raises expensive problems such as providing formula and teaching mothers how to use it safely in places where clean water may not exist. Would all that money, Foster wonders, be better spent alleviating the root causes of why women get infected in the first place? ""It's very difficult to stand up and make such an argument because you get portrayed as a beast,"" he says. In fact, such arguments testify to how the epidemic is forcing Africans to grapple with impossible choices.

Weston Tizora is one of thousands of Africans who are trying to give orphans a decent life. Just 25 years old, Tizora started as a gardener at Saint Augustine's Mission and threw himself into volunteering in the mission's AIDS program, called Kubatana, a Shona word meaning ""together."" Next year he will take over the program's leadership from its founder, British nurse Sarah Hinton. Kubatana's 37 volunteers care for homebound patients, and they help raise orphans by, for example, bringing food to Rusina Kasongo's brood.

Just a few steps from Kasongo live Cloud and Joseph Tineti. They're 14 and 11, respectively, and the oldest person in their home is their 15-year-old brother. They are, in the language of AIDS workers, a child-headed household. Who's in charge? ""No one,"" Joseph answers-and it shows. Their one-room shack is strewn with dirty clothes, unwashed dishes, broken chairs. On the table, a roiling mass of ants feasts on pumpkin seeds and some kind of dried leaves.

The troubles run deeper. Their father, who had divorced their mother before she died, lives in nearby Mutare. Does he bring food? ""Yes,"" says Joseph, ""every week."" It's not true, Tizora maintains. Kubatana members have even talked with the police in their effort to convince the father to take in his children or at least support them. But the police did not act, explains Tizora, because the father is unemployed and struggling to provide for the family of his second wife. Once a month-sometimes not even that often-he brings small amounts of food, so the orphans depend on donations from Kubatana volunteers.

But if little Joseph's version isn't true, it's what an orphaned kid would want: a father who at least brings food, stops by frequently, and acts a little like a dad. And his mother: What does Joseph remember of her? The question is too much, and he starts crying.

Kubatana volunteers are supposed to look after the Tineti orphans, so why is their home so unkempt? There used to be two volunteers in this area, explains Tizora. One has been reassigned to work in the nearby mining village, ravaged by AIDS. The other has been away at her parents' home for two months, attending to a family funeral and to her own late-stage pregnancy.

And everyone in these villages has their hands full. Standing in a valley, Tizora points to the hillsides around him and says, ""There are orphans in that home, and the one over there, and there by the gum trees. And see where there's that white house? They're taking care of orphans there, too."" By the time he finishes, he has pointed out about half of the homesteads. When the Kubatana program started, in 1992, volunteers identified 20 orphans. Now they have registered 3000. In many parts of Africa, notes Jackson of SAfAIDS, ""It has actually become the norm to have orphaned children in the household rather than the exception.""

Foster makes some quick calculations: Given the number of volunteers in the Kubatana program, there's no way they can care for all their orphans. So when a volunteer gets pregnant, has a family emergency, or gets sick, kids like Cloud and Joseph fall through the cracks. Says Foster: ""You can't lose a quarter of your adult population in 10 years without catastrophic consequences.""

In his office, Tizora has a wall of photographs showing the original 20 orphans. One is a girl who looks about 12. She lost her parents and then she lost the grandma who was caring for her. At that point, she started refusing to go to school, hiding on the way there. Now, she's run away and, Tizora says, ""we don't know where she is."""
44,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"This is not an easy country, but Lagos, Nigeria's teeming megacity, is almost fantastical in its difficulties. Rarely do 24 hours pass without a blackout, and power outages lasting weeks are common. Officially, NEPA stands for National Electric Power Authority, but everyone jokes that it stands for Never Expect Power Anytime, so those who can afford it own a diesel generator. But that's not a guarantee, because even though Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil producers, mismanagement causes frequent fuel shortages: One AIDS researcher lost 3000 refrigerated blood samples when a power outage and a fuel shortage coincided.

Running water? Even wealthy Lagosians often lack it; they pay for trucks to fill up large tanks. Doctors wash their hands with water from buckets. Calling the police is virtually impossible, because even if your phone is working the one in the police station probably isn't. Military dictatorships have plundered Nigeria for most of the 39 years since the country wrested its independence from Britain, and a favorite scam of ""the military boys,"" as they are called, was to transfer government contract money into private Swiss bank accounts and pay off cronies to sign forms stating that, yes, the work had been completed even though anyone with eyes could see that nothing at all had been done. Directors of private companies often award contracts to the highest briber, and many Lagos buildings feature signs warning, ""This house not for sale"" because con men sell homes they don't own.

What can be relied on in Lagos? The heat. The pollution. The epic traffic jams called ""go-slows"" that trap millions of commuters for hours, most of them sweltering inside crowded minivan taxis. And Fela.

Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the international music star who married 27 women in one day and who usually appeared on stage with nothing but his sax, the skimpiest briefs, and a joint that, as one writer put it, was the size of a small African nation-Fela championed African culture over all things white and he fearlessly excoriated the military governments that were ransacking Nigeria. Foolishly, the state boosted his standing by giving him the dissident's ultimate seal of credibility: jail time. During this year's democratic elections, which brought former military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo back into power, Fela's song ""Soldier Go, Soldier Come"" could be heard everywhere, accusing Obasanjo and the rest of the military boys of operating a revolving door to power.

But during the election, that song was never heard live, because Fela died in 1997 of a disease he claimed didn't exist, and certainly not in Africa: AIDS. No matter that Fela's older brother, Professor Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, had served as the country's health minister and launched Nigeria's much-lauded early AIDS program. About the only concession Fela made to white medicine was to let Olikoye stitch up his head after the police had gashed it. There was hardly an illness African herbs couldn't cure, Fela maintained, and he dismissed condoms as unnatural, unpleasurable, and a white plot to reduce the black birthrate. He believed, says Olikoye, that ""all doctors were fabricating AIDS, including myself.""

By the time Fela allowed himself to be taken to a hospital, he was so far gone he never heard the test results confirming that he was infected with HIV. A few days later, deep in a coma, he choked on his own vomit and died.

Then began the fight for Fela's death-and, in a way, for Nigeria's life. Astoundingly popular, Fela carried the potential to do for AIDS in Nigeria what Rock Hudson, Magic Johnson, and Arthur Ashe accomplished in America.

Fela's most ardent fans-such as the legions of out-of-school, unemployed ""area boys"" who deal, steal, and occasionally riot to get a little cash-are often the groups most vulnerable to HIV. They are also the most alienated from society and authority, including doctors. Many area boys refuse to believe Fela died of AIDS, and their response reveals the complex forms that AIDS denial takes in urban Africa.

It also illuminates an impending holocaust. Nigeria's most recent national statistics, issued in 1996, estimate that almost one in 20 adults are infected. That's already perilously high, especially since Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, home to one in every seven Africans. What if Nigeria's HIV prevalence rises to the level of some East and Southern African countries, where more than a quarter of adults are HIV-positive? Then, warns veteran Nigerian AIDS activist Pearl Nwashili, ""what we have seen in the rest of Africa will be child's play.""

Yet Nigeria's efforts to fight AIDS remain mired in what Nwashili calls ""apathy and denial."" Not even the blood supply is safe, because many of the country's numerous private clinics transfuse unscreened blood. Monitoring them is virtually impossible, largely because the once vigorous National AIDS and STD Control Program has been limping along on 40 million naira a year, which is less than half a million U.S. dollars. And the country's official rate of HIV is widely believed to be underestimated, partly because it was calculated with no data whatsoever from Lagos, sub-Saharan Africa's largest metropolis, a cauldron of at least 8 million inhabitants that swells by almost a thousand newcomers every day.

Like so many of Africa's megacities, Lagos is linked with the rest of the country through the extended families of these immigrants, and through the road, rail, sea, and air routes that converge here. Controlling AIDS in Lagos, therefore, is critical to controlling AIDS in Nigeria as a whole. But while only a united, all-out effort can contain Nigeria's epidemic, the country remains gripped by a schizophrenic attitude toward AIDS, epitomized by brothers Olikoye and Fela: on the one hand, a face-the-facts pragmatism; on the other, a denial that is rooted in anti-white, pan-African ideology.

Resistance to the facts of Fela's death reared up almost before his corpse had cooled. ""Fela's doctor came to me and said, 'What should I write as the cause of death?' "" Olikoye recalls. ""And I said, 'What did you find he died of?' She said it would be too terrible to write it-AIDS is such a shame. So I asked her, 'Are you going to forge a death certificate?'"" The doctor relented.

The next day, flanked by most of Fela's family, Olikoye staged a press conference, announced that AIDS had killed his brother, and delivered what Fela's daughter Yeni calls ""a serious lecture,"" pointing out that almost 2 million Nigerians were already carrying the AIDS virus and that people needed to confront the crisis.

The announcement certainly jolted some people. There are prostitutes who say that more of their johns started wearing condoms after Olikoye's announcement. But millions-including Fela's youngest son, 16-year-old Seun-don't believe HIV felled their hero. Hanging out in a crowded alley, area boy and staunch Fela fan Bob ""Marlboro"" Kuforiji says, in a typical comment, ""It's just propaganda to say Fela died of AIDS."" His logic: ""Fela's a very great man, so he couldn't have died of AIDS."" Condoms? Marlboro doesn't use them.

Virtually every big city has bands of street toughs, but area boys are a phenomenon unique to Lagos, where they have attained almost mythic status as urban nuisance and criminal menace. They riot to intimidate whole neighborhoods into paying them off, or just to loot. Politicians employ them to attack opponents or create a diversion-but ultimately the area boys answer to no one. This summer, in what the papers dubbed ""jungle justice,"" area boys fought turf battles against rival gangs and against citizen vigilante groups fed up with their crimes and with police impotence. More than 50 people were killed, often burned alive.

Victor Inem, a doctor at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, studied 113 area boys and, though few locals use the term, area girls. Twenty-eight percent tested HIV-positive, an infection rate second only to sex workers. And that was six years ago. There have been virtually no other studies of area boys, but today's infection rate would almost certainly be higher, in part because the area boys act in ways that put themselves and others at risk. More than half of the women in Inem's study had prostituted themselves. Both sexes engaged in ""sessions,"" drug binges that often included orgies. And one way they got cash for drugs and food was to sell their blood to private clinics-a practice that, according to AIDS workers and area boys alike, still continues.

""We saved millions of children with immunizations and child diarrhea treatment,"" says Olikoye, ""but we never did much to plan for their future. They have no jobs, no schooling. They are selling scraps on the street, and they are beyond the reach of anyone.""

Except Fela. He took scores of prostitutes and area boys off the streets, giving them a home in his commune, called Kalakuta Republic, and giving himself unmatched street credibility. But more than that, he transfigured their roiling frustration and sense of betrayal into art-their art. Fela's cousin, Wole Soyinka, may have won the Nobel Prize, but Fela, singing in Pidgin, won the devotion of people at the butt of Nigeria's tragic history.

Fela's music linked high-level corruption to the everyday sufferings of Lagos life, from conditions in the city's slums-where, he sang, ""dey stay ten-ten in one room"" and ""sleep inside dustbin""-to the almost allegorical torments of the molue,the sweltering, overcrowded Lagos busses. ""Every day my people dey inside bus, 49 sitting 99 standing, dem go pack themselves in like sardines, dem dey faint."" These lyrics evoke ""images of the slave trade,"" notes Babatope Babalobi, a member of Journalists Against AIDS who wrote his college thesis on Fela. Area boys say simply, ""Fela was talking the truth.""

So it is a cruel irony that his downfall was caused by self-deception. The humor in his dismissal of condoms-""After I remove my trouser,"" he was fond of saying, ""why I got to wear trouser for prick?""-has become grotesque as the AIDS epidemic swells into one of the worst tragedies in Africa's history. Fela was risking his own life, but he was also risking the lives of his partners, many of whom were the street girls he took into his home. Fela was often criticized for his views on women-""Woman got no other role than making the man happy,"" he once said-but HIV armed his attitude with the potential to kill.

Indeed, life at Fela's Kalakuta Republic was a safe-sex educator's nightmare. The air was hazy with marijuana smoke, and hot-Nigerian street gin-flowed freely. Fela's oldest son, Femi, remembers that ""the whole compound was dirty,"" and not one of the area boys who took shelter there ""was doing anything constructive.""

Femi, who like his dad plays the sax and has a successful band of his own, Positive Force, swore off pot because, he explains, ""I can't do what my father did. I have to work more than play."" That work ethic, not to mention the notion of no more pot, has made him unpopular with the city toughs. And, Femi comes as close as a son can to blaming his father for colluding in the collective tragedy of the area boys: ""They want me to act like my father to support the way they are ruining their lives.""

Fela did support the behaviors that help to spread HIV. But perhaps more damaging, he sanctioned an attitude that makes it extremely difficult to change those ways.

Dominating Ojuelegbao Lane in the Surulere district of Lagos is a cement apartment block, laundry hanging off the balconies, several windows broken. Below it cluster small cement shacks with corrugated iron roofs. Stagnant water sits in the open sewers, and chickens peck among the garbage, squawking and fluttering to avoid the running, all-but-naked children. Lounging shirtless in an alley, area boy Thomas ""Boy-O-Boy"" Edem, who used to live in Fela's commune, insists he doesn't steal. ""That's why I deal in this,"" he says, holding up a plastic bag bulging with marijuana. His other revenue stream comes from the nearby bus stop. During the evening rush hour Boy-O-Boy darts through the chaos, collecting hisdash,slang for a payoff. Like mafia protection money, the payment keeps the area boys from attacking the busses.

No one is exempt from such extortion, certainly not AIDS workers, who are perceived as being rich because they are funded by international donor agencies. Onemtein Amadi of the Nigerian Youth AIDS Programme (NYAP) recalls a soccer league, organized by her agency, in which the requirement for participation was taking an AIDS course and competing in halftime AIDS quizzes. Sixteen teams totaling more than 400 players signed up, but NYAP hadn't settled with the area boys. ""They would move onto the field and disrupt the match,"" she recalls. ""They'd say, 'If you don't give us money and gin, the match won't go on.'"" NYAP ended up hiring the area boys as security guards, a job they relished.

This is the simplest form of what Amadi calls ""the money syndrome,"" a corrosive blend of cynicism and mistrust that comes from a culture where corruption is king and poverty forces hard deals. Elvira Obike, program officer for the Lagos chapter of The Society of Women against AIDS in Africa, estimates that ""more than 70 percent of female university students engage in sex for money to pay school fees,"" almost always with older sugar daddies. In a culture where so many are prostituting themselves, and where leaders steal millions and sometimes billions of dollars, everyone has an angle. And Fela stoked this cynicism.

While it was always clear what he was against, no one could say precisely what Fela was for. He was pure dissident. His brother Olikoye brought primary care to Nigeria's poor, but Fela criticized him for serving in a military government. Fela's rejection of virtually everything white-including Western medicine-was fundamentally reactionary, a wholesale backlash against white rule. It may have been fatal, but in urban Africa, it is a common response. In fact, it is one of colonialism's legacies.

Fela did espouse notions of freedom and equality and African unity, but they were nebulous, little more than slogans. Meanwhile, he ruled his commune like a king, meting out harsh beatings to errant area boys and indulging his legendary appetite for marijuana and sex. Fela made it seem that all it took to be a revolutionary was to pursue one's own gratification and blame the powers that be.

Such cynicism undermines AIDS education. As NYAP's Edem Effiong explains, ""people might not believe accurate information about AIDS, because they might not trust the source."" Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a source more credible than Olikoye, one of the very few government ministers who has retained a good reputation. It doesn't matter. Marlboro is only one of many who thinks Olikoye was lying about the cause of Fela's death. Asked why Olikoye would claim his own brother died of AIDS when he hadn't, Marlboro replies, ""Nigerians will do anything because of money, even sell our mother and father."" Olikoye was paid off, people say, by the World Bank or the Americans.

It's also common to hear blanket dismissals of Western medicine. A bus conductor, who loved Fela's music and went to his funeral, is sure Feladidn't die of AIDS ""because the man took care of himself. He used traditional, tribal ways."" Does he believe AIDS is real? ""I'm hearing this, but I don't believe it."" A teenager, dressed in his school uniform, interjects to say he's read a pamphlet saying that AIDS was invented by the Americans because they want to dominate the world.

Some people, including Fela's daughter, think the government should have used her father's death to launch an AIDS program. But others think that would have backfired. ""If the government had tried using Fela, there would have been trouble,"" says NYAP's Effiong. She thinks it would only have hardened the refusal to believe that AIDS is real.

AIDS came very late to Nigeria. The first case was reported in 1986, four years after the disease was first identified in Africa, and even then, study after study showed the virus was not widespread. While this gave Nigeria time, it also played into the hands of those who denied the existence or gravity of AIDS, because almost nobody was dying. Even now, those who are reaching the last stages of the disease were infected six to 10 years ago, so they are relatively few-unlike malaria, a clear and present killer. So activists such as Nwashili of STOPAIDS have toiled at ""trying to make people believe there is AIDS when there is no AIDS.""

There are signs of hope. Nigeria's new president may have a checkered past, but he has almost tripled the AIDS Programme budget, committed his government to dealing with the epidemic-something his corrupt predecessors failed to do-and called in international assistance. Olikoye supported the new president's election (even though his police raided Fela's home in 1977 and inflicted injuries that killed their mother) because Obasanjo ""has a wicked streak, which we need in Nigeria."" Olikoye is also leading an energetic advocacy effort. And at the Iddo motor park, a vast and crowded bustling truck stop, STOPAIDS peer educator Robert Eselojor is optimistic. ""Now the drivers aren't taking women, or they are using condoms.""

But that's not how the younger guys hanging out at the motor park tell it. To the hearty laughter of everyone around, a burly driver says he doesn't wear condoms because ""if I put it on, my prick can't rise."" Another man in the group blames AIDS on ""irresponsible girls"" and waves his arm in the direction of the brothels. ""The only risk is around them,"" he insists. ""A responsible woman cannot get AIDS.""

At the base of the Carter Bridge in the crowded, crime-ridden Idumota area, a group of women hawks petty merchandise-cigarettes, soap, fruit. Do their partners use condoms? They just laugh. ""My husband,"" says one, ""can't use a condom because he's not a eunuch."" Do their husbands have girlfriends on the side? ""Two that I know of,"" answers the first. ""My husband is very religious so he has none,"" says a third woman, wearing a headscarf. ""But,"" she adds, ""my boyfriend has had up to 30 other girls.""

At the pink-painted Royal Crown Hotel, a sex worker who gives her name as Tina, says many johns offer extra money for unsheathed sex. Trained as a peer educator by the Lagos chapter of the Society of Women against AIDS in Africa, Tina insists she doesn't accept those offers. But, she adds, ""I can't lie. Some of the girls, especially the younger ones, if they see 1000 naira, they can't leave it."" So how many sex workers use a condom every time? Among the older ones, estimates Tina, six out of 10. But among the younger ones, only two or three out of 10.

Fela wouldn't have solved Nigeria's AIDS problem. But like the Congo's wildly popular Franco Luambo or Uganda's Philly Lutaya, both of whom recorded songs warning about AIDS shortly before the disease killed them, Fela could have made every Nigerian feel that they knew someone with HIV, thus bypassing the process of waiting for the death toll to scare people into taking precautions. As it is, Olikoye believes his brother symbolizes Nigeria's denial and, he says, ""I don't know how we will get over the barrier of convincing people that HIV is real.""

Over in the Lagos slum of Makoko, where fishing people have constructed a watery shantytown on stilts, 21-year-old Frank Ogbonnaya says he's slept with four women over the last year, and while he maintains that he usually uses condoms with his casual partners, he never uses them with his steady girlfriend. AIDS, he says, just isn't a big concern. Does he know anyone with the disease? ""I don't know anyone,"" he replies, ""unless you count Fela. And I don't believe Fela died of AIDS."""
45,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"Wilson was the hardest. He had been such a charmer, a flirt even, but then AIDS dulled his sparkle and confined him to his bed. That's when Sibongile Ndlovu increased her visits to every day, bringing him food and caring for his bedsores, which had bloomed into an affliction worthy of Job. 'The whole skin on his side was coming off,' she says, and it filled his hut with the smell of sickness. She convinced the clinic to give her medicine, and she rubbed the ointment on his raw bedsores every day for the two months until he died.

Four years have passed, but despite that ordeal Ndlovu is still caring for patients. How many has she assisted? ""Forty-two,"" she says, checking a tattered ledger with neat, handscripted notes. How many have died? ""Sixteen.""

Ndlovu is not a nurse or health-care professional of any kind. She is a peasant farmer who volunteers with the Insiza Godlwayo AIDS Council (IGAC). Her family income is about 300 Zimbabwe dollars a month, not even 10 U.S. dollars. Three days a week--more if one of her patients is severely ill--she stops by the homes of the sick, washing their bedclothes, fetching water, tilling the little plots of land on which these villagers all survive, even parting with some of her meager income to purchase things her patients need. Wilson had a craving for oranges, which are luxury items here. But she bought them.

Africa's response to AIDS is often depicted to be as dysfunctional as its economy, just another example of what some AIDS workers call ""Afro-pessimism""--only bad news coming out of Africa. It is true that just a handful of African governments have mobilized a response remotely commensurate with the magnitude of the epidemic, which has already slashed life expectancy by as much as 20 years in some countries. AIDS stigma has also made many ordinary people shy away from dealing with the epidemic. ""I have found the most unacceptable denial and apathy in Africa,"" says Elhadj Sy, who heads the southern and eastern Africa team for UNAIDS. ""But on the other hand, the most incredible responses to HIV have been developed here. We live in this contradiction of extremes.""

Nowhere are these extremes more pronounced than in Zimbabwe, the former Rhodesia, which whites ruled until 1980. When it finally gained independence, Zimbabwe was the South Africa of its day--relatively prosperous, with no foreign debt, and a currency stronger than the U.S. dollar. Now, the economy is in free-fall, and a quarter of adults in the prime of life, aged 15 to 49, are infected with HIV. The virus is killing more than 65,000 people a year.

Yet the director of Zimbabwe's National AIDS Coordination Programme, Everisto Marowa, says that government spending on AIDS prevention has, in real terms, ""certainly not increased and probably declined"" over the last five years. Last month, the government announced a special AIDS tax, but even AIDS workers criticized the idea because the government provided no plans on how it would spend the money. Corruption and mismanagement are rife in Zimbabwe, and previous special levies have disappeared with no accounting.

Meanwhile, the government admits it is spending more than 70 times the budget of the AIDS Programme on its unpopular military intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, though independent observers estimate the war costs many times more than that. Few citizens understand why a third of the army has been deployed in the civil war of a country that does not even border their own, especially when inflation and unemployment in Zimbabwe both exceed 50 percent. But many suspect a few may be profiteering: The head of Zimbabwe's army is a director of one company that has mining rights to the mineral-rich Congo and of another that has trucking rights.

Yet below the radar of government, in individual communities there are astonishingly vigorous responses to AIDS. ""In every province we have member organizations,"" says Thembeni Mahlangu, director of the Zimbabwe AIDS Network. ""They were often started by a church or NGO [nongovernmental organization] and sometimes just by individuals."" For example, Auxilia Chimusoro founded Zimbabwe's first AIDS support group, and then tirelessly traveled the country launching more. By the time she died in 1998, Chimusoro had started more than 50 support groups, most in poor rural communities. In the capital, Harare, the Musasa Project works with battered women, helping them break free of partners who often force them to have sex, almost always without a condom.

IGAC, the group that helped Wilson, specializes in home-based care and orphan support, and it has recently launched a youth prevention campaign. The leadership of most AIDS programs ""is composed of professionals,"" says Lucia Malemane, a nurse with Zimbabwe's Matabeleland AIDS Council, who taught Insiza about AIDS. ""But with IGAC, it's just ordinary peasant farmers.""

Heroic as these efforts may be, they are tinged with poignancy--and not just because the government, which could knit these isolated efforts into a powerful national response, has shirked its duty. Most community programs lack any but the most basic medicines. Certainly they cannot afford the expensive regimens that have reduced the AIDS death rate in wealthy countries. Without effective drugs, home-based care can seem like little more than home-based death. With the disease mowing down so many people, and with poverty making volunteering so burdensome, it remains to be seen whether such homespun efforts can endure for the decades that may well pass before an AIDS vaccine is developed.

But for the moment, thousands of ordinary Africans are defying all odds to care for their sick, raise their orphans, and try to slow the virus's spread. If governments finally mobilize against this disease, they will find some of the best and most energetic AIDS strategies right under their noses.

And they might find something else. Traditionally, Africans relied on extended families and tight communities to weather adversity, but even before AIDS, colonialism, urbanization, and social atomization had weakened the sinews of African society. The epidemic threatens to snap them--but it could also have the opposite effect. ""AIDS is horrible, but in times of great stress societies can either fall apart or come together,"" says Alan Whiteside, who studies the demographic impact of AIDS at South Africa's University of Natal. Noting how the American gay community built powerful institutions and a stronger culture, he says that ""IGAC, with a little help, could be an example of building civil society in Africa.""

There are few places where the difficulties of responding to AIDS are more daunting than here in Insiza, a flat, dry district of southern Zimbabwe punctuated by dramatic rock formations and dotted with imizi, rural homesteads composed of neatly ordered round huts. Villagers here are so poor that most don't bury their dead in coffins, but merely wrap them in blankets. At one funeral, near the start of Zimbabwe's winter, the grieving family was so destitute that, after lowering the body into the grave, they started removing the blanket from the corpse so their children wouldn't go cold. Stricken with pity and horror, IGAC's coordinator Japhet Gwebu gave the family a blanket.

Only about half of Insiza's population can read and write, and what schools there are often lack even furniture, forcing students to work on the floor. The district hospital is supposed to have five doctors, but on a recent visit, it had only one, and the operating theater was closed because the hospital had run out of anesthetics. Nurses are also in short supply--but not patients, who have poured in over and above capacity.

Frequent droughts cause starvation. The 1992 drought killed most of the cattle, which means that even though the rains were good this year many prime fields lay untilled because there are no beasts of burden to pull the plows. Nobody, of course, has tractors or automobiles. How many residents have electricity or running water? Fidres Manombe, chief executive officer of the district council, laughs at the question. ""Oh, it's negligible,"" he says.

Back in the late 1980s, when a new disease began causing people to waste into skin-shrouded skeletons, most people in Insiza believed the affliction was caused by witchcraft. Only in 1994 did they learn the medical facts, and immediately a group of elders decided they needed to do something to care for the droves of sick people and the swelling number of orphans. But how to organize the villagers?

Homesteads are scattered far apart, yet throughout the district's 7500 square kilometers--an area larger than Delaware--there is only one paved road. Nobody has telephones. Isaiah Ndlovu, one of IGAC's founders and most active leaders, has never even heard of e-mail, but he sometimes sends messages by relay, villagers passing on his communiqué so that by the end of the day it has traveled across the vast farmland to its intended recipient--if someone hasn't misunderstood the message or forgotten it completely. So to mobilize his community, Ndlovu must visit homesteads one by one, and that's how he keeps the program going, checking in on the volunteers and the dying people they're caring for.

To any destination closer than 10 miles, Ndlovu just walks. When he has to catch the one and only bus that serves his village, the 56-year-old rises at 3:45 a.m. and trudges 45 minutes in the dark to the bus stop, an unmarked patch of grass by the unpaved main road. Delays of eight hours are not uncommon. ""But,"" Ndlovu says, standing in a winter drizzle one morning when the bus was already long past due, ""it's better for the bus to be late than you to be late for the bus.""

Today, five years after its founding, IGAC has 500 active volunteers and at least another 500 who help out as needed. To put this in perspective, New York's largest AIDS organization, Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), had 500 home-care volunteers in 1994, just before new drugs lowered the death rate. With a budget exceeding $24 million, GMHC rewards its volunteers with parties and other perks. IGAC has an annual budget of less than $17,000, and volunteers, though they are dirt poor, are asked to pay dues. The volunteers also give directly to their patients, bringing tomatoes or soap, candles or ground maize, which Zimbabweans eat at virtually every meal. ""It's not every time that we can bring something,"" explains Kelina Ncube, one of the volunteers. ""We just give them some of whatever we have to eat that day.""

All this giving takes its toll. ""When we started it was easy going,"" says Ndlovu. ""But as we go along, some are starting to say, 'We have contributed too much.""' Indeed, at a meeting, one woman asks if she and the other volunteers can be compensated. Some of this may be bellyaching--""we have different characters,"" says Ndlovu, dryly--but most of the complaints stem from brute poverty. ""We have to nurse sick people and handle food for them, so we need to wash with soap,"" he explains. ""But soap is very, very expensive."" In Zimbabwe, a bar costs the equivalent of 20 cents.

""In the U.S. you have all these volunteers, but they're never worrying about putting food on the table,"" says Noerine Kaleeba, who launched Africa's first support group for HIV-positive people, The AIDS Support Organisation of Uganda. To keep volunteers going, Kaleeba says, some African communities have planted a special garden from which only volunteers can harvest, or created a fund that pays the school fees of their children. (Zimbabwe, like most African nations, does not provide free education.)

It is often said that Africans are passive in the face of death and suffering, that life is cheap here. The truth is that life is hard. People are so poor that even when they give a large proportion of their income, as most IGAC volunteers do, the total amounts to only a small sum--so small that even bare-bones efforts are hard to launch and maintain. Groups like IGAC are ""isolated and scattered blossoms,"" as Kaleeba puts it, adding, ""I wish this blossom could be turned into a flower garden.""

It was Sikhangele Ndiweni's mother who launched IGAC's first attempt to raise money: a communal garden for cultivating and selling vegetables. But the plot was small, so the earnings were, too. Ndiweni's mother never saw IGAC's subsequent ventures; AIDS killed her in March of 1997, and her husband died three months later. As their oldest child, Ndiweni dropped out of school to nurse them--""I had to wash my mother and greet the people who visited her,"" she says--and now, at 20 years old, she is raising her sister and four brothers. She depends on IGAC for food and school fees, but she is not merely taking. Like her mother, she is helping IGAC raise money.

In addition to her household chores, Ndiweni tends a herd of goats, part of a donation IGAC received from HelpAge, an organization that assists the elderly. The goats, split into small herds and looked after mainly by orphans, are one of IGAC's two main income-generating projects. The other is a grinding mill for maize. The profits get divided up and given to committees throughout the district, who then perform triage, deciding which families in their villages most need blankets, school fees, or emergency rations of food.

Margaret Nkomo, a member of one of IGAC's local committees, says that in her corner of Insiza there are 46 children who have lost at least one parent. About a third of those orphans have no means of support besides IGAC, yet the goats and grinding mill paid for only some of the children's primary school fees. Nkomo and other volunteers covered the rest by dipping into their own shallow pockets. But secondary school costs more, so some older orphans couldn't afford to go.

Ndiweni would love to finish secondary school--she liked it and was a good student. But there is no money, and she has been catapulted into adulthood. Now she has begun making home-care visits, helping others even as she is herself helped. ""I can't bring any food,"" she says, ""but I can cook and wash and help in those ways.""

Eliot Magunje, an activist in Harare, is not impressed. ""It's not home-based care, it's home-based neglect,"" he charges. Magunje is HIV-positive, and much of his anger springs from the harsh fact that drugs which could prolong his life are too expensive here. But he exposes the central weakness of virtually every home-based care program in Africa: They offer little or no medical treatment. The ointment for Wilson's bedsores was an exception. Usually, says Isaiah Ndlovu, ""Our medicine is to pray.""

The emotional toll keeps accumulating. Volunteer Moddie Nkomo cared for her sister's son until he died, cleaning him after his frequent diarrhea. Then there was the ""very difficult day"" last November when Nkomo ""was looking in on three people, and they had all died. Even today we buried another,"" a 35-year-old man. His wife had died last year, and Nkomo had cared for her, too.

Many AIDS workers believe that programs like IGAC cannot last, especially given the lack of government support. AIDS, after all, has slammed into a continent already battered by a terrible history. Driven off the most fertile land, which remains in the hands of mostly white farmers, rural Africans constantly face food shortages. Many men are forced to migrate between the cities where the jobs are, and the homesteads where their extended families live. This oscillation is psychological as well as geographical, because many Africans exist in a limbo between traditional cultures that cannot be resurrected and a Western materialism that can seem empty. A catastrophe on the scale of AIDS could disintegrate these fragile communities.

Yet in Insiza, the opposite is happening. AIDS is definitely straining the community--but that is precisely why many villagers are volunteering. Especially in rural areas, many AIDS volunteers ""are not committed to fighting the disease so much as nurturing their community,"" explains Sy of UNAIDS. ""Success or failure shouldn't necessarily be seen in the number of people dying but helping the community stay together.""

That's why foreign aid is so fraught. While poverty can be incapacitating, donors often impose their own priorities or undermine the spirit of self-reliance. IGAC is successful because the villagers have mobilized themselves.

Tall, upright Ezekiel Sibanda is the sobuku, or headman, of one of Insiza's villages, and he says IGAC has set a precedent. Women have banded together to weave grass mats and sell them, sharing the profit and giving a little to the needy. Another group is doing the same thing raising chickens, still another has started a garden, and a youth group is making bricks. Such communal endeavors didn't exist before IGAC, Sibanda says. ""People were not as giving. IGAC has brought us together.""

And it has done so in a manner that harks back to ""what our traditional communities used to be,"" says Marowa of the national AIDS program. Precolonial African civilizations were often organized in smaller, more communitarian units than European nation-states. ""Indeed, the most distinctively African contribution to human history,"" writes John Reader in his highly acclaimed book, Africa: A Biography of the Continent, ""has been precisely the civilized art of living fairly peaceably together not in states."" As Kaleeba explains, ""While the state exists, the primary responsibility lies within my family, neighbors, and community. No one has written that law, but it is passed on and understood.""

Traditional African societies tended to be flexible networks where individual gain at the expense of the community was taboo--virtually the opposite of capitalism. This was no utopia, but rather an adaptation to Africa's harsh realities. The continent has always been underpopulated, so communities needed every able body, and needed them to give to the larger society. Africa's communal civilizations, Reader maintains, evolved to ensure ""survival in a hostile environment of impoverished soils, fickle climate, hordes of pests, and a more numerous variety of disease-bearing parasites than anywhere else on earth.""

IGAC's response to AIDS, then, is a reclamation of the age-old ways that enabled African communities to withstand previous scourges. The selflessness of the volunteers springs from deeply ingrained roles that were weakened but not broken by colonialism. The money-making projects are adaptations of those traditions to the present crisis, as is the frank talk about sex in IGAC's new youth program, which hands out condoms and warns girls away from ""sugar daddies.""

Still, poverty shadows these people too closely to consider IGAC's future secure. Many of the organization's goats, for example, died in an epidemic of their own; IGAC, of course, couldn't afford medicine to treat them. Another drought could finish off the herd, wither the communal gardens, and sap the community's spirit. And, of course, there is the relentless tide of AIDS.

Isaiah Ndlovu is walking with his volunteers on their way to visit another stricken family. Do the endless deaths make him frustrated or angry? ""No,"" he says, ""not at all. We have accepted it and when you accept it, it becomes ordinary life. Okay, death is here. But let's care for the sick and the orphans. To me it's just that simple.""

Huddled in blankets in her hut, Tabeth Nkomo knows she and her husband are both dying, knows her aged mother is already too feeble to till the fields, and knows that her four children will soon be orphans. ""I'm afraid for my last-born,"" she says. ""He's too small to fetch water and firewood."" So the biggest comfort that IGAC gives her is not bringing food or washing her frail body but the way they look after her children, cooking for them and disciplining them when they go astray. ""They help when I'm alive,"" she says, ""so I trust they will still help them when I go."""
46,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"Primatologist Caroline Tutin was boarding a flight from her home in Africa when a baby in toddler clothes and sunbonnet caught her eye. Then she did a ""horrendous double-take."" The baby was a chimpanzee. The animal's French owners, who lived in equatorial Gabon, were childless and they treated the animal as their baby, even giving it its own room, decorated like a little girl's.

About 10 years ago, Amandine, as they had named the chimp, became ill. Its owners--who insisted on being called its parents--took the animal to Gabon's Centre International de Recherches Medicales, Franceville (CIRMF), a world-class primate center. The scientists never discovered what was ailing the ape, but they did find another connection to human beings besides Amandine's wardrobe and the more than 98 percent of DNA that chimps and people have in common. Amandine was the first chimpanzee found to be infected with SIV, the simian equivalent of HIV.

Because of the genetic similarity between the chimp and human viruses, it appeared that HIV had originated in chimpanzees--a theory all but confirmed in February of this year by University of Alabama researcher Beatrice Hahn, who appears to have identified the exact chimpanzee subspecies--Pan troglodytes troglodytes--that harbors HIV's mother virus.

This finding is no mere historical anomaly. There is strong evidence that the virus has jumped from animals to humans on at least seven occasions. Unfortunately, the way this critically important science has been reported is undermining its credibility in Africa, the very place where most new variants of HIV are arising.

When Hahn presented her findings to about 5000 AIDS researchers in Chicago, she emphasized how the virus could have passed from apes to humans through the hunting and butchering of chimpanzees--a common practice that has provided protein for rainforest Africans over many centuries. But the hunting of ""bush meat"" has become commercialized, pushing the apes toward extinction. To emphasize her point, Hahn showed slides of slaughtered chimps. The normally staid scientific audience groaned in disgust, and it wasn't long before eating chimps was compared to cannibalism in The New York Times Magazine.

To many Africans, this was one more sign that nothing about Western thinking could be trusted, including science. Based on the media reports, many Africans dismissed the research as just another tool to denigrate their culture. ""In France you eat frogs and oysters, which to us is very strange,"" says Léopold Zekeng, director of Cameroon's national HIV research program. Eating monkeys and apes, he says, ""is part of our culture."" Portraying it as barbaric could backfire, Zekeng warns: ""Politicians could close up and say, 'We don't want you to do research because you might come out with findings that lead to more discrimination.' ""

In fact, research into the origin of AIDS could help save Africans and everyone else, because the virus is still emerging: still mutating and moving from apes and monkeys into humans.

Zekeng vividly remembers the 26-year-old patient he calls Miss A. In 1991, she came to his lab in Cameroon's capital, Yaoundé, with ""all the symptoms of AIDS--diarrhea, fever, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes. I was 200 percent sure she would test HIV-positive."" But she didn't. Zekeng took her blood to a sophisticated German lab and discovered that the woman was infected with a new, previously undocumented variant of HIV called Group O. It is so genetically distinct that scientists believe it didn't evolve from the main strains of HIV, but represents a separate transmission from chimps to humans. Eighteen months after Miss A came to Zekeng's office, the virus had killed her.

Just last year, another team of researchers found a variant of HIV, Group N, that is more closely related to the chimp virus than any yet found in humans. As with Group O, scientists say it entered humans through its own cross-species transmission. And it, too, eluded conventional blood tests.

""I still see patients with the clinical symptoms of AIDS, yet they turn out HIV-negative using all assays,"" says Zekeng.

""The AIDS viruses are not over,"" agrees Preston A. Marx, another expert in the evolution of HIV, who works at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center. ""We have the potential for more to come. It's possible we could develop an AIDS vaccine and have viruses that the vaccine doesn't work against. This isn't science fiction. New viruses are still emerging, viruses that can cause AIDS.""

In the mild rainforest evening, along a red-dirt logging road in southern Cameroon, the palm wine flows freely as a group of villagers talk around an open fire. The men all hunt, taking whatever the forest yields, from the small antelope called duikers to the great apes. ""Our parents were hunters, and their parents,"" says Gerard Ampoh Mentsilé.

But hunting has changed. In addition to spears and snares, the hunters now use guns, some homemade from truck axles. Bullets are expensive, so they get them from poachers who sell the bush meat in cities. Sometimes bullets constitute the hunters' only payment. When they get paid in cash, they use themoney to buy soap or fuel for their gas lanterns. No one here has electricity.

They also lack basic hygienic protection such as gloves. When animals are butchered and dressed, blood spatters on the hunters' skin. Scientists speculate that the virus could pass into them through cuts or sores. But the hunters drinking palm wine are not convinced. ""We've been eating chimps and monkeys for years and years, and never had anyone get sick from AIDS,"" says Lazare Ampomadjimi. ""So it can't be true.""

Everywhere, people have theories on how AIDS began. ""The average Cameroonian will tell you it all started in L.A. with the gay community,"" says Zekeng, ""or they'll tell you it's a virus Americans produced for biological warfare."" In Senegal, Sara Sagne, the leader of a traditional healing cooperative, offers probably the most poetic theory. He believes that after diseased dogs urinate, a flame rises that chars the earth and leaves a foul stench. A person who smells the odor can get AIDS. But this is no more fanciful than University of California professor Peter Duesberg's idea that AIDS is not caused by HIV but by drug abuse, and even by the AIDS drug AZT.

In fact, the same methodology that helped scientists determine that the flu virus comes from pigs and ducks has convinced most of them that HIV comes from chimpanzees. Says Zekeng: ""When I look at the phylogenetic analysis""--a comparison of DNA that reveals how closely related organisms are--""there's no doubt about it."" The human and chimp AIDS viruses, he says, ""really cluster together.""

Another reason to believe that the virus originated in Africa is that the continent is home to a greater variety of HIV strains than anywhere else. An organism's greatest genetic diversity generally lies in its home region, since strains that leave the motherland represent only a fraction of the whole, just one or two lineages. Then, too, chimpanzees live in the Central African region where the first AIDS cases were found. Finally, chimps appear not to get sick from their strain of SIV, suggesting that they and their virus have co-evolved. (Hahn is trying to crack the mystery of why infected chimps stay healthy, which could lead to treatments for people.)

Yet, sensitive from centuries of white stereotypes, many Africans view the theory that HIV came from apes as just another smear against ""the dark continent."" Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi denounced the out-of-Africa theory as ""a new form of hate campaign,"" according to Laurie Garrett's book The Coming Plague. Earlier this year, Zekeng refused to have his picture taken by a New York daily because ""I could see their front page covered with monkeys."" He has another fear: ""journalists who point their camera and say, 'These black Africans are the ones who originated HIV.' Now, let's imagine you and I are neighbors--what will be your reaction after seeing that show? If my child comes over to play with yours? How will you treat him? It feeds into racism.""

Many ordinary Africans point out that the disease was first found in white gay men half a world away, so how could Africa be the source? But given the long lag between HIV infection and disease, the ease of international travel, and the industrialized world's medical surveillance system, it is perfectly plausible that HIV could have first come to attention far from its source. Edward Mbidde, a leading Ugandan AIDS researcher, says flatly, ""It's not bigoted to say the virus originated in Africa.""

Yet the way the theory gets communicated can be shockingly racist. Peter Piot, now director of the United Nations AIDS program, UNAIDS, remembers the first world AIDS conference in 1985. There were only three African scientists, all from French-speaking Zaire, and Piot was their translator. The theory that HIV had emerged from simians was announced at the conference, and an American reporter rushed up to the African scientists, asking, ""Is it true that Africans have sex with monkeys?"" Piot gleefully translated the answer: ""No, but I have heard that Americans have sex with dogs.""

Today, it is the insinuation of cannibalism that contaminates the science. In the most recent media flurry on HIV's origin, a major player was Swiss photographer and eco-activist Karl Ammann. Eleven years ago Ammann bought a baby chimp from a hunter who had killed its mother. Childless, Ammann says the chimp aroused his ""fathering instinct,"" and today the animal sleeps together with him and his wife. A former hotel marketing director, Ammann has been trying to spotlight how the bush-meat business is wiping out the great apes. Then he heard about Hahn's research. Sensing a golden opportunity, he provided her with his deliberately shocking photographs that would make her audience groan with disgust.

In his home in Kenya--a 15-acre estate staffed by black servants--Ammann all but blames Africans for spawning AIDS. Explaining his media strategy, he says, ""The average Westerner hears so much about Africa's problems, they're sick and tired of it: 'So a bunch of Africans eat a bunch of monkeys, why should I care?' But if that particular practice has brought him AIDS, he has to now change his lifestyle. Because of the lifestyle in Africa of people eating monkeys he has to now wear a condom.""

Cameroonian scientist Judith Torimiro was studying at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine when Hahn's research hit the news, and she remembers a discussion among her fellow students. ""They were talking about possible transmission when hunters butcher the meat, but then someone asked, 'What about eating?' And the next question was, 'Do they cook the meat?' 'Yes, of course,' I said. 'And I eat it. My mother used to make it.' "" She pauses and, in an anguished voice, adds, ""How could they ask if we cook the meat?""

The Italians eat carpaccio and the Japanese sushi, so the question was not necessarily racist. But given the continent's history, the question raises African suspicions. Those turn to hackles when Ammann makes statements such as ""The colonial powers and the missionaries had managed to wipe out cannibalism. When do we start on 98.4 percent cannibalism?""

Such inflammatory rhetoric discredits AIDS science in the minds of many Africans. After all, if whites think eating animals is cannibalism and that Africans have sex with monkeys, how can anything they say be true?

Roy Mugerwa is the principal investigator of Africa's first AIDS vaccine trial. Even though the vaccine had already been tried in Europe and America, Mugerwa had to push for more than three years to launch the trial, and even had to appear before Parliament. He recalls that a common argument was: ""White people say AIDS originated here, and now they're bringing this vaccine, which could make it worse."" As the AIDS-vaccine debate was unfolding, the government announced an effort to eradicate polio from Uganda. In the cauldron of suspicion and fear, a radio broadcaster announced that the polio vaccine might be contaminated with live HIV. As a result, thousands of children were not vaccinated, leaving them vulnerable to being crippled. ""Why,"" Mugerwa asks, ""does the false tend to be more easily believed than the true?""

No one knows how often aids viruses leap the species barrier, but when they do, what often transpires is what happened to Subject 11008, as she is known in the scientific literature. A 52-year-old woman living in Sierra Leone who eked out a living by farming, Subject 11008 was one of 9300 people whom Marx screened for a virus called HIV-2.

A little-known fact is that there are two separate AIDS epidemics. The major one--which has killed more than 16 million people, according to figures released this week--is caused by HIV-1. But there is another AIDS epidemic, much smaller and concentrated in West Africa, caused by HIV-2, a less virulent and less transmissible virus that, nonetheless, can kill. While HIV-1 almost certainly comes from chimpanzees, HIV-2 comes from the sooty mangabey monkey.

Subject 11008 tested positive for antibodies to HIV-2. But when Marx examined her virus, he found that it was quite distinct from any other known HIV-2, though still clearly within the family. It was what virologists call a different ""subtype"" or ""clade,"" from the Greek for ""branch."" A ""strain"" generally indicates a small variation in the genetic code of viruses--an HIV-positive person usually has several strains in his or her body--but a subtype or clade is genetically much different. Scientists have identified 11 subtypes in the main group of HIV-1 and six subtypes of HIV-2. Subject 11008's virus was labeled subtype F. To this day, it has never been found in any other person.

What's more, subtype F is so genetically distinct that it very likely did not evolve from one of the common subtypes but crossed into humans, quite possibly into Subject 11008, who said she ate sooty mangabeys. ""It's an example of a crossover virus that didn't get the help that it needs to become an epidemic,"" says Marx.

The origin of a virus and the origin of an epidemic are different. The first is purely biological; the other is both biological and social.

Viruses are parasites; they replicate only by hijacking the machinery of cells. So a virus that jumps species must must be able to operate in cells that are biologically different from those of its original host. If it can't replicate efficiently, it won't be able to spread from one person to another.

Many viruses can't. Hahn and renowned AIDS researcher David Ho studied another person infected with a unique subtype of HIV-2. That patient never exhibited symptoms; in fact, researchers were only able to extract fragments of the virus, footprints of its failed attempt to survive in humans.

But even if a virus can replicate efficiently, it might not spark an epidemic. In 1976, a Norwegian sailor who had been in West Africa died of a mysterious disease. His wife and one of his three children also succumbed, both with shattered immune systems. ""Now, the Norwegians are very well organized,"" says Francois Simon, a French researcher who studies HIV's diver-sity, ""so they kept tissue samples."" Those samples tested positive for HIV-1; the Norwegian sailor is Europe's first known case of AIDS.

Yet despite the fact that his virus was obviously capable of spreading, it died with his wife and child. The viral subtypes that have terrorized the world are genetically very different from the sailor's virus. And yet his HIV was the same very rare variant that turned up more than a quarter century later in Zekeng's 26-year-old Cameroonian woman: Group O. In other words, it was a tiny, sputtering epidemic all its own. In parts of Cameroon, it now accounts for 5 percent of all HIV-1 infections.

AIDS viruses have probably existed in many different animals for thousands of years, perhaps longer. Cows have been found with bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), while feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infects house cats, lions, cheetahs, and North American pumas. Many species of monkeys have now been found carrying SIV. (The fact that the virus is in so many simian species strongly suggests that it has circulated among them for a long time, whereas HIV only entered large human populations in the 1970s. That's one reason scientists are convinced the virus went from simians to humans, and not the other way around.) ""The reservoir"" of animal AIDS viruses, says Simon, ""is unlimited.""

So if such a vast ocean of immunodeficiency viruses has long existed, why did an epidemic happen only now? Why not during the slave trade, when millions of Africans were taken from the areas where both HIV-1 and HIV-2 originated? Here was a massive mixing of peoples, and the slaves were often raped, giving the virus ample opportunity to spread. And yet, no epidemic flared up--or if one did, it was small, flickering out like the virus in the Norwegian sailor's family. On the other hand, two major AIDS epidemics--not to mention the micro-epidemic of Group O--have arisen in the past 70 years. This is what obsesses Marx: ""Something that has to do with the 20th century has changed the ecology between SIV and HIV and has allowed these epidemics to occur. And we don't understand what that is.""

A new book, The River by Edward Hooper, argues that the oral polio vaccine introduced SIV into humans, because some batches of the vaccine may have been grown in the kidneys of SIV-infected chimpanzees. ""Plausible but improbable,"" says Ho. The chimps in that area are the wrong subspecies, and Los Alamos National Laboratory researcher Bette Korber will soon release findings that HIV very likely evolved into its modern form decades before the polio vaccine was invented. (Still, the remaining stock of the vaccine batches Hooper implicates will soon be tested.)

A more plausible idea is that blood transfusions and hypodermic needles--which were often reused in Africa without being sterilized--boosted the evolution and spread of emerging HIVs, by giving these viruses more chances to adapt to human biology. And, of course, once the viruses had adapted, needles would help them spread, as they have among IV drug users throughout America.

But needles and transfusions probably aren't the whole story. After all, traditional African healers reuse blades to make medicinal incisions in their patients, and elders reuse knives for ritual scarification. What allowed a crossover virus to explode into an epidemic is almost certainly the cultural upheaval that has shaken Africa. Cameroon, a country smaller than Spain, has more than 200 indigenous languages. After World War I, colonial rule imposed just two national languages--English and French--permitting people who would never have intermarried, or even interacted, to do so. Roads, railways, and air travel allowed people to move and mingle more easily than ever before. And urbanization gathered huge numbers of people in one place, where poverty and the breakdown of traditional cultures led to industrial-scale prostitution. Early in the epidemic, it was noted that HIV cases clustered in the towns along Africa's trucking routes, because truck drivers frequented prostitutes.

Marx wants to understand as much as he can about the emergence of HIV, biologically and socially, in hopes of preventing the emergence of new viruses. Indeed, new microbes have already arisen. ""Hepatitis C, there's no good explanation for the emergence of that virus,"" Marx says. ""Where'd it come from?""

Where did viruses come from, period? HIV is a retrovirus, which copies its genetic code onto the DNA of its host. So perhaps, says Robert Gallo, co-discoverer of HIV, the virus started out as a kind of genetic messenger, transporting key segments of DNA among life's early organisms. ""Did viruses play a role in evolution, perhaps a role in speciation or in embryonic life? Or did they start out as junk DNA with no purpose? What the fuck was their role? We don't know.""

While HIV's history is fascinating, THE more urgent question concerns its future. The Hollywood scenario is that a deadlier or more transmissible AIDS ""supervirus"" might arise. ""Unlikely,"" says Simon. Many scientists believe that it is in the best interest of a virus not to kill its host, so the virus may evolve into more benign strains. But it's also in the best interest of the virus to become more transmissible, in which case it doesn't matter if the virus kills its host because it will live on by spreading into new patients. Still, Simon had to screen many thousands of blood samples to find just five cases of the newest HIV-1 variant, Group N. Clearly, new crossover viruses are rare.

But they do occur, and even if they are not more virulent, they still pose problems. For one thing, they might escape detection on tests and so pass into the blood supply. They also might be able to evade drugs or a vaccine. Already, Simon and colleagues found that one HIV variant, subtype G, is resistant to at least two of the powerful protease inhibitors that have given patients in the West a new lease on life. Indeed, a ""signature"" of this subtype is a mutation which renders the drugs less effective.

HIV is amazingly protean, averaging one alteration of its genetic code every time it infects a new cell, which it does millions of times each day in each patient. The math is dizzying. With tens of millions of people infected globally, HIV is probably changing every letter in its genetic code many times every day.

But HIV can leap ahead of even its swift pace of mutation by ""recombination."" If a person gets infected with two separate strains, then through a kind of viral sex those strains can mix their genetic material to form a hybrid strain. Through recombination, a virus can instantly and radically transform itself. Several of HIV's subtypes were formed through this process.

That's a reason to study the origin of HIV. Some researchers envision a science of emerging microbes that could short-circuit viral evolution and protect humans. But for the moment, recombination is a reason to worry about new types of HIV entering human beings: the greater the variety of strains, the greater the chance that they will reshuffle their parts into a more dangerous subtype. ""There is genetic engineering going on in nature,"" says Piot of UNAIDS. ""The virus is experimenting with itself.""

""The most striking case I have seen in the last six months,"" says Zekeng, ""was a 45-year-old man sent to me from the TB unit. He had chest problems but not TB. He had lost weight. He had KS""--an HIV-related cancer--""on his ankle. And he had a persistent fever."" In short, a classic AIDS case. ""Yet he--repeatedly--tested negative on at least six different screening tests."" Twice, Zekeng has sent this man's blood to a state-of-the-art laboratory in Germany, but no virus has been detected. ""Is it going to be HIV-3?"" asks Zekeng. ""I don't know."""
47,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"Sipewe Mhakeni used herbs from the Mugugudhu tree. After grinding the stem and leaf, she would mix just a pinch of the sand-colored powder with water, wrap it in a bit of nylon stocking, and insert it into her vagina for 10 to 15 minutes. The herbs swell the soft tissues of the vagina, make it hot, and dry it out. That made sex ""very painful,"" says Mhakeni. But, she adds, ""Our African husbands enjoy sex with a dry vagina.""

Many women concur that dry sex, as this practice is called, hurts. Yet it is common throughout southern Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is worse than anywhere in the world. Researchers conducting a study in Zimbabwe, where Mhakeni lives, had trouble finding a control group of women who did not engage in some form of the practice. Some women dry out their vaginas withmutendo wegudo--soil with baboon urine--that they obtain from traditional healers, while others use detergents, salt, cotton, or shredded newspaper. Research shows that dry sex causes vaginal lacerations and suppresses the vagina's natural bacteria, both of which increase the likelihood of HIV infection. And some AIDS workers believe the extra friction makes condoms tear more easily.

Dry sex is not the only way African women subordinate their sexual safety to men's pleasure. In a few cultures, a woman's vagina is kept tight by sewing it almost shut. But in most African societies, the methods are subtler: Girls are socialized to yield sexual decision-making to men. Prisca Mhlolo is in charge of counseling at The Centre, a large organization for HIV-positive Zimbabweans. ""You're not even allowed to say, 'Can we have sex?' "" she notes. ""So it's very hard to bring up condoms.""

Mhlolo speaks from both professional and personal experience. She is HIV-positive, infected by her late husband. As AIDS eroded his immune system, he suffered from herpes, which broke into open sores on his penis. Mhlolo suggested condoms, ""but he said, 'Now that I'm sick you have gotten yourself a boyfriend.' It was very hard.""

Many people balk at discussing the sexual practices of particular cultures because the issue is too sensitive--and, in Africa, too racially charged. Whites have caricatured African sexuality for centuries, casting black men as sexual beasts, and some whites still whisper that this is why HIV is running rampant among Africans. But such stereotypes miss the point, which is not the libido itself but the culture in which it finds expression. HIV spread through the American gay community because having anal sex with many partners was common, and the virus infiltrated the Thai army because soldiers routinely patronized prostitutes. In Bombay, where AIDS has exploded, slum lords demand payment in sex. I.V. drug use aside, male sexual privilege is what drives the epidemic.

Studies from many different cultures show that men average more partners than women do and have more sex outside marriage. Because a man ejaculates into a woman, men are more likely to transmit the virus, whereas women are more likely to contract HIV without passing it on. So far, males have outnumbered females in HIV cases, partly because having more partners means more chances to encounter the virus. But new figures show that in sub-Saharan Africa, 55 percent of all infected adults are women.

Of course, Africa contains thousands of cultures, some of which have strict sexual codes. But common to many sub-Saharan societies are the gender roles epitomized by dry sex: Women are unable to negotiate sex, and so must risk infection to please the man. In fact, there are very few female checks and balances on male behavior. This stark inequality ""is part of our culture,"" Mhlolo says, ""and our culture is part of why HIV is spreading.""

Africa today is far removed from its traditional, tightly knit communities that did constrain men, mostly to their wives. Africa is also very different from the West, where women exercise a relatively large degree of power. Many parts of contemporary Africa are suspended in a limbo that combines the worst of both worlds, and HIV has exploited this. For example, men retain the mindset of polygamy, but now have many partners through commercial sex or ""sugar daddy"" relationships that lack the social cohesion of traditional marriages.

But AIDS is forcing African culture to change--and because the virus in Africa is spread mainly through heterosexual sex, the epidemic's largest social transformation may well be in the relations between women and men. Women could emerge from the epidemic with more power, and there is a strong push to make that happen. But there is also a backlash, a call to reimpose restrictions on women in the name of strengthening traditional African cultures and curtailing AIDS.

The battles are being fought not only over sexual practices, but also over larger economic and social forces that subordinate women and facilitate the spread of HIV. The World Bank reports that illiteracy rates among women south of the Sahara are almost 50 percent higher than among men. Many African girls cannot attend school because they are assigned time-consuming chores such as fetching water and firewood. Indeed, African women work longer than men--and harder. Studies from Ghana and Tanzania show that rural women transport four times as much as men, often carrying the loads on their head, and other studies show that women do up to 90 percent of hoeing and weeding. Yet they make far less money than men and rarely own property. In Cameroon, for example, fewer than 10 percent of all land certificates belong to women.

African women also lack authority. Just this year, Zimbabwe's Supreme Court ruled that women have no more status or rights in the family than a ""junior male""--usually an adolescent. If a wife wants to take a trip, explains Thoko Matshe, director of the Women's Resource Center in the capital Harare, ""she has to sit her husband down, get the guy in a good mood, and ask him if she can go. If you cannot negotiate that, you cannot negotiate sex.""

In most sub-Saharan traditional cultures, men pay for their wives, which gives them license to dominate the relationship. The very concept of marital rape doesn't exist in most of Africa, and even the aunties--traditional marriage counselors for many young African wives--tell women that they cannot refuse sex with their husbands. Thoko Ngwenya of Zimbabwe's Musasa Project, which fights domestic violence, explains the mindset: ""Once a man has paid lobola""--the word for dowry in several southern African languages--""they are not forcing their wife to have sex. It's just their right.""

The sexual subservience of women is inculcated long before adulthood. For example, traditional Shona girls are taught to pull the lips of their labia to lengthen them so that men can play with them during foreplay, yet women are not supposed to touch their husband's penis. Indeed, in some cultures, female circumcision removes the most sexually sensitive part of a woman's body--her clitoris. ""For women,"" says Caroline Maposhere of Zimbabwe's Women and AIDS Support Network, ""there is no sexuality, only fertility.""

Ironically, the prohibition against wives participating fully and actively in sex can itself promote the spread of the virus. Eliot Ma-gunje runs counseling groups for men at The Centre. He hears men complain that their wives' passivity ""destroys the enjoyment of sex--she's just lying there like a log. 'Why are we going out?' men ask. 'Because a prostitute is 100 percent what I want. My wife is just for cooking and washing.' ""

Of course, real-life relations between men and women are more complex. Jane, a Zimbabwean woman who asked that her last name not be used, says, ""If your husband demands sex you are not allowed to deny him, but in practice you communicate and understand each other."" The trouble is that such communication takes place on a field steeply tilted in favor of the man. Jane, for example, knew that her husband had a girlfriend on the side, and she took the step of asking him to use a condom. ""My husband answered, 'I cannot use a condom with my wife,' "" Jane recalls. ""So I think that's why I got infected."" She's not alone. A study from Zimbabwe found that more than half of women with STDs contracted their illnesses from their husbands. Marriage, say many AIDS workers, is a risk factor.

Anecdotal reports indicate that dry sex is waning among educated, urban young people. But there are also loud calls to reject Western gender roles, which are said to emasculate men. Even in the cities, says Matshe, ""it's 50-50."" Of course, most Africans still live in rural areas or small towns. And changing sexual practices is never easy, in part because they touch fundamental issues of personal identity and sexual roles.

It's not surprising that men like dry sex--the swollen tissues make the vagina smaller and, therefore, make the man feel bigger. Also, some men (and women) find vaginal secretions repugnant, while others don't like the sound of wet sex. And to many men, a vagina that is too wet and loose can signify infidelity.

But some women also prefer dry sex. Mhakeni stopped only because she is HIV-positive and wants to protect herself against getting any sexually transmitted diseases that might weaken her immune system. Despite the pain of dry sex, she favors it. ""It's our culture,"" she explains. Then she adds a reason researchers and AIDS workers say they hear over and over again: ""If I don't use herbs, our men will go with someone else."" Indeed, Mhakeni sells the herbs, and even when she warns women of the risks, they still buy. ""They say, 'It is okay if HIV is brought in by my husband, because at least I will still be married.' ""

Fanuel Adala Otuko looks every inch the leader of Kenya's Luo people: old, ramrod straight, missing six lower teeth pulled at age 12 as a rite of passage. ""It is painful,"" he says, ""but you cannot cry.""

The Luos no longer pull their children's teeth, but Otuko and other elders want to revive some of the Luo's other traditions, especially those they believe might slow the spread of HIV, which has devastated them. In Kenya, Luo land is one of the hardest-hit areas in the country, with the rate of infection among adults in Kisumu, the city where Otuko lives, topping 20 percent.

All over Africa, AIDS workers are beginning to target male behavior. Around Kisumu, they are especially concerned about the fish merchants on the shores of Lake Victoria, who lure young girls with money. But Otuko and other Luo elders focus on women.

For example, the elders want to revive the ideal of female virginity. Traditionally, on the afternoon of a wedding, a dozen or more married women went to the newlyweds' home to check for blood, believed to be a sign of a woman's virginity. They also checked the man--not for virginity, but for sexual prowess. They ""witness that she has a normal man,"" explains Otuko, ""a man who can have sexual relations with her.""

The elders also want to take more aggressive steps. Against the recommendations of most public-health workers, they want to identify HIV-positive women and impose restrictions on them. ""They should be controlled, quarantined in their areas,"" Otuko says. (Only when asked does he say that this restriction could also apply to men.) ""AIDS is serious,"" he says. ""There is no cure. So people should avoid contact with infected women, sexual contact especially."" There's the rub, because one venerated Luo tradition usually involves sex with a widow--and AIDS has caused a proliferation of widows.

Like many cultures in East and southern Africa, the Luo practice what is variously translated as home guardianship or, more commonly, widow inheritance. When a husband dies, one of his brothers or cousins marries the widow. This tradition guaranteed that the children would remain in the late husband's clan--after all, they had paid a dowry for the woman--and it also ensured that the widow and her children were provided for. When the guardian takes the widow, sexual intercourse is believed to ""cleanse"" her of the devils of death. A woman who refuses to take a guardian brings down chira--ill fortune--on the entire clan. Of course, if her husband died of AIDS, she might very well pass on the virus to her guardian. Millicent Obaso, a Luo public-health worker with the Red Cross, says: ""We have homes where all the males have died because of this widow inheritance.""

Danger to the inheritors is only one reason AIDS is putting this tradition under strain. Guardians are supposed to provide assistance, but even the elders concede that inheritors often take a widow only for sexual pleasure or to seize her property. According to tradition, a guardian must already have a wife of his own, so no matter how well-intentioned he may be, poverty often makes it impossible to support a second family.

Anna Adhiambo is standing where she and her husband used to live: in Ngeri village, on a fertile hillside that slopes down into the blue expanse of Lake Victoria. It's the first time she has been back since her late husband's family forced her off the property two years ago. Her husband died of AIDS in 1996, and she was inherited by his cousin. She expected him to help her feed her three children and pay their school fees (education in Kenya, as in most African countries, is not free). But he was a fisherman who had a family of his own, and ""whenever he came from the lake,"" Anna recalls, ""he said he didn't have enough. That was the song."" They quarreled frequently, and five months after she was inherited, Anna decided to separate.

The consequences were swift and harsh. A group of men from the clan told her she and her children would have to leave the next day. She remembers that they called her an ochot, a whore who ""goes from one man to another."" When she asked them to ""please leave me alone in my house,"" she recalls one of her brothers-in-law retorting, ""This is our home. You shouldn't answer me rudely like that, and if you do so again, I will beat you.""

Consolata Atieno is Anna's mother-in-law. She has been smoothing the earthen walls of a new hut, and on her hands the thick mud dries and cracks as she talks. Anna ""violated tradition, broke a taboo,"" she says, so ""we had to chase her and her children away. We felt the furniture and things in the house were my son's, so we took them. Anna did not buy them. And the land we took: Some we gave to my other sons, some we sold. In our tradition, a woman is the property of her husband's family. He bought her with the dowry.""

Unable to farm, Anna now makes less than $10 a month doing odd jobs in a nearby town. The Akado Women's Group, a local agency, is assisting her, but so far only one of her three children is in school. How does Atieno feel about her grandchildren suffering? ""When Anna was making this decision, she must have known the consequences."" But if Anna cannot provide for them, her children will be at greater risk for continuing the cycle of infection. A study in Zambia, for example, found that a lack of education quadrupled the chances that a woman would contract HIV.

Otuko and the elders believe home guardianship could strengthen families like Anna's. What the elders want is to strip this tradition of its sexual component, transforming it into what they call ""symbolic inheritance."" They point out that nonsexual cleansing was practiced with aged widows who were past menopause. And in parts of Zambia and Zimbabwe, such symbolic rites have gained ground.

University of Nairobi philosophy professor Oriare Nyarwath believes nonsexual inheritance could bring ""a dignified death to the practice, without making people feel culturally destitute."" But, he notes, even symbolic guardianship implies that women are subservient to and dependent upon men. ""The culture is patrilineal and patriarchal,"" he says. ""The woman goes to live in the man's home, the woman fits within the man's culture. So necessarily she's not on the same footing as the man.""

The most pernicious inequality is poverty, by no means a uniquely African phenomenon. Of the world's 1.3 billion living in abject poverty, 70 percent are women--and most of them face the same basic problems as African women. ""In pre-industrial societies women are trapped in their reproductive roles,"" says Geeta Rao Gupta, president of the International Center for Research on Women. In ICRW's numerous studies on HIV, women from Latin America, Asia, and Africa report that they dare not insist on safer sex--or object to painful sex--for fear of being abandoned by their men and spiraling down into destitution. No wonder that in a 19-country study, ICRW found that the lower women's status, the higher HIV.

There are few places where poverty is worse than in Nairobi's slums, vast warrens of tin shanties, open sewers, and garbage-strewn dirt roads. In Korogocho, one of the poorest and meanest sections, a maze of narrow passageways leads into a one-room shack where the aroma of vegetable stew simmering on an open fire competes with the stench of raw sewage wafting in from outside. This is the home of Mary, who asked that her last name not be used. Two babies--Mary's seventh child and her first grandchild--lie on the bed.

Just a week ago, one of Mary's johns--who pay as little as 75 cents for sex--slapped her in the face when she asked him to use a condom. ""I can't eat a sweet in its wrapper,"" he said. Flashing back eight years to the man who beat her so viciously that she couldn't work for two days, she let her latest violent customer go ahead. He may pay for his pleasure with AIDS, because Mary is HIV-positive.

Mary wasn't born in the slums, but in a rural area 100 kilometers outside of Nairobi. There, rich red earth nourishes broad green leaves of the plantain tree, the billowing shrubbery of coffee plants, and the yellow-tufted stalks of maize. Mary's mother Beth sits in a hut, the door propped open with a machete, and explains why her daughter left. Her account corresponds exactly to the one given independently by her daughter. The tale they tell is an allegory of how women's powerlessness fuels the AIDS epidemic.

Mary's husband ""was a drunkard,"" Beth says. He beat Mary virtually every week, burned her clothes, and denied her food. Once, when he was drubbing Mary, one of their children got in the way. The husband literally threw the seven-year-old girl aside. She landed on a rock, injured her lung, and was hospitalized for two weeks. Mary fled to her parents.

At first Mary's father, who died just this year, welcomed her home. But after a few days he realized that Mary and her children were extra mouths to feed. Mary recalls, ""My father told me 'I have my own kids, so you're a burden to me. Pack up and go.' ""

There are thousands of women like Mary in Nairobi, not to mention all of Africa, and to help curb the spread of HIV they need much more than AIDS awareness. ""The women I work with say they'd rather die of AIDS tomorrow than die of hunger today,"" says Ann Waweru, director of the Voluntary Women's Rehabilitation Centre, an organization that helps sex workers, including Mary, find alternative work. It's not easy. ""Most have no skills and no place to get a loan to start a business. A man is almost never burdened with children, so he can do casual work, earn 20 shillings, and survive on that. But most of the women we work with have children. They are driven to commercial sex by poverty.""

According to the custom of the Kikuyu people, Mary's brothers were each given a plot of land to farm. But as a female child Mary was given nothing. At first, she tried to stay in the village, supporting herself and her children by doing odd jobs such as drawing water from the well and helping people till their fields. But her father wasn't satisfied and he would beat Mary and her mother. After six months Mary fled for Nairobi with her children and virtually nothing else.

In the city, she spent her first night at the home of a friend, who told her, ""I'm going to show you how to get money."" Mary turned her first john that night, and, she recalls, ""I was happy because I got money to feed my children."""
48,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"In this city's Pumwani slum, everything seems inverted. Pumwani is one of the Kenyan capital's red-light districts, but the action happens during the day. After dark, it gets too dangerous even for prostitutes. Then there's the way the women advertise: no hip-high skirts or brazen busts. Instead, says Joshua Kimani, a charismatic young doctor who runs a research clinic for sex workers, a prostitute is ""whoever sits outside their doorway looking clean.""

But the most profound turnabout centers on women like Joyce, who lives in a room hardly big enough for her bed. Joyce, who asked that her real name not be used, came to Nairobi from Tanzania. With three children to feed, she turned to prostitution within a year. That was 1983.

No one knows exactly when HIV entered Nairobi. But in 1985, Canadian researcher Frank Plummer was studying gonorrhea and chlamydia among Pumwani sex workers, and almost as an afterthought he decided to add an HIV test. Two-thirds of the women tested positive. He shifted his focus to HIV.

Joyce was one of the lucky uninfected women--in fact, her luck was nothing short of astonishing. Fourteen years have passed since her original HIV test, and she has spent half those years servicing up to 10 johns a day. Yet she has remained HIV-negative even as the percentage of infected prostitutes topped 90 percent. She contracted other STDs, proving that her partners didn't use condoms and that she was almost certainly being exposed to HIV. But Joyce didn't get it.

Joyce was certainly unusual, but not unique. Indeed, Plummer made a curious discovery: If a sex worker didn't contract the virus after five years, she was unlikely ever to get it. The simplest explanation was that women like Joyce were resistant to HIV--almost uninfectable--and that's why these sex workers electrified the scientific community. They were, in the understated language of researchers, ""multiply exposed but uninfected.""

Prostitutes have been the scapegoats for AIDS in Africa, where the disease is spread mainly by heterosexual sex, and where men blame sex workers for bringing down AIDS. But, in the richest of ironies, Joyce and other prostitutes have provided researchers with valuable clues to the intricate workings of the immune system, and especially how it might be able to fend off the virus. In fact, the knowledge researchers gained from these women has been translated into a promising vaccine that is about to be tested in humans. The scapegoats of Africa's epidemic just might turn out to rank among its saviors.

Only a vaccine can end the AIDS epidemic.

The powerful new AIDS drugs, besides being too expensive for developing countries, do not cure the disease. In America and Europe, drug resistance and severe side effects are undermining the treatment of more and more patients, and the notion that HIV could be purged from the body has been shattered. The virus, which integrates into a patient's own DNA, appears to persist for life.

In theory, behavioral changes could stop the epidemic, and many Africans look to Uganda for hope. Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni aggressively confronted the epidemic, and infection rates in some urban areas have declined dramatically since the early 1990s; one surveillance site found that the prevalence of the virus has fallen by half. Yet even at that site, more than 13 percent of pregnant women are still infected--a huge pool of HIV-positive people. While education certainly can save millions, the fact is that behavioral change has never managed to halt the epidemic, not even in wealthy countries.

But vaccination has eradicated one disease--smallpox--and is on the verge of eliminating a second--polio. Ugandan researcher Roy Mugerwa, principal investigator of Africa's first AIDS vaccine trial, says, ""We have learned from history that the only way to halt epidemics is with a vaccine.""

Vaccines do not fight off infection; instead, they teach the immune system to recognize and attack the microbe. The world's first vaccine, for smallpox, was the cowpox virus, which causes only mild symptoms in people but primes the immune system for smallpox. Salk's polio vaccine was simply a killed polio virus. Technology has advanced, but the principle remains the same as when the ancient Chinese used to blow pulverized smallpox scabs through a bone into people's noses: Train the immune system with a dummy virus.

But can the body be taught to fight off HIV? There was a time when many scientists came close to despair, and many still harbor doubts. After all, AIDS attacks the immune system itself, and it kills almost everyone it infects. There were always people who recovered from smallpox, and there were many more who never even showed symptoms because they fought off the virus so quickly. But the more scientists learned about the natural history of AIDS, the more it seemed that everyone infected would succumb and that no one could repel the virus.

This is why the Pumwani prostitutes are so important. It's also why ""people didn't believe us in the beginning,"" recalls Omu Anzala, one of the researchers who studied the Pumwani women. Had the sex workers really come in contact with the virus? They certainly didn't test antibody-positive, the classic trace of an infection. So maybe, despite all their johns, they had never encountered the virus.

But the virus leaves other traces. The immune system has two main arms: antibodies, which attack viruses floating free in the bloodstream, and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes--or killer T-cells--which destroy the body's own cells that have been infected. Like antibodies, killer T-cells are specific to one microbe, so they, too, are a kind of fingerprint.

What happens is that an infected cell displays on its outer membrane fragments of the virus called epitopes. Killer T-cells that recognize these particular epitopes destroy the infected cell. What's more, the immune system clones millions of killer T-cells that are specific to those epitopes, in order to wipe out all the cells the virus has infected. So, high numbers of HIV-specific T-cells indicate that the virus was present.

Oxford researcher Andrew McMichael is one of the world's leading experts on the killer T-cell. McMichael and his colleague Sarah Rowland-Jones had studied multiply exposed yet uninfected sex workers in the West African nation of the Gambia, and many of them had elevated numbers of HIV-specific killer T-cells. But in the world of the multiply exposed, the Gambian sex workers couldn't hold a candle to the Pumwani prostitutes. They were the acid test.

Plummer's team had found evidence of HIV-specific killer T-cells, but many scientists weren't convinced. Collaborating with Plummer, the Oxford researchers verified the findings, banishing virtually all scientific doubt: The women really had been exposed to HIV, and their bodies had mounted a defense with killer T-cells.

Could those cells be the key to protection?

As scientists learned more about HIV's initial assault on the body, it became clear that the immune system always mounts a vigorous counterattack. In fact, what happens in the first few weeks after infection is nothing short of extraordinary--and it bolsters the current consensus that killer T-cells are critical to warding off HIV.

What typically happens is this: The surfaces of certain cells in the body are studded with two molecules, named CD4 and CCR5. If the virus chances upon such a cell and binds to these molecules, then, like a burglar picking a lock, HIV gains entry, commandeers the cell's DNA, and forces it to churn out as many as 10,000 new viruses. These are ejected from the cell to float in the body, waiting to enter new cells.

Within 48 hours, swarms of viruses have advanced from the site of infection into the lymph nodes, where HIV's favorite immune-system cells abound. In as little as three days, the virus has infiltrated certain long-lived cells where it can hide out during years of ferocious medical assault and still emerge to rekindle the infection. By the 10th day, HIV has usually spread to the brain, spleen, and gut. At this point in the invasion, the amount of HIV in the blood soars to almost unbelievable levels: A single milliliter of blood--a mere droplet--can be teeming with as many as 95 million viruses.

Then the immune system rallies. The body produces millions of HIV-specific killer T-cells that attack infected cells and also excrete special molecules that can paralyze HIV. Antibodies against the virus won't appear in the blood for about two more weeks--sometimes not for a few months--and they seem to have little effect. It is the killer T-cells that appear to suppress the virus.

Yet they don't eliminate it. Instead, the virus and the immune system become locked in a pitched battle that lasts for years. Eventually, for reasons that are still not understood, HIV overwhelms the immune system, rendering the patient vulnerable to whatever diseases come along.

Those initial days of infection, when the body becomes saturated with virus, are the key to a vaccine, McMichael believes. Killer T-cells are ""always chasing the virus,"" he says, ""and the virus is always one step ahead. But if a person is vaccinated, then the immune system starts out ahead.""

So what McMichael and his team have done is construct a vaccine made from the DNA of epitopes that killer T-cells recognize. He's made sure that these virus fragments come from parts of HIV that don't mutate and so can't change to escape the T-cells' attack. Some of the epitopes in the vaccine are ones targeted by killer T-cells of the exposed but uninfected Pumwani prostitutes. ""The vaccine,"" says Plummer, ""was built in part around these women.""

After safety trials in England starting early next year, the vaccine will go into trials in Nairobi. Maybe a vaccinated immune system can eliminate the virus before it gains a foothold. Or, barring that, maybe the vaccine could help the body suppress the virus to such low levels that it would be hard to transmit and never cause disease.

Maybe.

Selina, not her real name, blocks out the difficult parts of her life. She claims, for example, that she cannot recall the first time she had sex for money. But she revels in the scraps of good fortune that come her way, such as the fact that she never got HIV. Like Joyce, she had been in Plummer's original 1985 cohort, and like Joyce she didn't get infected. She bragged that she was immune. But today, when asked if she used to think she was invulnerable to the virus, she answers in a non sequitur, saying that she has to be careful because some men remove their condoms ""in a tricky way.""

The life of prostitutes in Pumwani is hard. When they contract HIV, they progress to full-blown AIDS in an average of just four years--far less time than Kenyan women who aren't sex workers, not to mention First World women. The prostitutes, says Plummer, live ""incredibly violent"" lives. In 1996, Selina was raped repeatedly. At that point she had tested HIV-negative for 11 years. But shortly after the rape, she tested positive. She has already suffered a variety of AIDS-related illnesses and lost more than 10 percent of her body weight. The veins on her forearms are prominent, running like long ridges down the smooth landscape of her skin. Yet Selina has staunchly refused to be told the results of her test. Kimani explains, ""She can't come to terms with the fact that she thought she couldn't get HIV and now she has.""

There are a few others like Selina--multiply exposed, persistently negative women who suddenly have become positive. Plummer and Kimani think that in Selina's case, the stress of the rape might have weakened her immune system. But the other women who have belatedly turned positive seem to have another risk factor: stopping prostitution.

High levels of killer T-cells are not normally maintained for long periods. They arise in response to an invading microbe, then subside. So perhaps what's keeping the women immune is constant, low-level exposure to HIV from their johns. When the women take a vacation, their killer T-cells wane, leaving them vulnerable to the virus.

What does this mean for a vaccine? ""It's not good news,"" says Plummer. After all, one would hope that immunity lasted forever, or at least for many years. If frequent booster shots are required, a vaccine would be unaffordable where it's needed most: in the developing world.

But McMichael has a different take on the newly infected women. Kimani found that resistance runs in families, suggesting a genetic trait. Such traits have been found in other people; some Caucasians, for example, have a mutation which makes their cells impregnable to the most common strains of HIV. But the fact that the Pumwani women can get infected is actually ""good news,"" says McMichael. ""Not for those women, of course, but it is good news for a vaccine because it means they don't have some special, undetected genetic immunity that a vaccine couldn't induce.""

By far the biggest obstacle to an AIDS vaccine is the virus itself. For one thing, HIV has many different strains, called subtypes, and the major one in the United States and Europe--and hence the one most used in most candidate vaccines--is different from the dominant subtypes in Africa. No one knows if a vaccine designed against one subtype will protect against infection by a different one.

Then too, people's immune systems are different, composed of various ""HLA types."" Even if infected with the same strain, people often display different viral epitopes on the surface of their cells. These differences tend to correspond with ethnicity, so a vaccine that protects most whites might not be as effective among Asians or Africans.

McMichael has tackled these problems by making his vaccine out of fragments of the HIV subtype most common in Kenya, subtype A. In addition, he has included enough epitopes to cover probably every HLA type in East Africa. Still, McMichael's vaccine contains only 44 epitopes, plus a whole viral gene. Are these enough? And are killer T-cells truly the key to protection?

Most of the uninfected prostitutes appear to produce a special antibody in the place where HIV first enters them: the mucosal tissue of their vaginas. So, should a vaccine induce site-specific antibodies? There are other experimental vaccines that attempt to do exactly that.

No one knows the answers to these questions, but Africans are not waiting for the West to solve the problem. ""I lost my own brother to AIDS two years ago,"" says Anzala, who has dedicated many years to studying the Pumwani sex workers' immune systems. ""That really devastated me, because with all the knowledge I had.... "" His voice trails off; then he snaps back and adds, ""We can't wait for something to come from the U.S. No. We have to participate.""

Indeed, African scientists are actively contributing to the research, providing ideas and laboratory research, pushing scientists to put candidate vaccines into trials on their continent, and insisting that the world develop vaccines that are likely to work against their subtypes of HIV. Uganda is already hosting the continent's first human trial of an AIDS vaccine, and Ugandan researchers are conducting the sophisticated laboratory analyses needed to evaluate the trial. South Africa--which accomplished the world's first successful heart transplant--has the most developed biomedical research capacity in Africa. President Thabo Mbeki has declared an AIDS vaccine a top priority, committing government funds to a soup-to-nuts research effort. ""We're not just trial sites in Africa,"" says Quarraisha Abdool-Karim, a veteran South African AIDS researcher. ""We have an intellectual contribution to make.""

While the Africans are pushing as hard as they can, AIDS scientists around the world are also putting vaccines high on the agenda. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, which dwarfs any other medical research agency in the world, and which spends more than a billion dollars on AIDS research alone, used to give vaccine research less than 10 percent of its AIDS budget, less than any other category of HIV research. But over the last three years it has ratcheted up that percentage, and it has brought in Nobel laureate David Baltimore to lead its effort. Whereas the mood was once pessimistic, most scientists now believe a vaccine is possible.

But even if the scientific obstacles are overcome, another hurdle will remain.

Vast, impoverished, and riven by civil war, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the hardest place on earth to conduct a vaccination campaign. But three times this year, thousands of health workers went out into the countryside, squirting the life-saving pink liquid into the mouths of millions of Congolese babies. In a village outside the town of Mbuji-Mayi, proud mothers held up their vaccinated babies as the whole village celebrated the immunizations. Despite war, the World Health Organization predicts that within a year, the Congo and the world may be polio-free. This is the dream of AIDS-vaccine workers.

But it is also the nightmare, because despite a cheap and effective vaccine, polio is being wiped out only now, about four decades after it was banished from America. Once an AIDS vaccine is developed, will Africa have to wait 40 years for it?

If the vaccine based on the Pumwani prostitutes works, Africa will get it soon. That's because its development is sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), which is laying the groundwork for something that has never happened before: simultaneous delivery of a vaccine to the developed and developing worlds.

IAVI president Seth Berkley, who worked in Uganda during the early days of the AIDS epidemic, is a man in perpetual motion. He has lobbied the World Bank, the EU, the G-7, and any other deep pocket that will listen to create a fund for distributing an AIDS vaccine in the developing world. In addition, IAVI is making sure the vaccines it bankrolls will be available in poor countries.

Berkley has convinced Bill Gates to give his organization $26.5 million and the British government another $23 million; IAVI invests these funds in promising vaccines, fast-tracking them through the pipeline. ""We are like a venture-capital firm,"" Berkley says. ""But instead of demanding 50 percent of the profits, we want access for the poor.""

Essentially, IAVI negotiates agreements that give the manufacturer the option to make the vaccine affordable for developing countries. But if they don't, says Berkley, ""We retain a series of rights that allow us to get the vaccine out there.""

At the Pumwani clinic, Kimani, the young doctor, says, ""We promised the women that anything that came out of the research will benefit them. And they are already asking about the vaccine."" In fact it will be years before the vaccine is ready for large-scale efficacy trials, let alone before researchers know whether it actually protects people. Even when pushed, science crawls.

Meanwhile, Kimani explains what happens as the women approach death. ""When they are clearly deteriorating, we call them in. They ask, 'Am I not doing well?' And we say, 'Maybe it's time to go home to the village.' "" Kimani pauses. ""We have money we can give them to go home to their family."" That statement sinks in, and then Kimani says--shouts, almost--""We desperately need a vaccine!"""
49,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"It's a hot, gray Sunday afternoon in March, and the sprawling Durban train station is almost deserted--hardly the best stage for an AIDS demonstration. Yet sitting on the floor is a small woman named Mercy Makhalemele, one of South Africa's foremost AIDS activists. And she is protesting.

Makhalemele found out she was HIV-positive in 1993. When she told her husband, he shoved her into a pot of water boiling on the stove, scalding her arm. She went to her job selling shoes ""as if everything was okay,"" but her husband showed up telling her to go back home, get her things and leave him, because how could he live with someone infected with HIV? That was at 10:00 in the morning. At 3:00 that afternoon she was fired from her job. Her youngest child, Nkosikhona, meaning ""God is there,"" was born infected. Makhalemele remembers taking her to the hospital and having nurses say, ""She is HIV-positive, there is nothing we can do."" And Makhalemele would insist, ""I'm not asking you to treat her HIV, I'm asking you to treat her bronchitis."" Her child died at two and a half.

For most of this time, Makhalemele tried to push her government--the new government of Nelson Mandela, the most progressive in Africa and maybe the world--to fight AIDS.

It looked like it would be easy. Quarraisha Abdool-Karim is one of South Africa's leading HIV researchers, and she was the first to head the country's AIDS control program. She remembers an AIDS conference in 1992, when Mandela gave the keynote. Abdool-Karim was to speak after him, but, she recalls, ""there was very little to add. He knew all the issues, everything that had to be done.""

But then there was silence. Until the end of 1998, when the prevalence of HIV among South African women attending prenatal clinics surged beyond 20 percent, the only major AIDS speech Mandela gave was to an economic forum in Switzerland. Why he waited so long to confront AIDS remains one of the most maddening enigmas of the epidemic. Mandela declined requests from the Voice for an interview, but even his friend and personal physician, Nthato Motlana, can't plumb it.

""I get so angry,"" Motlana said in an interview earlier this year. ""I go to Mandela--I had breakfast with him this morning--and I give him hell."" Exasperated, he adds, ""The response by the previous apartheid government was a national disgrace. The response by my government--and I'm a very loyal member of the ANC, have been since the age of 18--has also been disgraceful.""

In fact, the new administration made colossal blunders. First, the headstrong health minister, Nkosazana Zuma, authorized a $2.2 million AIDS prevention play, called Serafina II, that hogged a huge portion of the AIDS budget and was widely criticized for being ineffective. Then came Virodene, a locally developed treatment for AIDS. In fact, it contained an industrial solvent, harmful to humans. But Zuma--and Thabo Mbeki, then deputy president and now president of South Africa--championed the drug. When objections were raised by the Medicines Control Council, the South African equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration, Zuma dismissed their concerns, suggesting the council was in league with big pharmaceutical companies that didn't want competition from Virodene.

Finally, in October 1998, the government unveiled its Partnership Against AIDS, a public-private effort that has won high praise for prompting companies, churches, and civic organizations to tackle AIDS. But even as it was being launched, Zuma announced that the government was nixing the so-called ""vaccine for babies,"" a regimen of AZT given to HIV-positive pregnant women that can greatly reduce the chance that babies will be born with HIV. Unaffordable, insisted Zuma, despite a government-funded study showing that giving AZT to pregnant women would save money in the long run, because treating babies with AIDS is very expensive.

Because of her infected daughter, Mak-halemele was especially outraged by the AZT decision. But she was also heartsick about what she saw as the larger issue: ""How do we, as people already infected, fit into the government's program? We don't fit in any way because it's all about prevention."" So she helped start the Treatment Action Campaign, an AIDS activist group patterned partly on ACT UP but also on South Africa's own tradition of protest politics, a tradition epitomized, of course, by Mandela.

Indeed, Mandela may not have done much for AIDS, but he did give his country a political system that responds to ordinary citizens. In a very real sense, he made AIDS activism possible.

But even Mandela couldn't make it easy. While activists everywhere must push politicians, South African AIDS activists must also cope with a society thrown horribly out of joint by modern Africa's most authoritarian, exploitative white regime. In building an AIDS movement, the legacy of apartheid is the biggest obstacle, even more onerous than errant leaders. Apartheid poisoned people with rage, resentment, and despair, creating a culture of violence and stigma that still haunts people with HIV. That's a problem because, before the infected can band together to fight, they must acknowledge they carry the virus. That's hard everywhere, but in South Africa, people who come out as HIV-positive risk physical assault, even murder.

Makhalemele's home region, KwaZulu-Natal, suffered some of the worst terror, because here a three-way war raged between the white regime, the African National Congress, and the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party. AIDS activist Musa Njoko grew up in KwaMashu, a forbidding township outside Durban, the kind of place where people seem so beaten down that they are looking for someone weaker to kick. ""The boys treated me very roughly,"" Njoko recalls. ""I thought someone would get hurt for being HIV-positive."" So she was ""shocked but not surprised"" when last December a woman named Gugu Dlamini declared that she was HIV-positive and got beaten to death three weeks later because, as some of her assailants were heard to say, her honesty shamed the township.

Three months after Dlamini's murder, the Treatment Action Campaign was kicked off with a nationwide petition drive, and Makhalemele, who had worked with Dlamini, decided to confront AIDS stigma by sending her petitioners to KwaMashu. Wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the photo of the slain activist and the slogan ""Never Again,"" about 20 activists arrived in the township shopping center, a dusty place with bars on all the windows. The activists had requested a police escort, but with no police in sight, they fled.

Makhalemele never made it to KwaMashu. A few days earlier she had asked for the train company to provide the activists free transportation from Durban to KwaMashu. She asked again when she got to the station, and again the answer was no--and something inside her snapped. She sat down in the middle of the station, launching a fast that would last for seven days.

Sitting on the floor of the train station, she starts to weep. ""I'm going to a Catholic mission,"" she says. ""I'm going to stay there to heal the sorrow, the pain, the rage I have from working for seven years as an AIDS activist in this country.""

Apartheid was never merely a racial system, but also an economic one that created copious wealth. It is possible to travel to Capetown or Johannesburg and believe one is in London or New York. The mansions are palatial. The phones work. The roads are good. All this gives the country a critical mass of educated, prosperous, urban inhabitants--no longer all white--who have a sense that they are entitled to a democratic society that works as well as any nation anywhere. The comparatively strong economy also means that people with HIV can dare to hope for at least some medication to extend their lives.

Of course, South Africa's wealth was created by ruthless exploitation, so the country is also blighted with poverty on a staggering scale. Illiteracy is rampant. Millions lack electricity and running water. This is what people mean when they talk about South Africa as a country of extremes or, as Mbeki puts it, two countries within the same borders. But this does not begin to describe the far-reaching devastation wreaked upon the nation.

To understand apartheid, go not to KwaMashu or even Soweto, but instead descend in a mine-shaft elevator deep below the surface of the Witswatersrand region to the reef, a band of sediment created millions of years ago by prehistoric rains. It's hard to see the gold, but it's there--tons upon tons of it scattered through the reef in mostly microscopic particles. Here is the simple geological fact has shaped modern South Africa more than anything else: Each ton of Witswatersrand earth yields only a few ounces of gold, and the richest deposits lie buried under eons of newer geological layers. So South African mines must plunge deeper than any others--as far down as five kilometers--and miners have to haul up colossal aggregations of earth. Without very cheap labor, it would have been impossible to make a profit.

Yet gold has long been the country's largest revenue producer. For example, the West Driefontein mine in Carletonville has extracted more than 4.5 million pounds of gold. The company has provided splendid housing for the mine manager: a gated mansion complete with manicured garden. The ordinary laborers also live in company housing. Typical is a room about 20 x 20 feet, crammed with 14 bunk beds and lockers no bigger than those in a school gym. The men who live in this room come from across southern Africa, and they are all married. But their wives are back home. The miners see their families only every two or three months, usually for just a few days at a time.

It is a system that was invented nearly a century ago by the diamond and gold industries. Africans were crowded into reservations, where hut taxes forced them into wage labor. Chiefs were paid to supply men--but only men. Housing black families would cost money, and letting black workers settle permanently in mining towns would make it easier for them to organize resistance. So workers were housed in all-male barracks, called hostels, much like the ones at West Driefontein.

Apartheid's mesh of more than 100 interlocking laws basically nationalized the pattern devised by the mining industry, which at its height employed more than a fifth of black South African adults. Apartheid's hated pass laws, which restricted the movement of blacks, grew out of company policies designed to shuttle workers between their homes and the mines. And in the 1960s, the government forced as many as 3 million Africans into barren and degrading reservations they called Bantustans, an Orwellian term intended to prop up the sham that these were independent nations.

Blacks lucky enough to land a job in a city lived in outlying townships--often, in the early days, with their families. But that changed with the infamous 1964 Bantu Laws Amendments Act, which mandated that new workers live in all-male hostels in the townships. The mining model had become national policy, and the results were disastrous.

""I lived next to a hostel in Soweto, and I would get called to treat someone stabbed or shot."" Motlana recalls. ""The stench in those places! They were filthy. The hostels bred crime, but it goes beyond that. Children were ill-disciplined because they didn't have fathers. It led to so much human abuse.""

It also led to an explosion of AIDS. South Africa has one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, and many researchers believe that the country's system of migrant labor is one of the driving forces. ""If you wanted to spread a sexually transmitted disease, you would take thousands of young men away from their families, isolate them in single-sex hostels, and give them easy access to alcohol and commercial sex,"" says Mark Lurie, a South African researcher who has studied the effect of migrant labor on HIV. ""Then, to spread the disease around the country, you'd send them home every once in a while to their wives and girlfriends. And that's basically the system of migrant labor we have.""

In Carletonville, Yodwa Mzaidume works with the hundreds of prostitutes that live in squatter camps by the mining hostels. She trains them to educate each other to use condoms, but it's hard to involve them in anything beyond that. ""Take Leeupoort,"" she says, referring to one of the squatter camps. ""People there don't have toilets or running water. If you come to them talking about political activism, they ask, 'What's in it for me?' ""

In America, the cry of AIDS activists was simple: ""Drugs into bodies!"" But in South Africa, the needs are so much more complex. Mzaidume ticks off some of them: ""Migrant labor, overcrowding, unemployment, the crime rate. But what are we doing about them? What can we do?"" Migrant labor, she notes, has become so ingrained into South African life that ""mineworkers don't want their families to stay here. They say, 'Who would take care of my cows back home?' ""

Mzaidume doesn't dwell on South Africa's past because what's spreading HIV, she quips, ""is sex with other people, not sex with apartheid."" But with unemployment officially above 30 percent and probably much higher, she says, ""There's a lot of anger among the youth. They say, 'Yes, we are in a democratic South Africa, but we still live in apartheid.' ""

The result is rage. Njoko, the activist who grew up in KwaMashu, explains: ""They'll see me and think, 'She is an HIV-positive woman, how is she doing so well?' And then maybe they'll hurt me or kill me. But when you look deeper you find out the guy has been unemployed for 10 years."" Some men even take out their anger by infecting other people, she says, echoing a common conviction. ""They say they don't want to die alone, they're going to take people with them. I don't support them, but there's absolutely nothing there for the person who is HIV-positive. The message is they're going to die.""

Zackie Achmat is one of the architects of the Treatment Action Campaign. He also fought apartheid, organizing student demonstrations and going to jail for it. Although his ancestry is mixed-race, he called himself black, a tactic of solidarity. He is also a leader of South Africa's flourishing lesbian and gay movement, and with his international connections he could get the very latest medication to treat his HIV. But he has publicly declared that he will not take any drug that is not available to all South Africans.

So when he stood up at a meeting this spring, attended by Zuma, then the minister of health, Achmat had credibility. He told her of his longstanding membership in the ANC, pointed out that the AIDS movement supported her opposition to high pharmaceutical prices, and requested a meeting. To the astonishment of most activists, she agreed. And after the meeting, she reversed her policy on AZT for pregnant women.

It was a stunning victory--and it opened the way for much larger advances, especially on drug prices. It was Zuma who pushed through a law that could allow the South African government to bypass pharmaceutical patents and obtain essential medicines at much lower prices--for example, from companies that make generic versions of the drugs. That made South Africa ground zero in a high-profile battle joined by Western AIDS activists and organizations, such as the Nobel-winning Médecins Sans Frontières, to relax patent and trade restrictions that help keep essential drugs unaffordable. Here was a fight AIDS activists and the South African government shared.

But this fall, President Mbeki shocked activists by saying, ""There exists a large volume of scientific literature alleging that, among other things, the toxicity of this drug is such that it is, in fact, a danger to health."" Never mind that AZT has been evaluated in dozens of trials around the world, that its benefits usually outweigh its side effects, and that countries as strict as Germany and the United States have approved the drug for use against HIV. Indeed, in a study carried out among pregnant women in South Africa, AZT together with another drug showed no more side effects than a placebo. So where did the most powerful person in Africa get the notion that AZT is dangerous?

From the Web, one of his spokespeople, Tasneem Carrim, told the Johannesburg Sunday Independent. Mbeki's office denied it, but what Carrim said had the ring of guileless truth: ""The president goes into the Net all the time,"" she was quoted as saying. Activists had hoped that Mbeki's new health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, would correct him, but to their dismay she has staunchly supported him.

In the township near Carletonville, the percentage of 25-year-old women infected with HIV is a shocking 60 percent. Most of these women will probably get pregnant. ""Why not give a chance to have a baby that is not HIV-positive?"" asks Mzaidume. Then she says, bitterly, ""It doesn't matter how many presentations doctors make, if politicians don't want it, it will not be."" Mbeki did not respond to requests for an interview by the Voice.

Because there is scant medical evidence to support Mbeki's opposition to AZT, many South Africans are casting about for what might have motivated him. Perhaps years in the struggle against apartheid imbued him with mistrust of powerful white corporations, such as pharmaceutical companies. Maybe, too, it instilled a stubbornness that won't allow him to admit he erred. But since Mbeki's specialty is economics, much of the speculation has gravitated in that direction.

The popular notion that apartheid was overthrown by the ANC is only part of the truth. What also happened is that the apartheid economy collapsed. Treating workers as wholly expendable was fine when industry needed mainly unskilled labor. But as technological advancements demanded educated, stable workers, apartheid's migrant labor system backfired, as did the policy of giving blacks only rudimentary education. ""If those stupid fools had just decided to train 100 black engineers a year,"" says Aggrey Klaaste, publisher of theSowetan newspaper, ""this country would be phenomenal.""

But the country was anything but phenomenal when the ANC took power. GDP was actually shrinking. Inflation was running above 15 percent. Capital was fleeing the country. And wasteful spending on police and defense, required to fight an ever bolder black resistance, had burdened the country with a large debt.

Despite being raised by communist parents, Mbeki has charted an aggressively capitalist course. Even though it burdens the economy, he is reassuring international investors by stoically paying off the apartheid-era debt. He has imposed a strict fiscal discipline to accommodate world financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. While such policies may boost South Africa in the long run, they have left the government strapped for cash--and AIDS drugs are expensive. ""They're terrified of starting down the slippery slope of treatment,"" says Achmat, ""because they think it will cost too much.""

That certainly would be true if the government subsidized the costly drug cocktails that have reduced American AIDS deaths. But there is a middle ground. Some of the opportunistic illnesses that kill people with AIDS can be prevented by taking relatively cheap prophylactic drugs. The reason the government isn't providing such drugs is that it isn't being pushed by ""a treatment-literate HIV population that knows its rights,"" says Achmat. ""The level of understanding here is vastly different than in Europe and North America."" At the start of the Treatment Action Campaign, he recalls, people thought AZT was a political party.

That is beginning to change, largely because activists have pushed the issue into the media. Two powerful unions have thrown their weight behind the Treatment Action Campaign, and science itself is pushing the government. There is a new drug, nevirapine, which seems to prevent mother-to-child transmission as effectively as AZT, and at a much cheaper cost. It's being studied in South Africa, and the results of that trial are scheduled for release at the huge World AIDS Conference to be held next year in Durban. It will become harder and harder for the government not to act.

Already a groundswell is apparent. People with HIV are more and more visible. Makhalemele, for example, is back from her five-month retreat and cohosting Beat It!, a national television show on how to live with HIV. On World AIDS Day this month, she says, the media was ""full of AIDS faces."" One of them is the Sowetan's Lucky Mazibuko, the country's first openly HIV-positive columnist. He lives in the township and has become a magnet for people who need someone to talk with. Recently he got a letter that shows how attitudes are changing.

""The letter was from an elderly woman saying she had a son who was HIV-positive, but she had rejected him, chucked him out of house. Now, she was working as a domestic for a white family, and her employer's daughter turned out to be HIV-positive. So as part of her job she has to take care of their daughter--and she only saw her son when he was buried.""

In a country with at least 3.6 million infected, an old African proverb has new relevance: ""Something with horns cannot be hidden."" The sick and dead are forcing South Africans to confront the disease, themselves, and their brutal history."
50,The Village Voice,Mark Schoofs,2000,Africa AIDS,"It's four in the afternoon and Rose Ayo hasn't eaten yet. The 28-year-old mother of five eats only once a day, usually greens mixed with beans or maize meal. She has no job. Her family's food comes from farming a little plot of land and foraging for wild vegetables. Meat is out of the question. Eggs and milk are luxuries she can obtain only a few times a year. Yet one of the key elements of ""positive living""--the basic lifestyle changes that enhance the health of people with HIV-- is a balanced diet. ""That,"" says Ayo, who found out she was infected when her husband died of AIDS three years ago, ""is really hard.""

Things get even harder when she requires medical treatment. ""Last year I fell sick with malaria and vomiting, a basinful of vomit,"" Ayo recalls. ""Instead of paying rent I bought the drugs, and the landlord chased us away from our house."" She fled to her uncle, who gave her and her children shelter in a tent. A year later, that leaky tent is still their home.

Ayo lives in Uganda, the country with probably the best response to AIDS in Africa. Uganda was one of the first places where African AIDS was discovered, among fishing people on the shores of Lake Victoria, and now 9.5 percent of the adults in this country of about 20 million are estimated to be infected. But Uganda boasts some of the continent's most experienced and dedicated AIDS doctors, as well as a renowned prevention program, strong networks of HIV-positive people, and a supportive government. In short, this is a country with everything but money.

So what does AIDS treatment mean in this best of all poverty-stricken nations?

In the industrialized world, powerful drugs called antiretrovirals have sent AIDS death rates plummeting. AIDS hospices have closed, and people with HIV are running marathons and hiking the Appalachian trail. But even at discounted prices, the cost of putting all of Africa's 23.3 million people with HIV on one of the standard three-drug regimens would exceed $150 billion a year. In Uganda, according to one study, such a treatment program would consume more than 60 percent of the country's GDP.

Undaunted, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and a group of pharmaceutical companies are running a pilot project in Uganda that sells HIV drugs at discounts of up to 56 percent. But this program provides antiretrovirals to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of Uganda's HIV-positive population. And many of these lucky patients drive themselves and their families into debt trying to pay for even the least expensive regimens--which often are the least effective.

For the overwhelming majority of Uganda's AIDS patients, the concerns are far more basic. A group of 98 people with HIV, including Ayo, are sitting under two immense trees in Gulu, a city in northern Uganda. Eighty-five say that over the previous year they have endured five or more days without any food at all. ""I'm getting thinner and thinner,"" says Morris Opio, chairman of Gulu Hospital's AIDS counseling organization, Waloko-Kwo. It was in Uganda that AIDS was first dubbed ""slim disease"" because it wastes people into skin-wrapped skeletons. Opio holds out his spindly arms and says, ""I look sick, but it's from no food.""

An hour's drive away, in the town of Lira, ""We don't have shoes or boots, so we're more likely to get infections like rashes and boils from the grass,"" says Juliet Awany, a member of the National Guidance and Empowerment Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (NGEN+). She also worries about diseases, such as worms and dysentery, that are rare in wealthy countries.

But the push for basic medicines has attracted far less attention than the campaign for antiretrovirals, and few if any Western AIDS activists are championing food relief. ""It's only recently, I must admit, that I became aware"" that hunger was the leading concern among rural Africans with HIV, says UNAIDS director Peter Piot, who spent years working in Africa. Yet across the continent, hunger stalks people with HIV.

Studies from Zambia and Malawi have found that patients often consider food their most important need. The Zambian study also looked at home care and discovered that, when a patient dies, the family mourns not only the loved one but also the end of food aid. Even in Uganda's relatively prosperous capital, Kampala, patients say they often have trouble achieving a balanced diet, with most complaining that meat and fresh fruit are too expensive. As for drugs, Vincent Wandera, who has HIV, says simply, ""They write you medicines, you fail to buy.""

No wonder veteran AIDS doctor Peter Mugyenyi says that treatment in Uganda ""means frustration."" Noting that industrialized countries have only a small proportion of the world's people with HIV, Mugyenyi says, ""The medicines are where the problem is not, and the problem is where the medicines are not. The reason this cannot be put right is economics. It makes no difference how many die. It's a hard-nosed business decision. As long as we don't have money, they will just ignore us."" [See box, ""Of Patents and Pills.""]

As Africans struggle to sort out their agonizing treatment priorities--food? clean water? basic medicines?--they must also cope with the emotions that arise with an endless tide of deaths that they now know are preventable. ""It was easier when there was nothing at all to treat HIV,"" says Lillian Mworeko, an HIV-positive school teacher and member of NGEN+. ""Now there is something, so it's like seeing food when you're starving, but you can't eat.""

ELLY KATABIRA COPES BY BLOCKING OUT everything except ""that patient sitting in front of me."" Katabira founded the AIDS clinic at Uganda's flagship Mulago Hospital in Kampala and co-wrote Africa's first manual on HIV care. In that book, he laid out his philosophy: ""Use what you have.""

Through extensive research and observation, Katabira and his colleagues have tweaked medical care. Thrush--a painful fungal infection of the mouth and throat--afflicts virtually every HIV patient, making it hard to eat because of the pain of swallowing. The cheapest treatment is nystatin; Ugandan doctors found that sucking the tablets rather than swallowing them gets more of the drug absorbed into the tissues of the mouth, making it more effective. Skin rashes are also extremely common among HIV patients. ""There was a tendency to look at the skin alone,"" Katabira says. But if the rash is bad, he prescribes a sedative. ""It allows the patient to relax and sleep, so he's refreshed and able to make himself active, which in turn means he's less likely to scratch.""

""What I think is most important,"" he continues, ""is support--counseling and reassurance that, yes, you are sick, but there are a lot of things you can do to improve your living without medicine. Simple things, like reducing your alcohol intake and going to the doctor as soon as you feel sick. And dealing with dependents. A parent will never get better if she's worried about her children. These things are considered second-rate, but I think they're very important.""

The ultimate proof: ""Our patients are living longer. I'm proud of that. Without protease inhibitors, they are living longer.""

Yet the hard reality is that without such advanced drugs, the virus keeps replicating, slowly destroying the immune system. Almost all the infections that result can be treated--in rich countries. But in Uganda, says Katabira, ""if you get CMV [a viral infection that blinds and kills], that's the end of the story. The drugs are just too expensive."" Same for cryptococcal meningitis. What's more, CMV and the main AIDS pneumonia PCP are both preventable--but not with Third World budgets. The painful genital sores of herpes simplex, which most Ugandan HIV patients get, are easily controlled with acyclovir, but Katabira reckons that ""less than 1 percent of my patients can afford it.""

""Many people think that because I'm in the field of AIDS, I look at it as something special. No,"" Katabira says. ""The problem is wider. I go to the pediatric ward, and kids are dying because there's no amoxicillin,"" a basic antibiotic. ""I could have walked away in protest, but I must do each and every thing possible to get my patient through the next day. Use what you have.""

PATRICK OKELLO, A TALL HIV-POSITIVE patient living in Lira, has the mango tree. He boils its roots, which helps him fight diarrhea. Many people go to traditional healers to get herbal remedies. Indeed, up to 85 percent of Africans consult healers, not surprising given that they are far more plentiful than physicians and that they hold an esteemed position in most African cultures.

Western doctors have tended to dismiss their efforts. But in Uganda, some of the first evidence emerged that herbal remedies can effectively treat AIDS-related illnesses. A study of patients with chronic diarrhea or herpes zoster found that those treated by traditional healers fared slightly better than those given Western medicines. Studies in Zimbabwe and Senegal have confirmed that some traditional treatments work against some illnesses, especially diarrhea. And healers can make a patient feel cared for, an important psychological boost.

Unfortunately, there is no way to tell who is a charlatan, or even which remedies given by a well-meaning healer are truly effective. Awany, the woman who wishes she had shoes to protect against rashes and boils, went to a traditional healer for diarrhea; the herbs he gave her only worsened the problem. ""When I told him it didn't work, he said it was washing out the stomach to wash away the germs. I was almost at the dying point when I went to the hospital."" But over in the next town, Rose Aciro swears by the thrush treatment she gets from her healer.

Most Ugandan healers claim to alleviate opportunistic illnesses, but only a few profess to cure AIDS itself. Not even antiretrovirals can do that, but they do keep the virus in check, which is why David wants them. This January, the trim, articulate partner in an advertising and media firm, who asked that his real name not be used, started triple combination therapy through the UNAIDS program. Including all the laboratory tests, the treatment costs him between 8 and 9 million Ugandan shillings a year, or about 6250 U.S. dollars. That would have been bearable last year, when his company landed a one-time windfall contract and David took home about 20 million shillings, or $14,000. But this year, he says, ""I won't make half of that.""

Speaking in early September, David said he had already been forced off his drugs. He was two months behind on the rent for his family's two-bedroom apartment. He had cut their meat consumption by 60 percent. And now, his children's school fees were coming due. Did he have the money? He smiled ruefully and shook his head. ""If I had it I would buy drugs. I wouldn't think of school fees when my life is at stake.""

Out of Uganda's estimated 930,000 people with HIV, only 852 are receiving antiretrovirals through UNAIDS, according to the most recent figures. About three quarters of them are taking only two drugs, not the usual three, and most of those are taking AZT and 3TC, a regimen considered substandard in the United States.

Rose Byaruhanga is chief counselor at the clinic where David gets his drugs. A motherly woman, she knows her patients intimately. ""Most are paying with their savings,"" she says. ""When you look six or eight months down the line, there's no way they can afford it.""

As for David, ""I lie in my bed, but I can't find sleep. I make calculations on how I can get this money. I look at one option, then at another option. I go to bed at 10:00, but I fall asleep at 3:00 or 4:00. I just lie there and think.""

PETER NSUMUGA ALSO WORRIES ABOUT money. He runs Uganda's Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Project, which provides drugs not only for STIs, but also for common AIDS opportunistic infections. But the Ugandan government puts up only 5 percent of the cost, and the program is due to expire next year. ""If nothing replaces it,"" says Nsumuga, ""it would leave a big gap."" Spurred on by the International Monetary Fund, Uganda now requires patients to pay for many medical services, including drugs. Could this revenue raising scheme pay for the medicines? ""Very unlikely,"" says Nsumuga. ""These drugs are damned expensive.""

That's one reason Africans with AIDS usually don't go to the hospital until they are at death's door. Josca Lalaa lives in one of the crowded displaced-persons camps that dot the countryside around Gulu, which has suffered many years of civil strife. Such camps are not unusual in Africa, with its 3.2 million refugees. In December 1996, Lalaa started coughing up blood, but she didn't seek treatment for six months.

Lalaa was suffering from tuberculosis, one of the most common AIDS-related illnesses. But if she starts coughing up blood again, she might not get a bed at Gulu hospital. The TB ward used to have an annex--a tent that held half the TB beds. But ants ate away at the cloth, the ropes, and even the wooden poles. By last year, when the hospital surrendered to the inevitable and took down the tent, its floor was in tatters, exposing patients to the bare earth.

Over the last eight years, TB cases in Gulu have quadrupled, thanks mainly to HIV. But there is no money for a new tent, so the TB ward admits only the sickest patients. It runs at 150 to 170 percent capacity, with patients sleeping on the floor.

Charles Odonga is the main AIDS doctor at Gulu Hospital. He explains that because patients keep flooding in, the hospital has limited their stay to two days. ""If they go beyond two days, they are occupying someone else's place,"" he says. ""So we push them out."" Many patients don't bother to come at all, he says, ""because they are aware of what we can and can't offer."" And when those who are on the ward sense that death is near, they or their families often ask to be discharged. ""They reason, 'Let's use money we still have for transport home, because it's cheaper when the person is still alive than it is to transport a dead body.' ""

Odonga came to Gulu specifically to work with HIV patients, and ""there are specific incidents where you give a patient a few extra days,"" he says. ""But sometimes I wonder, should I just resign and go? Am I doing anything?""

Odonga has been at Gulu for less than a year, so the shock of ""the limitations of the place"" is still new. Not so for nurse Florence Opoka, who opened Gulu Hospital's HIV counseling unit nine years ago. Two years later, in 1992, she wanted to quit. ""There was no drug,"" she says. ""I could only help you to the grave."" But as patients get weaker, she says, ""they become closer to me. They come to my house, and when they die, they leave wills. They even leave me their children."" Opoka is raising four orphans from four different patients.

Has Opoka seen any significant improvements in AIDS care over the last nine years? ""No,"" she says, looking away. Then she explains: At the moment, the hospital doesn't even have medicine for bilharzia, a common water-borne parasite, and it has also run out of a key malaria medicine. But what hurts the most is that food donations to her organization were cut this year. Virtually none of her patients has enough to eat.

Still, like Elly Katabira, she uses what she has. ""I open my home,"" she says. ""If I have millet or bread, I share the little I have.""

Of Patents and Pills
If David Sekirevu didn't have well-connected friends who could procure drugs, he would be dead. He contracted cryptococcal meningitis--one of the most feared AIDS-related illnesses--and the drug that fights it, fluconazole, is far too expensive for Sekirevu and the vast majority of Ugandans. But does it have to be?

AIDS activists say no, and point to Thailand. When pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had a fluconazole monopoly there, the price of a daily dose was $14. But when local companies started manufacturing generic versions, the price tumbled to about 70 cents, a 95 percent drop. Thai companies also make generic AZT; the price of that AIDS drug has fallen by almost three-quarters.

Activists want the United States and world trade bodies to allow poor countries to manufacture more life-saving drugs or import them at lower prices. When countries such as South Africa moved to do so, the U.S. threatened trade sanctions. But after ACT UP dogged Vice President Gore, the U.S. backed off.

The fight over drugs called antiretrovirals, which target HIV directly, has generated the most publicity. One company under fire is Bristol-Myers Squibb, which makes the AIDS drug ddI. For a United Nations pilot program in Uganda, Bristol sells the drug for less than $160 a month, a discount from First World prices but still astronomically expensive for most Africans. Activists argue that, because the U.S. government funded the development of ddI, its price should be much lower. Bristol retorts that it purchased the patent from the government and invested in clinical trials, so it deserves to control the price. More broadly, the pharmaceutical industry argues that profits feed new research.

Bristol also points to its AIDS charitable program, launched this year, which will donate $100 million to several African countries. But critics point out that Bristol CEO Charles Heimbold Jr. took home a 1998 pay package of more than $56 million and retained about $200 million in stock options.

Relaxing patent laws is no panacea. Patents for many of the compounds on the United Nations essential drug list have expired, yet distribution remains spotty. In much of rural Africa, only half of children get vaccinations, and only 30 percent have clean water.

The experience of tuberculosis is sobering. Though the disease can be fully cured with relatively cheap drugs, African TB programs have been hobbled by such basic problems as lack of electricity to run diagnostic tests. The continent's crushing poverty breeds ""theft of drugs at every point in the distribution system,"" as veteran researcher Susan Allen recently wrote. Patients, for example, sell their pills as soon as they feel better, even though they are not yet cured. AIDS cannot be cured, and HIV drugs must be taken for life, which means that treating AIDS will have even more pitfalls.

Finally, for many Africans with HIV, the first need is not medicine but food. Elhadj Sy of the United Nations AIDS Program calls the push for cheap antiretrovirals ""commendable,"" but adds, ""For people in the West, going hungry is very abstract. They don't know what it is."" He draws an analogy to a major effort by the UN years ago to build hygienic latrines in rural Africa. ""I remember in one of the villages an old man asked a very simple question. 'My children,' he said, 'don't you think you are trying to solve the problem from the wrong end?'"""
51,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"The mad people of Ibba hardly seem the harbingers of a health crisis consuming Africa.

At first glance, their insanity almost seems understandable, the human fallout from 16 grinding years of civil war.

There are the two farmers, grown men, who have regressed to childhood, playing together with sticks and pebbles in nearby mango groves. There is the young mother who has gone berserk, chasing villagers with a rusty machete. Lost souls stroll through the surrounding woodlands stark naked. And one villager, a shy young man, has had to be tied to a granary wall by his family. Inexplicably, he was setting neighbors' huts on fire.

""About five years ago, when all this started happening, some people laughed at it,"" said Anthony Badagbu, a health worker at Ibba's thatch-roofed hospital. ""Now people are crying because we know it kills. People go crazy, fall into a coma and die.""

If not exactly weeping, global health experts are certainly stunned by the bizarre outbreak of dementia in Ibba and dozens of isolated villages like it in rebel-held Sudan. The madness is late-stage sleeping sickness, a lethal, long-vanquished foe from the age of Stanley and Livingstone, and its baleful reappearance is just the latest sign of Africa's seemingly unstoppable slide into a health disaster of historic proportions.

Spread by the bite of tsetse flies, sleeping sickness was virtually wiped out generations ago. Now, it is believed to infect at least 300,000 people in countries as far-flung as Sudan and Angola. Entire villages have been depopulated, something not seen here since colonial times. ""This is extremely depressing, like setting back the clock 60 years,"" said Simon Gould, a medical researcher with the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, which recently opened a new sleeping sickness hospital in Ibba. ""You get to a point in Africa where you say, 'OK, we've touched bottom.' But sleeping sickness proves we haven't. So if this doesn't set off alarm bells, I don't know what will."" At the millennium, alarm bells are clanging louder than ever over the health woes of the world's second-largest continent. AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, Lassa fever, meningitis -- the litany of diseases lashing Africa at the advent of the 21st Century is, if anything, longer than the bestiary of epidemics that have struck before. And in a shrinking world linked by easy jet travel, fears are rising that Africa's problems can become global as diseases spill out from the continent and spread across the world. What elevates this crisis above Africa's earlier health calamities, experts say, is not just its daunting scale and complexity, but its resistance to the familiar solution of unloading donated United Nations medicines on some dusty, bedraggled airstrip. Chronic wars, unrelieved poverty, rapid urbanization and corruption are still the traditional villains in the sickening of Africa. Yet today, those home-grown culprits are being abetted by powerful forces from far beyond Africa's shores.

Orphans of the Cold War, African governments have seen their share of foreign aid from the world's richest nations shrink by 20 percent since the late 1980s, when the region was a favorite chessboard for East-West conflict. Now, the United Nations can't even muster three-fifths of the $800 million in donations it says it needs for humanitarian and health emergencies on the continent.

The rise of capitalism in the 1990s has delivered a cruel one-two punch to Africa's socialized health systems. Government health programs have been trimmed back or privatized-- often at the behest of the World Bank or International Monetary Fund-- just when the region is gripped by the worst plague in modern history.

And in perhaps the bitterest irony of all, the pharmaceutical industry has poured billions into curing rich countries' diseases -- cancer, for example, is on the retreat in the United States -- while ignoring research into cures for ailments of Africa's poor.

The economics for drug companies are simple: There is no profit to be made from a diseased Sudanese who doesn't belong to an HMO that can pick up the tab.

Taken together, the impact of all these factors on Africa's 650 million people has been bleak:

- At the beginning of a new century, when citizens of the developed world can look forward to medical advances that may boost their life span to 120 years, the life expectancy of millions of Africans is dropping -- in some cases apocalyptically. Zimbabwe, which boasted a life expectancy of 61 nearly a decade ago, will see its people die, on average, by age 40 in 2005. According to one UN report, much of sub-Saharan Africa may see a similar drop over the next 25 years.

- AIDS, the single biggest culprit behind that catastrophic mortality rate, shows no sign of burning itself out on the continent. Some 23 million people, or more than 70 percent of the world's carriers of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, already live in Africa. Countries such as Uganda have checked the disease's advance through public education, but in other regions where the infections are leveling off, the cause is more dismal. All those at risk already have the disease and will be dead within a decade.

- According to the World Health Organization, an infectious disease crisis ""of global proportions"" is brewing in the developing world, and hitting Africa especially hard. Fully 20 of 33 new and unexpected epidemics since 1994 have erupted in Africa,where only 11 percent of the world's population lives. This rogue's gallery of ailments includes everything from yellow fever to plague, brucellosisto Ebola.

""This is not the African renaissance we expected,"" said Pierre Kombila, the health minister of Gabon, invoking the upbeat imagery currently popular with Africa's leaders. ""We do not expect outside solutions. But people must understand that these are not just our problems anymore. With globalization, they are everybody's.""

An ancient scourge
Perhaps no epidemic captures that intertwining of global and local interests better than the surprise resurgence of sleeping sickness, a drama of human suffering that's playing out not just in the war-raked savannas and forests of southern Sudan, but in gleaming boardrooms of pharmaceutical firms in Europe and the United States.

The disease itself is ancient -- caused by a wormlike, one-celled parasite called a trypanosome, whose ferocity once deprived humans of access to nearly two-thirds of the richest food-producing lands in sub-Saharan Africa. Until the development of modern drugs, entering the vast kingdom of the vector, the blood-sucking tsetse fly, was suicidal. A single outbreak in Uganda between 1902 and 1906 killed 200,000 Africans and colonists.

Injected into the host by the fly, the parasite migrates through the circulatory system to the brain, where it mysteriously triggers trembling, lethargy, erratic behavior and, if left untreated, coma and death. One variety, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, is endemic to East Africa and can kill within weeks. The West African variety, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, takes up to several years of increasing debilitation to become fatal.

Gambiense, the slow killer, is the culprit in Sudan's hot zone, Western Equatoria province.Not coincidentally, the conditions that exist today in the area are so primitive they mimic the tsetse killing grounds of preindustrial Africa. Years of civil war between the country's Arabic north and rebels from the black Christian and animist south, where many people believe everything in nature has a living soul, have turned the province into one of most backward places on Earth.

A few red-dustroads swallowed by elephant grass are the only tangible legacy of British rule,which ended in 1956. There is not a single working telephone, flush toilet or paved road -- much less a modern hospital -- within 30,000square miles.Travel is by foot. A pane of window glass is a novelty. So,until recently,was money, with most transactions being carried out by barter in scattered villages.

About all that is left in abundance in Western Equatoria these days is tsetse flies and tens of thousands of sick people -- all of them carrying sleeping sickness.

""In the old days the British hired 'fly boys' to go stand in the bush and attract tsetse flies,"" said Lasu Lauya Joja, 43, a Sudanese relief worker with CARE International, which is conducting sleeping sickness screening campaigns in the area. ""The boys would take off their shirts and have a partner who swatted the flies before they bit. They got paid a bounty for each fly.""

Joja said that the work of decades of fly-control programs, including more modern efforts to clear the undergrowth favored by the tsetse, have been undone since rebels warmed into the province in 1990. Worse yet, the few Western charities that were treating sleeping sickness with modern medicines, shrinking the human reservoir for the disease and thus reducing reinfection rates, also packed up and fled.

""Thousands of people ran into the bush to escape the fighting -- we found some dressed only in leaves when we first got here (in 1994),"" said Joja. ""But out in the bush even more people got bitten by flies and soon what have you got? Boom! An outbreak of a disease that shouldn't even exist anymore.""

In the village of Ezo, where CARE has set up a field headquarters, the incidence of sleeping sickness rocketed from less than 1 percent of the local population in 1989 to a peak of 43 percent in 1997. Local chiefs say they buried about 2,200 of the brain parasite's victims in the interim years of isolation before outsiders returned to Equatoria.

""We had forgotten what it was,"" said Erneo Nbino, 64, whose grown son, Costaki, died of the illness. ""At first we thought it was malaria because he became very tired and slept all the time. But when he was awake, he didn't recognize me, he insulted me and wanted to fight all the time. He became a different person.""

Nbino, sporting a heavy wool coat and shorts under the hammering tropical sun, was standing in line to be tested for sleeping sickness in Ezo.

CARE technicians had set up their battery-powered centrifuges in the shade of some mango trees. The medics pricked fingers to draw blood samples. And out of some 260 people examined that morning, 46 were positive, including two more of Nbino's sons and their wives.

The old man walked stone-faced back to his forest hut 4 miles away, surrounded by 14 grandchildren he would have to support if more of his family members died.

Costly cure
""The good news is that we can cure them,"" said Michaleen ""Mickey"" Richer, a doctor with International Medical Corps, a relief organization. ""The bad news is what we use to cure them with.""

Richer, an American, was the first person to grasp the full scope of the sleeping sickness disaster in Sudan. Bashing along disused back roads in a dented-up Landcruiser, she and her colleagues screened 36,000 people for the disease and treated 2,800, doubtless saving many lives.

But in the process, Richer stumbled across an even greater malady that no heroics could cure: the iniquities of the global pharmaceutical trade.

""The drugs are extraordinarily expensive,"" she said. ""To actually stop this epidemic, treating relapse cases and getting things back to where they were just 10 years ago,could eventually cost millions. With the way humanitarian aid has dried up,that probably isn't going to happen.""

Two drugs are used to cure sleeping sickness. Pentamidine, used for the earlier stages of the infection, costs $1,200 per treatment, though the World Health Organization managed to procure some at a reduced cost. Melarsoprol, the drug of choice once the trypanosome invades the brain, costs about $100, still far out of African patients' reach.

To make matters worse, some of the drugs are antique -- and highly toxic. Melarsoprol,a concoction that hit the market in 1947, hasn't been improved on in a half-century. For drug companies, it simply isn't profitable enough to invest in research. One doctor describes it as the chemical equivalent of ""arsenic suspended in car antifreeze solution.""

""It's so painful that I've seen grown men cry and women scream when I inject it,"" Richer said. ""But if I don't, they die.""

About 5 percent die anyway, from side effects.

One recent afternoon, Richer checked up on dozens of sleeping sickness patients at the Tambura hospital, a rural compound that, like everything else in southern Sudan,is dog-eared with neglect.

Walking down a cramped ward clogged with gourds, baskets of peanuts, playing children and semiconscious bodies, she came upon a man, Simon, who was dying because he wasn't responding to the drugs.

""We don't want to lose this man,"" said Richer, a short, effusive Coloradan, to nobody in particular while hugging the patient. ""He is very handsome. He is very bright. We don't want him to die.""

Simon sat limply on his palm mat, glassy-eyed and smiling with embarrassment. Two months earlier, the world's last stocks of DFMO, the second-chance drug for relapsed sleeping sickness patients, had expired. The manufacturer, Hoechst Marion Roussel, a multinational drug firm, had phased it out for lack of profitability.

When it comes to global economic forces ganging up on sickly Africa, no issue stirs more passions than fair access to lifesaving drugs.

""Withholding foreign aid means you're just selfish,"" said Bernard Pecoul, a pharmaceutical expert with Doctors Without Borders in Paris. ""But to cut off the supply of drugs because people can't pay -- that's like the developed world turning Africa out of its sickbed. It's venal.""

Humanitarian groups see drug accessibility as one of the greatest health dilemmas of the new century.

According to Doctors Without Borders, the international pharmaceutical industry has been neglecting ""poor people's diseases"" for years. Of the 1,450 new medicines brought to market between 1975 and 1997, they say, only 11 directly target the sorts of tropical ailments common in Africa.

And even when the maladies of the rich and poor overlap, the most famous instance being AIDS, cost and intellectual property rights are still putting medicines beyond reach.

A celebrated case in point: When AIDS-plagued South Africa hinted that it might manufacture its own AZT, an expensive anti-retroviral drug, the U.S. government, backed by the pharmaceutical industry, threatened sanctions. Patent laws were at stake. And despite President Clinton's recent promise to intervene on South Africa's behalf, the confrontation remains at an impasse.

Deadly paradox
Paradoxically,standoffs between the globe's sick and wealthy may only get worse as medical science gets better.

""The costs of research and development are extraordinary,"" said Lori Kraut, a spokeswoman for Hoechst Marion Roussel, the drug firm that manufactured the discontinued sleeping sickness medicine. ""We have to invest our money wisely to see a return.""

Industry sources say the cost of researching, testing and bringing a sophisticated new drug to consumers can now reach $500 million -- making the sparse markets of Africa even less tempting.

Nonetheless, Kraut said her company, which recently merged to form Aventis Pharma, based in Frankfurt, Germany, is trying to do right by the people of Sudan.

HMR has transferred the DMFO patent to the World Health Organization, which is looking for anew manufacturer. The company has also turned over the last remaining stocks of its drug, free of charge. A one-year supply will be available soon.

""The Sudanese are actually the luckiest sleeping sickness victims in Africa,"" said Anne Moore, an epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ""They're the only ones who are accessible enough to help. Hundreds of thousands of others in Congo and Angola are isolated by fighting. Nobody really knows what's happening to them.""

Many of the residents of the tiny, mud-walled village of Ibba do feel lucky.

They say they are lucky to be alive after so many years of war. And though the northern government in Khartoum still sends the occasional Soviet-built Antonov bomber droning overhead to drop a bomb, most of the ground combat has moved far to the north, into the land of the Dinkas.

In the interlude of peace the foreign doctors have come. They are banking the flames of sleeping sickness.

""We thank the Lord for their help, but we Africans are fighting this disease with all our might too,"" said Elija Gadri, 60, the Episcopal pastor of Ibba. ""We fight it with our hearts, like Queen Gulana.""

Gadri recalled proudly how the village matriarch, Gulana Sekina Gidam, organized the frightened, dying people of Ibba into groups and ordered them to be injected with medicine. At church, she used a bullhorn to cajole them into building the new sleeping sickness hospital. She danced at its opening.

Gidam is buried across the dirt road from Gadri's thatch-roofed church. Sleeping sickness didn't get her. She was the village's first victim of Melarsoprol, the toxic old drug that kills 5 percent of its users."
52,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"Thandiwe Mwandla can't give away her sugar cane these days, much less sell it. The same goes for her sweet bananas and corn and the hard little peaches that grow in her garden. The fruit has AIDS, people say.

Switching from farmer to tailor, Mwandla, 45, a resourceful and stubborn woman, has tried sewing dozens of bright new skirts and aprons to sell. Nobody buys them. They too, neighbors say, carry the killer disease.

More recently, she trudged to the local health clinic and cajoled the doctors there into paying her a modest stipend to teach AIDS awareness courses. At the designated times, however, the classroom stands empty. Like her fruit and clothing, Mwandla is being shunned. And her crime isn't simply that she is HIV positive.

""People die here every week from AIDS, but we pretend not to notice,"" said the mother of five, whose electrician husband died of AIDS in 1994, leaving her with no means of support. ""My crime is that I've told people I have HIV. That has made me an outcast.""

Neighbors walk a broad circle around her property, she said. Others have warned her not to visit their homes. Sitting in a crumbling, tin-roofed house she can longer afford to repair, she summed up the schizophrenic world of AIDS-plagued Esidubwini.

""We get sick and we get poorer,"" she said bitterly, ""and we die lying to ourselves.""

Staring into the abyss of an incomprehensibly brutal epidemic, it is plain how the 23 million people who live with HIV in Africa can drift easily into numbing fatalism, or a fierce, hardening shell of denial.

Nearly 20 years after it roared out of the continent's jungles, the savage virus that goes by many oblique names here -- ""that other thing,"" they call it in Zimbabwe; ""white man's disease"" is its delusional nickname in Gabon -- has wrecked decades of health and welfare gains and turned optimistic predictions about a new, robust African Century into a cruel joke.

According to a United Nations report released this month, Africa's AIDS catastrophe is not only unchecked but, chillingly, also accelerating even as the death rate drops in rich countries thanks to expensive drug therapies. The continent already is home to almost 70 percent of the world's HIV-positive people, experts note, and that bleak lead is only likely to widen in the next century.

AIDS is a democratic killer in Africa. Unlike in the West, it is not associated with urban and gay populations. Spread from husband to wife, through prostitutes or teenage sex, it burns through the rural communities where most Africans live. For the first time in the history of the pandemic, more women than men are infected; hundreds of thousands of African babies are born with HIV.

13 million deaths
A staggering 13 million Africans have died from AIDS, or 90 percent of global death toll. Five years from now that number will breach 20 million, a figure surpassing the wholesale die-off in medieval Europe at the height of the bubonic plague.

Yet as numbingly high as these numbers may be, they cannot begin to show how an obscure monkey virus that managed to jump to human beings, possibly when a hunter gutted an infected chimpanzee in the forests of Cameroon decades ago, is unraveling the fabric of entire societies and threatening to bring Africa's economy to its knees.

Fields in Zimbabwe, for example, stand untilled because tens of thousands of farmers are enfeebled by HIV, which infects a quarter of the total population. So many adults have died in the AIDS hot zones of East and southern Africa that some villages are turning into dazed outposts of orphans. In the United States, by contrast, the national incidence rate is only a fraction of 1 percent.

The impact on African business is incalculable. Some experts predict that agriculture, the pillar of most African economies, may have to shift slowly away from lucrative, labor-intensive export crops such as coffee due to a lack of workers. An oil refinery in Zambia recently bankrupted itself with the AIDS-related costs of workers' medical care and burial fees.

And in South Africa, where a staggering 45 percent of the country's mine workers may carry the virus, the outlay for health benefits for ailing employees is expected to more than double by 2005.

Culturally, the disease is eating away at the famous safety net provided by Africa's extended family system. There are simply too many victims to cope.

Beleaguered presidents, faced with massive diversions of resources to AIDS, have pushed unenforceable laws against long-held tribal practices such as wife inheritance and clan ""uncles"" who initiate girls into sex.

Virginity testing
The Zulus in South Africa even have revived long-forgotten practices such as virginity testing to stanch horrific 30 percent HIV prevalence rates in Kwazulu-Natal.

And in one of the ironies of the great AIDS pandemic, stunned policymakers in African capitals are watching their frail national health systems sink under millions of AIDS cases -- precisely at a time when public spending is shackled by austerity programs imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

""How is AIDS upending society? How will our economies survive the next 20 or 30 years? Anybody who claims to know is a liar,"" said Alan Whiteside, a health economist at South Africa's University of Natal. ""Basically, we're still at the beginning of this epidemic. All I can say is that harsh decisions are going to have to be made. Some (leaders) won't make them, and their countries are going to fail dismally.""

Just an hour's drive north of Whiteside's university, in rural towns such as Esidubwini, nestled in the rolling hills of a region so beautiful that white settlers named it after England's famously lush Midlands, a small, heartbreaking window into that future is already opening.

In some Midlands communities, up to 40 percent of the residents, mostly ethnic Zulus, will be dead from AIDS within a decade, the highest incidence in the world.

Why this is happening is a tale of callousness and despair, and a classic example of how AIDS has hopscotched around the continent, cursing some regions and leaving others virtually intact, probing for the right social conditions -- poverty, promiscuity, unprotected sex -- that favor the transmission of the fatal virus.

""In Africa, AIDS is a heterosexual disease, and migration is its handmaiden,"" said Anwar Hoosen, a social worker with the AIDS Training Information and Counseling Center, a government agency in the nearby city of Pietermaritzburg.

""These small rural towns have been the labor pool for mines and big farms for generations,"" Hoosen said. ""The guys leave to work for months at a time, they have sex with prostitutes and bring the disease back home to kill their families.""

South Africa's old white rulers designed mass labor migrations to tear up black social networks, he added. Where it failed, AIDS has come back to finish the job. In places such as Esidubwini, a jumble of houses and cane fields graced by huge operatic clouds that boil up in the afternoons, battered family structures are collapsing because of AIDS.

""My husband was the one who infected me but he tried to hide his sickness,"" said Mwandla, the mother ostracized for revealing her HIV. ""He came home from his job one day, and I found him laying sick on the porch saying, 'I wish I were dead!' and then I knew it. I almost fainted. He got it from his girlfriends.""

Hired on the sly
Mwandla nursed her husband, Joe, for two years before he died. The medical bills sucked up her meager savings. Deprived of her usual sources of income by AIDS paranoia, she barely makes ends meet by working as a maid or laborer at a dollar a day for people who hire her on the sly.

""I can't be seen at their homes,"" she says without self-pity but with a certain scarred hardness. Her five children, born after disease entered the family, are HIV negative. But her house is unkempt and dingy in ways that have nothing to do with poverty but with demoralization.

In fact, most households in rural Esidubwini are headed by single mothers, many with children fathered by different men.

Clad in bright head scarves and smocks, the women hoe their small scraps of field to earn money because there is no other employment. They die from mysterious ailments that everybody calls pneumonia and are buried on weekends in graves topped with paper flowers. Otherwise, the town is largely a manless place. The young men come home only to die, leaving behind a burgeoning army of AIDS orphans, some now heading their own households.

""Does this sound normal to you?"" said Sbongile Shabane, one of the few local AIDS activists. ""Then why do we go on pretending as if nothing is happening?""

Shabane, the director of an AIDS awareness group called Siyaphila -- Zulu for ""We are Alive"" -- says the deep, bruising culture of shame and denial surrounding the disease in Africa is perhaps the biggest obstacle to bringing the scourge under control.

Her own group is a rueful case in point: It consists of HIV carriers who, like herself, have had the courage to go public. Though it is based in Kwazulu-Natal, a South African province where at least 2 million HIV-positive people live, Siyaphila has fewer than two dozen members.

""To be HIV positive is to be less than human,"" Shabane said. ""I have seen people turned out by their families. One woman was carted out of her house in a wheelbarrow when her family found out she had AIDS. Nobody wants to deal with this.""

Or with Shabane. She was recently chased out of a black township outside the city of Durban by an angry mob of youths who charged that her advocacy work was bringing disgrace to the community. Similarly, in South Africa's most celebrated case of AIDS-phobia, a young activist named Gugu Dlamini was beaten to death by a gang of youths in 1998 after announcing that she had HIV.

""It's ignorance, it's fear, it's our taboos about sex,"" said Shabane, an exuberant woman who is prone to spontaneous bouts of dancing on her rounds through the muddy backstreets of AIDS-stricken Midlands communities.

""We are a bewildered people,"" she said. ""We are expressing our fears in strange ways.""

One of those ways has been the revival of an ancient Zulu custom, virginity testing for young girls.

Fertility ritual
Long abandoned, the tests were once integral to fertility rituals among the Zulu. But today, hundreds if not thousands of young women are doffing their blue jeans and sneakers, donning short beaded aprons, and standing bare-breasted on hillsides, waiting to undergo genital examinations by teams of plastic-gloved matriarchs. The purpose: Use tradition to shore up a dam against a tide of teen pregnancy and AIDS.

""The ancestors tell me in my dreams to revive such things,"" said Nomagugu Patience Ngobese, 43, a sangoma, or faith healer, who has spearheaded the tests. ""We have adopted too many Western things without thinking and we lost respect for our bodies. This has allowed things like AIDS to come torture us.""

Some local doctors see the exams as a gasp of cultural desperation in the face of AIDS.

""There is no easy way even for a trained doctor to determine virginity, and if you notice, they're only putting pressure on the girls,"" said Neil Mckerrow, a pediatrician and AIDS expert at Edendale Hospital in Pietermaritzburg.

""Look, we have communities where AIDS is actually leveling off because all our young, able-bodied people who are at risk of catching the bloody disease are now infected,"" Mckerrow said. ""It's that sort of horror that people can't seem to see squarely. All this other stuff is just looking away.""

At an anguished turn of the millennium for Africa, looking away is an oft-heard charge when it comes to battling the worst scourge to hit humanity since European microbes colonized America 500 years ago, wiping out millions of aboriginal people.

The sort of willful blindness that is afflicting the dying residents of Esidubwini, global health experts say, is common in capitals around the continent.

Uganda, which has reduced its AIDS infection rate through an aggressive public education and pro-condom campaign, is one of few notable exceptions.

""An enormous opportunity is being missed to mobilize women's groups, church groups, unions, whatever,"" said David Heymann, executive director of the communicable disease program for the World Health Organization in Geneva. ""What governments don't seem to understand is that the window of opportunity is closing and that if they don't tackle this gigantic problem now, they're just endangering their own survival.""

Africa's cash-strapped nations have been criticized for funding extravagant prestige projects that seem, at best, misguided in the plague years of AIDS.

Whether it's dams in Namibia or Japanese-funded, multimillion-dollar referral hospitals in Zambia, where rural clinics that service the majority of the population often don't even stock aspirin, the development priorities of many AIDS-sickened countries has been condemned by AIDS activists here and abroad.

South Africa, the rich man of sub-Saharan Africa yet a country with the fastest-growing AIDS infection rate in the world, hasn't escaped blame. It just signed a $3 billion contract to procure fighter jets, submarines and other weaponry from European arms makers at a time when its health budget is shrinking 5 percent.

'A major failure'
""This is a major failure of national will,"" said Charlene Smith, a journalist who became an AIDS campaigner after being raped this year in her home. One-third of all South African women who visit rape clinics test positive for HIV.

""About 75 percent of all pediatric deaths at Johannesburg General Hospital are related to AIDS these days,"" Smith said. ""Because nobody likes to use condoms in this country, we've also got countless families with both parents dead. We should be building orphanages, not buying guns.""

Yet, in fairness, many of the poor governments most affected by AIDS in Africa can't spend more on health and welfare, even if they wanted to. The virus is mowing down their people in the midst of economic belt-tightening programs urged on the by global lending agencies such as the World Bank.

Such ""economic restructuring"" is well-intentioned; it's a sour dose of medicine designed to cure inefficiency and slim down bloated governments. But in the AIDS-pummeled Africa of today, the free-market ways of a globalized economy can carry a heavy human cost.

In Zimbabwe, where 60 percent of all hospital beds are occupied by AIDS cases, thousands of nurses have left their jobs because of drastic pay cuts. And in Kenya, hopeful statistics that showed a decline in sexually transmitted diseases -- the best marker for the prevalence of AIDS -- turned out to be false: People had simply stopped going to clinics because they couldn't pay for formerly subsidized services.

""It never helps to have a major epidemic explode just as you're trying to reform public health systems,"" said David Allen, an American epidemiologist working with the South African Health Department.

Not that the people of the serene, beautiful and tormented communities of South Africa's Midlands would ever know. More than 90 percent of their residents die at home, perishing in utter poverty from a disease that, after all these years of killing, few still dare identify by name.

One recent afternoon, Shabane, the social worker, toured her home community of Mt. Elias, pointing out houses where people have died. There was the family where both parents had died; a 16-year-old daughter was taking care of her younger siblings. A few blocks away was Granny Lephina's house. She has lost all three of her children to ""tuberculosis"" and the cost of the funerals--about $450--had bankrupted her.

""Let's stop and see somebody who's dying,"" Shabane said with an angry smile.

Beauty Ngidi, 22, sat in her brother's home alone, a thin, slow-moving young woman who lived up to her name. The hut was in deep shadow.

""You know, you should admit you have this disease,"" Shabane said while Ngidi's family hovered warily outside, just beyond earshot.

Ngidi said nothing.

""Beauty, you really should,"" Shabane repeated softly."
53,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"The wind has no name. But it is a fierce wind, a bad wind, and when it blows down this tar-black jungle river, most people run. Because it turns their eyes the color of blood. Because the wind kills them.

Isidore Edjimouagno knows. He survived the evil wind, though it left him a broken man. This is his one claim to fame: He breathed the wind and lived. He is a dead man who sits blinking in surprise under the shade trees of his garden.

""People thought it was yellow fever at first and weren't that frightened,"" recalled Edjimouagno, 61, one of scores of gold panners who were brought down the Ivindo River in dugouts, vomiting blood and semiconscious. ""But the next time the wind came they all ran away. The police had to set up roadblocks in the towns. They wanted to run all the way to the capital.""

Edjimouagno's harrowing brush with the foul winds of the Ivindo River was the world's last recorded outbreak of ebola, Africa's notoriously lethal virus.

The fatal virus with the terrifying mystique has howled down the broad, silent river several times now, most recently in 1996-97, swiftly killing at least 100 people, or about 8 out of every 10 of its victims. As always, after burning through the local population, it subsided back into the jungle without a trace.

For all scientists can manage to decipher of ebola's natural history, it might as well be a mystical wind -- one that bodes poorly for the future health of this enfeebled continent, or, for that matter, given the ease of air travel, the world beyond.

As the new millennium begins, nothing -- not the collapse of creaky dictatorships, not the advent of Mandela in South Africa or McDonald's in Mauritius -- shapes the character of life in modern Africa more than deadly illness.

AIDS rakes the continent, taking such a horrific toll that diseases such as sleeping sickness, which threatens to kill 300,000 people, are considered silent epidemics. Hard-won, incremental health gains that had added a year or two to the average African's lifespan since the 1970s now lie in tatters. Disease, says the World Bank, remains the prime reason Africa still lags in the race of continents.

So it is ironic, then, that what gives the international community a case of cold sweats isn't so much Africa's mammoth epidemics -- AIDS, malaria or pulmonary infections, to name a few -- but instead the small ambushes being set by so-called new or emerging diseases that surface in the forests,pick off a few human beings and disappear in the epidemiological equivalent of a drive-by shooting.

Viruses such as ebola and Marburg liquefy the internal organs, causing some victims to bleed even from their pores. Neither has a cure, each is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids and can kill within days.

Gruesome as the diseases are, global health authorities are even more alarmed by the certainty that new, ebola-like scourges are on the way. The reason? As Africa's burgeoning population continues to push into tropical ecosystems -- farming, cutting down trees and grazing cattle where they never had before -- countless more people will blunder into the ancient webs of parasitism between unknown microbes and animals and thus become possible hosts themselves.

Consider the numbers. According to the United Nations, in 1950 only 224 million people lived in sub-Saharan Africa, a vast region larger than the United States, China and India combined. Today, that figure has almost tripled,to 650 million. By 2025, even under the killing weight of its epidemics,the number is expected to nearly double again, to 1 billion. The majority of these people are rural, and as such will remain in the cross hairs of strange, opportunistic diseases.

But if health authorities suffer nightmares about red-eyed ebola victims staggering into their airports -- as one was thought to have done in Augustin Berlin (it was yellow fever; he died) -- then rich nations share part of the blame.

Climate change sparked by fossil fuel use in industrialized countries is disrupting the tropical ecosystems of Africa and probably will unleash unpredictable new epidemics, experts warn. Malaria, a not-so-novel killer, already is marching south with unprecedented warm weather into parts of South Africa where it has never been seen.

Moreover, global commerce is playing a powerful role in opening up the Congo basin's gigantic, almost impenetrable forests to human settlement. International logging corporations have multiplied in the region since the mid-1960s, and in Gabon, where French corporations are active, the muddy roads that funnel out truckloads of tropical hardwoods destined for parquet flooring have brought out something less profitable -- people dying of ebola.

""Ebola is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Sally Lahm, an American ecologist and anthropologist doing fieldwork in the vast, sweltering Ivindo watershed in Gabon. ""Everybody in the West loves the idea of biodiversity in rain forests. Well, people forget that that includes microbes too.

""Look at it from the perspective of these viruses,"" said Lahm, who lives in the jungle trading town of Makokou. ""Look who's invading who.""

Whichever end of the microscope you view it from, it seems that even after a quarter-century of experience -- ebola came to light in then-Zaire in 1976 -- the human beings aren't doing so great.

In Africa's most recent outbreak of hemorrhagic fever, a Marburg epidemic in rebel-held Congo last year that reportedly killed 70 to 80 people, it took 10 months for scientists to identify the culprit.

The delay came despite an infusion of cash from nervous developed countries eager to monitor emerging killer diseases. This is one of the few elements of Africa's collapsed health system that has seen a boost in foreign funding recently, much of it courtesy of a $50 million donation by the U.S.

In the case of the 1995-97 ebola outbreaks in Gabon, where identification was brisker, public panic smashed through quarantine controls set up by at least three national and international disaster relief agencies.

Hundreds of terrified people from the remote hot zone near the Ivindo River drove, hitchhiked, flew or limped all the way to Libreville, the teeming Gabonese capital a 15-hour drive away. There, appalled friends and families slammed their doors in the refugees' faces out of fear of infection. The government admits to 11 of the quarantine escapees dying in the city.

Meanwhile, back in the jungle, the dying floated down the inky currents of the Ivindo in canoes. People rolled their bodies hurriedly into the water, or into shallow holes dug into the muddy river banks, propping beer bottles on sticks as grave markers. Their cherry-red eyes: That's what everyone remembers.

In river towns such as Makokou and Booue, disease experts from France and the World Health Organization trudged the muddy streets in spacesuits, embittering the local people.

""It was like our lives were worth nothing,"" said Alphonse Kuomissele, whose father, Isidore, was one of the few who survived being infected during the Gabon outbreaks. ""People would walk backward away from you, to make sure you wouldn't touch them. Taxis were afraid to stop. Even the police at the road blocks just waved you through because they didn't want to touch your identity card.""

To make matters worse, one man, a Gabonese doctor who had treated a dying ebola patient in Libreville, thoughtlessly rode an airliner all the way to Johannesburg, where he became sick within days. Dozens of people on the plane were exposed to the deadly virus. The South African nurse who treated him died.

""I sure wish somebody would find out where these diseases hide out in the forests when they're not out killing people,"" said Bob Swanepoel, a researcher at South Africa's National Institute of Virology and a world expert on ebola. ""It'd be a hell of a relief. We could all get on with our lives.""

Swanepoel, a sprightly, goateed man who has made a career of tramping to the far corners of Africa to identify new diseases, has collected hundreds of bat, rodent, primate, insect and plant samples from jungles, trying to pin down ebola's ""reservoir"" in nature.

A study released last summer by French researchers claiming to have finally isolated ebola DNA in shrews from the Central African Republic is not definitive, Swanepoel said.

""Is it in bushmeat? A monkey? Is it a mosquito bite? You can test 100,000 mosquitoes for a certain virus until you find it; that's the sort of job we face,"" he said. ""The fact is, there are already 500 known viruses, and we've only pegged 26 to disease. The unknown ones run into the tens of thousands. Africa is going to be keeping us busy for a while.""

Swanepoel was on the team that identified last year's Marburg outbreak in Congo. Named after the German city where it claimed the lives of several lab workers, Marburg hemorrhagic fever is, if anything, even more cryptic than ebola. It snuffed out scores of people in Durba, a rebel-held town where Canadian gold-mining operations had disturbed big swaths of rain forest.Miners were dropping dead in excrement-fouled tunnels, Swanepoel said, and their colleagues were working right atop the buried bodies. On hearing of the outbreak, neighboring Uganda slammed its border shut.

""Forget trying to stop these scary things' spread out of Africa,"" said David Heymann, the American executive director of the communicable disease program for the World Health Organization. ""If you're sitting in Podunk, Wisconsin, you're not safe from these infectious diseases. They go anywhere.""

International flight figures would seem to bear him out. According to the World Tourism Organization, the number of departures from Africa between 1993 and 1997 increased 44 percent, the second highest jump in the world after the Middle East.

Heymann added that 900 malaria cases are imported to the United States every year. West Nile virus, an exotic African disease with serious, encephalitis-like symptoms, made its first appearance in the Western hemisphere last year in New York, he noted.

""The mosquitoes that carry yellow fever and malaria are still all over the southeastern United States, just waiting to feast on an unvaccinated population,"" he said. ""It just makes economic sense to attack these problems at the source, in Africa, rather than here in our own back yards.""

He ticked off other emerging diseases in Africa -- less lethal ones than ebola or Marburg, perhaps, but incapacitating enough: Lassa fever (spread by rats), yellow fever (an urban disease), Rift Valley fever (a hemorrhgic fever spread by dam and irrigation projects).

""We can't rely on our little spacesuits to insulate us from Africa anymore,"" he said. ""With trade, travel, global investments, it just ain't that kind of world any longer.""

Africans, meanwhile, are more alone than ever in their struggle against the onslaught of cryptic new diseases, ailments that could prove to be the plagues of the 21st Century.

Over the gilded 1990s, a decade of economic boom times in America and Europe, black Africa's nations got poorer, part of a global trend toward the concentration of more wealth in fewer hands. The disparity of wealth between the world's richest and poorest countries, the United Nations says, yawned from a ratio of 44:1 in 1973 to 727:1 in 1997.

In the age of genetic therapies and miraculous baboon-to-human heart transplants, the governments of the world's sickest continent can afford to spend between $1 and $10 per citizen per year on health care. And about the only people getting rich in Africa these days are the muti men, the traditional healers who have a bonanza of misery to reap. One in South Africa has just bought a DC-3 airplane for his private airstrip.

""Our diseases are making us poorer not just in body but in spirit,"" said Pierre Kombila, the new minister of health in Gabon, an intense, bespectacled man of little ceremony who personally answers the door to his tiny government office in Libreville. ""Health is the first ingredient in pride. Today, alot of Gabonese hate being Gabonese.""

On the banks of the murky Ivindo River, in faraway Makokou, where hospital staffers are paid so wretchedly they have to moonlight -- one nurse operates a bar -- a health worker who survived the worst of ebola disasters knew what Kombila was saying.

She described bitterly how senior government officials had stolen thousands of dollars worth of medical supplies left after the outbreaks by foreign donors.

She recalled coldly how whites had showed up in their spacesuits days after she and her exhausted co-workers had been slipping through ebola-laced blood and diarrhea in their plastic sandals, trying frantically, without medicines, to save their dying neighbors from the deadliest pathogen known to mankind.

""All of that is disgraceful,"" she said. ""But I will do it again. That is my job. I'll do what I can with cotton balls and water.""

So she waits, with her barren dispensary shelves, to see what comes rolling next down the big dark river."
54,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"Like any other park warden in Africa, Klaus-Jurgen Sucker had enemies, although maybe more than most. When it came to defending his park's endangered mountain gorillas, Sucker knocked heads hard.

A strapping, 37-year-old German biologist, Sucker infuriated the local Bakiga and Bafumbira hunters whose snares he ripped up, some 7,000 wire traps in all. He earned the wrath of illegal loggers by erecting steel barriers along the park's boundaries. Five years of angry clashes with encroaching farmers had turned his mop of blond hair prematurely white --  much like the hulking, silver-backed gorillas he so admired.

Sucker's most formidable foes, however, came from far beyond Mgahinga's bamboo forests and watercolor-blue volcanoes.

In a backlash as old as African conservation itself, powerful interest groups objected to the warden's gung-ho methods.

Critics said that Sucker put the needs of animals above those of thousands of impoverished Africans living around his park. When Sucker refused to bend, they quietly lobbied the Ugandan National Parks Service for his transfer.

""Klaus was a strong man, but when they ordered him to go it affected his heart,"" said Sunday Nyakunze, an AK-47-toting park ranger trained by Sucker. ""That's the only way we can explain the bad thing he did at the end.""

Apparently distraught over abandoning his beloved gorillas, Sucker hanged himself in his nearby village home without leaving a note.

Sucker's obscure 1994 death might seem like just another case of environmental martyrdom in Africa; inevitably, his tragedy has been compared to the murder of Dian Fossey of ""Gorillas in the Mist"" fame.

But Sucker's story is different, because his most powerful opponents weren't the usual rogue's gallery of xenophobic politicians or greedy wildlife dealers, but competing environmentalists who have launched what is, in effect, a sweeping, last-ditch battle for the soul of wild Africa.

Organizations such as the International Gorilla Conservation Program, the World Bank and CARE have chosen the misty jungles and crowded villages of southwestern Uganda as a vast and controversial testing ground for the theory of ""community conservation."" The idea is simple: To save what's left of Africa's fading wildlife, experts say, the animals must in essence be given back to the Africans, so the Africans will feel more of a kinship with them and feel the need to protect them.

Lucrative gorilla tourism profits, for example, are being shunted toward building local schools. Villagers who were once evicted from the gorilla parks are being invitedback in to harvest forest products, a heresy unthinkable in Sucker's day. And dozens of technical consultants, wheeling their shiny four-wheel-drive vehicles through the farmlands that ring gorilla habitat, are pushing million-dollar projects in crop improvement, family planning, agro forestry and micro-enterprise-- all to minimize human conflict with some 300 reclusive apes.

Remote, hauntingly beautiful and dirt poor, Uganda's version of Appalachia has thus become the world's boldest experiment in social engineering for the sake of the environment. It is a corner of Africa where pygmies are now required to carry ""utilization permits"" to use their own forests. Where the gorillas' long-term fortunes depend on the vagaries of the London stock exchange. And where a gentler, kinder vision of conservation, advocates say, might rescue a continent's wildlife from an otherwise bleak future.

""Sucker would never compromise for his gorillas,"" said Jaap Schoorl, a Dutch environmental consultant who worked in Uganda when the German was still booting villagers out of Mgahinga. ""But we have to face the reality that Africa's wild places are shrinking islands surrounded by a growing sea of people. Unless we do something drastic, we're lost.""

Few experts dispute the fact that Africa's pageant of wildlife is in drastic shape. After more than a century of Western-style management, the iconic animals that have come to symbolize wild nature to millions of people around the world are more threatened than ever. Fabled wildlife parks have become dog-eared meccas of industrial tourism. And biologists warn that the Earth's richest assemblage of large mammals -- a unique remnant of the fauna that roamed the continents during the Pleistocene Epoch -- is slipping inexorably toward oblivion.

Consider these trends:

With Africa's human population expected to rocket from 650 million to 1.1 billion over the next 25 years, hundreds if not thousands of animal and plant species will be crowded out of existence. The biggest fight ahead, conservationists say,won't be on Africa's famed savannas, but in besieged forests like those at Mgahinga and its sister gorilla park, the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Today, efforts are under way to safeguard small patches of the species-rich Congo Basin, a vast rain forest a third the size of the continental United States that is under assault by European logging firms.
The environmental coups scored against the international wildlife trade in the 1990s -- particularly the ivory ban that helped save Africa's elephants -- are being undone bynew, homegrown threats. Urban migration of rural people has created a faddish appetite for wild animal meat among Africa's millions of city dwellers. This bush-meat trade has funneled tons of dead antelopes, elephants, bush pigs, monkeys and snakes -- trussed in bloody burlap sacks -- into the booming city markets of central and West Africa every year.
Africa's latest cycle of wars, meanwhile, is gutting the continent's premier wildlife habitats. The Congo's Virunga National Park, a UN-designated World Heritage Site where Africa's oldest rain forests grow, has turned into a killing zone for animals. Armed factions in Congo's civil war have gunned down 10,000 hippos, 6,000 buffaloes and more than 3,000 elephants since 1994, biologists say. Desperate refugees have razed more than 20 square miles of the forest for firewood.
Yet the most disturbing trend of all, experts warn, is that Africa's wildlife is becoming increasingly irrelevant to Africans themselves. Swelling armies of rural peasants seewild animals as little more than crop pests -- or dinner. And among the continent's exploding urban populations, the plight of such animals as black rhinos, whose numbers have crashed disastrously from 100,000 to just 3,000 in 25 years, is an eccentric concern at best.

""The average American or European has seen more African species in zoos than your typical modern African has seen in the wild,"" said Elias Maluleke, a South African journalist who has written on the subject. ""Wildlife parks are seen as white peoples' enclaves. How many blacks do you see wandering around Kruger National Park (in South Africa)? How many big game hunters are black? Africans get nothing out of their own wildlife.""

Which is exactly where community-based conservation comes in.

Pioneered in Zimbabwe in the 1980s, supporters of the concept insist that Africa's wildlife will never survive without the help of rural communities, where almost 80 percent of all Africans still live. Instead of rousting villagers from parks, the thinking goes, Africa's wardens should be seeking ways to get them back in, if only to instill a sense of connection with protected areas. Economic links between people and animals should be bolstered through ecotourism. And where that fails, then other opportunities must be concocted to enlist villagers to the cause of conservation.

Nowhere does hope blaze more brightly for this new hearts-and-minds approach than at Mgahinga and Bwindi national parks in Uganda. At stake, experts say, is far more than half the world's remaining population of mountain gorillas. Mgahinga and nearby Bwindi, which together cover 144 square miles of gorilla habitat, encompass some of the richest ecosystems in Africa.

In Bwindi, a relict Ice Age forest, thousands of species of birds, mammals and insects swarm beneath the jungle canopy. And 15 miles away, at Mgahinga, where volcanoes jab above the Great Rift Valley, a rare, high-altitude patch of tundra thrives only 100 miles away from the equator.

In satellite photos, both parks appear as small, forested islands with hard, ruler-straight shorelines. An estimated 100,000 farmers hoe their potato fields right up to their boundaries. In places, crowding at the edges of the parks surpasses 900 people per square mile. In the United States, the average population density hovers around75.

For Jackson Mutebi, a biologist with CARE's Development Through Conservation program, that image from orbit offers a bleak snapshot of the future of protected areas in Africa.

""The rich world wants places like Mgahinga preserved, and they usually get their way, but it's always at the expense of the people who live here,"" said Mutebi. ""When these places became parks in the early 1990s, thousands of villagers lost access to firewood, building materials, food and medicinal plants overnight. They were so mad they were ready to hunt gorillas out of revenge. Our job is to try and find ways to compensate their losses.""

Sitting on a rock fence marking Mgahinga's boundary, he was overseeing a project that was doing just that. Dozens of local workmen were putting the finishing touches on a gigantic water tank. The metal cistern, paid for by the United Nations, eventually will supply 36,000 nearby villagers with tap water. The water is being piped from a wetland inside the park. Prime gorilla habitat.

Such trade-offs, of course, are exactly what outraged Karl-Jurgen Sucker, Mgahinga's bulldog warden. Not unexpectedly, his own water policies were more proactive.

""He would confiscate our plastic jugs if he caught us stealing water from the park,"" said John Mikekemo, a beekeeper from the tiny community of Buzeyi, which abuts the reserve. ""Sometimes he even burned our buckets.""

CARE's piped-water system, a powerful goodwill gesture, is just one of countless community conservation schemes designed to reverse that antagonistic relationship. The sheer scale of the effort -- funded by donors as diverse as the European Union, USAID, the Dutch government, the World Bank and private environmental groups --resembles an ecological Marshall Plan. Inevitably, it is reshaping the lives of thousands of rural Ugandans.

Mikekemo's small village of Buzeyi, with its bamboo granary and wheat-stalk thatched roofs, is as good an example as any of what Africans from the red deserts of Namibia to the wildlife-rich swamps of Cameroon can look forward to with the rise of ""benefit sharing"" conservation across the continent.

Agricultural experts have quadrupled Buyezi's bean crop output, partly to lift families out of survival mode so they can begin to think about conservation, but also to reduce pressure for opening up new land. (Other villages have been encouraged to take up goat farming to replace the antelopes once hunted in the parks.)

Moreover, beekeepers such as Mikekemo will soon be allowed to place their hives inside park boundaries as part of a ""multiple use"" program. In villages around Bwindi, people are already gathering bamboo, clay, medicinal plants and basketry vines inside the park, albeit on a controlled basis.

The most important benefits by far, however, are reaped from the elusive mountain gorillas themselves.

Gorilla groups habituated to the presence of tourists have churned out millions of dollars for the Ugandan government. As much as 70 percent of the Ugandan Wildlife Authority's budget comes from the $250-a-head gorilla trekking fees. Those revenues evaporated last spring after a Rwandan rebel attack killed eight tourists. But gorilla-lovers are slowly returning, and the world's largestapes, whose gentle demeanor has proven irresistible to tourists, already have generated funding for sixprimary schools around Mgahinga.

Such perks will never compensate for the land and resources locked up by the parks, of course. More than 1,000 people were expelled from Mgahinga in 1992 when a further 3 1/2 square miles of encroached-on habitat was reclaimed for the gorillas. Some of those hardest hit have been the minority Batwas, or Pygmies, who traditionally relied on the park's forests for their livelihoods.

""We once had all the food we could eat from the forest,"" said Ventina Nyirasafari, a grizzled matriarch who lives with her children and grandchildren within paces of Mgahinga's boundary wall. ""Now this park hurts us. It makes us poor.""

Nyirasafari was baffled by the requirement for a ""resource user's identity card"" to enter the forests of her ancestors.

""Who are thesepeople who come to tell us this?"" she asked bitterly, squatting in the black volcanic mud by her leaf hut, where a child lay glassy-eyed in fever.

CARE and othergroups have a ready reply: With unrestricted use, the gorilla parks would be plowed into farmland within 20 years' time.

Yet for all its laudable goals, some wildlife experts share Nyirasafari's doubts about the complex mesh of development and conservation projects swirling around Bwindi and Mgahinga.

To some, the projects' sheer size smacks of eco-colonialism, a foreign-devised social order that, ironically, espouses African empowerment.

""These gorillas tend to do things to donors' heads, so you've got this uncoordinated suite of organizations throwing bagfuls of money around down there,"" said Gilbert ""Robbie"" Robinson, the new director of the Uganda Wildlife Authority, which has itself been rattled by corruption scandals stemming from lucrative gorilla revenues.

""It's all hideously expensive and can't be sustained,"" Robinson said. ""When the money dries up, it will come crashing down.""

Indeed, nobodyis rallying to spend CARE's annual gorilla conservation budget of $820,000on African wild dogs, a wide-roaming species whose disappearance signals the end of unfragmented habitats on the continent. No community conservation programs exist for the uncharismatic but endangered riverine rabbit. Or fo rthe vanishing desert warthog of Somalia. Or for many of the other 842 endangered species across the continent.

Yet, amazingly, the planners at Mgahinga and Bwindi foresaw even this problem. The WorldBank has stepped in to create the world's first trust fund for an endangered species. Dividends from a $4.3 million offshore fund will help finance Uganda's gorilla parks in perpetuity. A stock analyst in the dog-eared town of Kabaletracks the gorilla's stocks and bonds daily on the Web site of the London Stock Exchange; her office overlooks a dusty main street clogged with broad-horned ankole cattle and vendors with 50-pound bunches of bananas balanced on theirheads.

Still, even the wildest optimists in southwest Uganda concede that the ultimate clash over the future of Africa's wildlife won't likely be between law-enforcement types like Sucker and people-friendly pragmatists like Mutebi. Instead, it will be a chronic struggle for survival against the continent's notorious instability.

Across Mgahinga's misty volcanoes, Rwanda's premier gorilla ecotourism program lies in the rubble of that country's 1994 genocide. And a few miles to the east, an almost identical community-based project to save the other half of the gorilla population has been gutted by Congo's civil war.

A recent trip to that region revealed a spooky, derelict national park that has doubled as a human battlefield for nearly two years.

Rebel authorities have hacked down the Virunga National Park's 50 million-year-old forests to create free-fire zones along roads. Rumangabo, the once-gracious colonial park headquarters, has been looted bare. Soldiers even carted off the park's scientific library, one of the finest in Africa. And estimates of gorillas killed in the crossfire range as high as 25, a tenth of the local population.

""My rangers used to lead tourists from all over the world up these volcanoes, just like in Mgahinga,"" said Mesi Muhindo, Virunga's beleaguered conservator. Wistfully, Muhindo recounted how, until recently, gorilla trekkers could even drink French champagne in a tidy, chalet-style lodge.

""We are regressing,"" Muhindo said in his echoing headquarters, where the only items remaining are a few old specimen jars of age-bleached salamanders and snakes, leftover from Belgian colonial times. ""My rangers have had to turn into soldiers. Nine of them have been killed.""

Klaus-Jurgen Sucker would probably have understood.

Back in peaceful Mgahinga, the Ugandan park rangers who knew the combative warden have kept a monument to remember him by. It is one of the steel barriers the gorilla-obsessed German erected to keep people away from the animals. Over taken by shifting park borders, it now stands pointlessly on a grassy volcanic slope, holding nothing at bay."
55,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"In the steamy twilight of the jungle, Gilles Bokande hunkered beside a mossy stump and pinched his nose between his index and middle fingers. Blowing air through the back of his throat, he bleated like a duiker, a tiny forest antelope.

Nothing happened.

Trudging a mile deeper into Africa's largest remaining rain forest, Bokande crouched and tried again. Still no response.

The animals don't come anymore when Bokande, a Baka Pygmy, calls them. A fresh logging road snakes nearby--a muddy funnel that siphons away not only the forest's primeval hardwoods but also thousands of wild animals poached for the dinner tables of urbanites in the burgeoning cities of Cameroon.

""It's harder to find antelope, gorillas, chimpanzees and elephants,"" said Bokande, a pleasant, wiry man whose teeth are filed to sharp little points. ""The forest is getting quieter now.""

Across Africa, a remorseless silence is falling over the far untamed corners of a continent that long has symbolized wild nature to a jaded, over-industrialized world.

In places such as the famed gorilla reserves of Uganda, where conservationists are desperately trying to link the needs of dwindling wildlife with those of land-hungry farmers, it is the silence of nature drowned out by the babble of human overpopulation. In countries such as Kenya and South Africa--which grimly lead the continent with 59 and 141 endangered species--it is the quiet absence of wild animals outside of zoolike national parks. And in hot spots like Angola and Congo, it is the pitiable hush that comes after the massacres of wild animals amid terrible civil wars.

But here, deep in the lush rain forests of central Africa, that deadened stillness is even more ominous because it heralds the outside world's final assault on the last true wilderness left on the continent. In a rain forest second only to the Amazon in size, environmentalists are girding themselves for one of the defining conservation battles of the 21st Century: saving an African frontier so wild that its animals don't run away because they have never seen humans before.

""This is the holy of holies,"" said World Wildlife Fund biologist Paul Noupa, one of the conservationists scrambling to set up wildlife sanctuaries so remote that they probably won't have visitors for years. ""If we fail to preserve this place, we can only blame ourselves. All over Africa, you have a long history of conservation. Not here. Here we are starting from scratch, and the clock is ticking.""

Until recently, time was of little consequence in the vast rain forest that stretches from Nigeria east to Rwanda.

About a third as big as the continental United States, it was a forgotten refuge for Africa's densest concentrations of animals and for the Pygmies who hunted them with arrows and spears. But since the early 1990s, a timber rush spearheaded by European logging companies has kicked off a classic story of greed and exploitation--a tale that includes an unprecedented slaughter of monkeys, an unseemly turf battle among conservation groups, and a cynical developed world that wants to have its rain forest and eat it too.

Logging and hunting have gone hand in sweaty hand in the Congo Basin for as long as anyone can remember. But both activities have exploded for reasons few could have foreseen.

The depletion of west Africa's forests, where Europe traditionally bought its tropical hardwoods, has launched a stampede of French, German and Middle Eastern logging companies into the more inaccessible jungles of central Africa. At the same time, a regional economic crisis has only accelerated the timber boom: Local currency devaluations in the mid-1990s effectively halved the cost of hauling 800-year-old trees through hundreds of miles of forest to the parquet-flooring and furniture-making markets of Europe and Japan.

In Cameroon, wood production soared 50 percent between 1992 and 1997, the last years for which figures are available.

Strapped for cash because of slumping cacao exports, the government has gratefully seized the $60 million-a-year lifeline created by logging revenues. The story is the same in neighboring Gabon, where declining oil production is stoking the logging trade and where the president, Omar Bongo, owns 500,000 acres of prime timber concessions.

But just as Mercedes-Benz logging trucks have begun rumbling in earnest along the Congo Basin's new mud highways, the public's appetite for wild animal meat surged in the teeming cities of Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and the Central African Republic.

Elephants, antelopes and monkeys have been a staple of local villagers' diets for millenniums, of course. But Africa's swelling urban populations, nostalgic for village foods and flush with money, have turned a subsistence activity into a burgeoning, multimillion-dollar industry.

Newly extended logging roads have become bush meat pipelines plied by poachers who snare and shoot anything in sight. Many logging companies encourage the hunting because it also saves on the cost of shipping beef into the remote jungle towns where their workers live.

""We know it's a problem, and we are even planning to raise a herd of cows for workers to eat,"" said Thibaut Fuchs, the sawmill manager of the Forestry Association of Cameroon, a French-Cameroonian logging company that selectively harvests mahogany, sapeli and ebony from 200,000 acres of jungle. ""But it's an uphill battle. People here say, 'You've got to be kidding! Why raise cows? The forest is ours, and the wild animals are everywhere!' ""

In hundreds of town markets like the one in Yokadouma, a logging center set like a grubby island in the middle of southeastern Cameroon's oceanic canopy of trees, about a dozen vendors specialize in selling wild animal carcasses. Antelopes, skinned and trussed, look like small greyhounds frozen in mid-stride. Elephant meat is hacked into 2-pound cubes. And smoked sections of an animal's large intestine--possibly from a forest buffalo--look like a charred fire hose.

""The bush meat trade is the No. 1 threat to biodiversity in the Congo Basin,"" said Conrad Aveling, director of ECOFAC, a European-funded environmental group based in Gabon. ""A logging road goes in, and five years later there isn't a single large animal left in the forests. Thousands of square kilometers have been hunted clean. We're talking about tons and tons of animal meat, including organized shipments that go across the borders of Gabon and Cameroon.""

Hit especially hard, environmentalists say, is the Congo Basin's rich diversity of primates. Monkey meat is prized as a status food among urban elites. Endangered gorillas can bring $100 on the wild-meat market. A chimpanzee nets almost as much. Experts warn that only about 120,000 common chimpanzees are left in central Africa's rain forests, and thousands are shot every year.

""It's not much of a sport, because parts of this forest are so remote that the animals just sit there when they see you--they don't know to be afraid,"" said Henk Hoefsloot, a WWF biologist based in Yokadouma. ""Not even the Pygmies go into some parts of the jungle. This is the Africa not of a hundred years ago, but before the presence of human beings.""

That extraordinary isolation is what ultimately lies on the chopping block of the loggers and poachers, experts say. In the utterly remote rain forest where the borders of Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic converge, enormously diverse animal and plant populations have been buffered from outside disturbance since before the last Ice Age.

And unlike the more famous Amazon, the Congo Basin bustles with large animals. Elephant populations are far higher here than in Africa's celebrated savannas. Moreover, a unique system of jungle clearings, called bais, functions as a remarkable magnet for wildlife.

""These are the animals' gardens, where they all come to eat,"" said biologist Noupa, who has done surveys for the WWF in Cameroon's southeastern hinterland. ""You look at them, and they seem like uniform little patches of grassland. But we've counted 110 species of grass in one.""

The conservation community's campaigns to save this pristine, wild heart of Africa have been intense--and illuminate the enormous power that global environmentalism wields at the turn of the millennium, but also its uglier iniquities.

Prodded by global conservation groups, the European Union and World Bank in August convened a meeting with Cameroonian officials to read them the riot act. Unless Cameroon got serious about cracking down on the devastating bush meat trade, the foreigners warned, further development funds would be frozen. Specifically at stake was $52 million in EU money for road maintenance, a substantial sum in a country with a per capita annual income of $2,000.

Cameroon's nationalistic newspapers were not alone in seeing the irony in the threat.

""Here you have the developed world telling this poor country to shape up, while its own logging companies are the very ones opening up the forests to poaching,"" said Jaap Schoorl, the Cameroon field coordinator for the WWF, the world's largest environmental organization. ""It seems we still haven't outgrown the old double standard.""

Cynical or not, the fear of sanctions has stamped out the most blatant signs of the bush meat trade in Cameroon, where the problem is rampant. A huge bush meat market near the presidential palace in Yaounde, the capital, has been shut down. And the sale of endangered species, such as gorillas and chimps, has been forced underground.

Even so, the resources and the will to stop the hunting do not exist, especially in a country recently rated the most corrupt in the world by Transparency International, an organization that promotes economic accountability.

A recent anti-poaching patrol by Cameroon's Ministry of Environment and Forestry in Yokadouma, the logging town, drove home that point.

Chief ranger Mboh Dandjouma, a grave man clad in khakis and red penny loafers, had to borrow a truck from a German development organization to set up his surprise roadblocks on a logging road outside town. Within minutes, he stopped a bush taxi and confiscated a set of pathetically small elephant tusks, a pile of duiker antelopes and a bloody burlap sack filled with gut-shot monkeys: two mustached guenons, a spot-nosed guenon and a cloaked mangabey. The woman who carried the monkeys turned out to be the wife of a provincial member of parliament.

The next bust, of a rickety bus, bagged more dead antelopes and monkeys. The passengers, clearly shocked at the novelty of having their bush meat confiscated, screamed abuse at Dandjouma and his rangers.

""They threatened to kill us,"" Dandjouma said with a sigh afterward, beads of sweat bulging on his forehead.

He later explained that he and his 22 men are responsible for patrolling 12,000 square miles of forest, an area about the size of Maryland. Dead monkeys, their long tails tied around their necks to make convenient handles, hang for sale along all the roads around Yokadouma.

If the stick of international sanctions is failing to stanch the slaughter in the Congo Basin, conservationists are using carrots as well: With promises of World Bank biodiversity funding and the distant lure of ecotourism profits, conservation groups have triggered the biggest parkmaking rush Africa has seen since colonial times.

In Cameroon, the WWF is proposing three huge reserves that encompass 3,200 square miles of virgin rain forest, a region almost as big as Yellowstone National Park. Across the border in the Republic of Congo, the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society has spearheaded the creation of the 1,500-square-mile Nouabale-Ndoki National Park. And ECOFAC and others are either announcing new parks or reviving old ones in Congo, Gabon and the Central African Republic.

Privately, some of the wildlife biologists involved admit that a fierce game of public-relations one-upmanship--rooted in competition for donor funding--has marred the race to conserve Africa's last true wilderness.

""There's a lot of talk that goes into thin air,"" said a foreign park planner in Cameroon. ""We don't cooperate, we don't even talk to each other, and a lot of effort gets duplicated.""

Others have criticized the proliferation of ""paper parks"" as detrimental to the conservation effort in the Congo Basin. Such ""protected areas,"" announced with fanfare, get no institutional backing, slip into oblivion and end up eroding the credibility of all parks in the region. In a recent internal memo, the WWF even concedes as much: ""There is presently no viable institution in place to manage the newly created Forest Parks. . . . the human and financial resources that the Government of Cameroon will be able to avail for their management is factually non-existent.""

Nevertheless, many conservationists, gazing out over the primeval rain forests where animals still do not fear human beings, see no other choice.

""If these areas don't have legal status--pfft!--10 years from now, with a new government, you'll have a logging concession,"" said the WWF's Schoorl. ""This is humbling work. The truth is, we will never keep it all pristine. Not even a sizable fraction. Not unless we all go back to being Pygmies.""

Which in today's Africa, even Pygmies cannot do.

On the side of a logging road churned into the consistency and color of orange pudding, Basile Simba said his people can no longer find elephants nearby. This is a problem because Jengi, the forest spirit that protects the Baka Pygmies, must be placated with elephant kills.

""Without kills, we cannot dance, and Jengi has gone away,"" said Simba, whose clan has turned into one of the tendrils of the great, branching pipeline of bush meat feeding Cameroon's cities.

Simba said he wanted more logging roads, so he and his hunters could find elephants. The thing he wants most in the world, he said, is a shotgun."
56,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"This rocket-shattered village on the desolate plains of northern Angola doesn't look like the front line of an ugly new kind of war in Africa.

Everything seems too dismally familiar. The abandoned mud huts. The government troops trudging down red-dirt savanna roads with looted furniture balanced on their heads. The filthy refugees with sunken eyes who watch them pass from the shade of mango trees.

Squint, and Cangandala could be any African war zone within the last 50 years. Except for the stories of exhausted old men such as Paciencia Nyanga.

""When the soldiers chased us off our farm they said it was for our own safety, because of the guerrillas,"" said Nyanga, 60, a soba, or traditional village elder who led his family across 60 miles of wilderness to the relative safety of a refugee camp here. ""But we know better. There were mines nearby. They were too close to us. We knew they were dangerous.""

Nyanga wasn't referring Angola's lethal crop of 10 million land mines. He was talking about diamond mines, and here his woes, like the seemingly familiar wretchedness of Cangandala, symbolize a new and particularly venal chapter in the history of warfare on this continent.

In a conflict that every year seems less like a civil war and more like an exceedingly violent corporate takeover, government generals have seized Nyanga's land not because of his politics, tribal affiliation or religion, but simply to mine whatever gems might lie under the old man's cornfields. For years, UNITA rebels have been doing exactly the same thing, and the millions that both armies skim from such dirty business not only buys more tanks and ammunition, but perks such as private jets, luxury cars, vacations in Europe, fat overseas bank accounts and, for government officers at least, investments in tacky discos in the mildewed capital of Luanda.

More than just diamonds are at stake in this greedy free-for-all. Angola's war booty includes a vast pool of offshore oil, much of it pumped by American petroleum giants such as Chevron. That bonanza in turn feeds an even greater web of corruption and profiteering that entangles everyone from the political clique surrounding Angola's president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, to Slovakian arms dealers, South African pilots and Israeli radar manufacturers.

In effect, after 25 years of grinding combat and a pile of 500,000 dead, Angola has metamorphosed from an idealistic liberation war to a Cold War sideshow to a post-modern killing field. Stripped of nationalism or ideology, the fighting here today is little more than armed capitalism.

""It's one of the continent's new commercial wars,"" said Simon Taylor, an analyst with Global Witness, a London-based human-rights watchdog. ""The government and UNITA wrap themselves in democracy, freedom and human rights, but they're just lining their pockets.

""When you think about it, what's happening in Angola isn't so much a new war as a very old one,"" Taylor added.

""We're actually regressing back to a colonial-style scramble for Africa's natural resources. Only now it's the multinational conglomerates and local political elites who are cashing in.""

More traditional forms of mass bloodletting haven't entirely vanished from Africa, where 11 wars are simmering. Thousands of Tutsis and Hutus, for example, still are being hacked or shot to death in the grim ethnic strife tormenting Burundi and Rwanda. Religious antagonism between Muslims and Christians plays a toxic part in the civil war in Sudan. In Africa's parched Horn, neighbors Eritrea and Ethiopia have waged a bizarre territorial conflict over a patch of worthless desert.

But the troubling rise of apolitical, money-driven wars in Africa is hard to ignore in the continent's most recent hot spots. In Sierra Leone's revolution by amputation, diamonds are again at the core of the fighting. Oil wealth drives the ongoing unrest in the Republic of Congo. In Congo, formerly Zaire, by far Africa's most explosive conflict, six different nations are mired in an ideology-free combat where the stakes boil down to access to natural resources as diverse as gold, timber, diamonds and coffee.

When it come to killing for profit, however, Angola remains in a class by itself.

After achieving independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola's fractured liberation movement was quickly hijacked by the Cold War machinations of East and West. The former Soviet Union supported the leftist MPLA government of dos Santos, while the rebel UNITA movement, led by the veteran guerrilla Jonas Savimbi, received millions in armaments from the CIA and the old white-supremacist regime in South Africa.

Unfortunately, since the fall of Berlin Wall, extinguishing the flames of the bloody if forgotten war in Angola's savannas and deserts has proven far more difficult than fanning them.

UNITA's Savimbi, a die-hard opportunist, seems willing to spill blood until he is crowned Angola's supremo. After stubbornly sabotaging every peace effort sponsored by the United Nations over the last decade, including a 1992 election that he lost, the onetime hero of the Reagan administration has become an international pariah. The West now backs former leftist dos Santos, whose newly found enthusiasm for free markets has earned him a reputation as one of the most corrupt presidents in Africa.

What all this means for 11 million ordinary Angolans is a rudderless war with no end in sight, a conflict that has reduced three quarters of the population to slat-ribbed poverty.

Luanda, a once-charming coastal city of red-tiled roofs, boasted 3,000 members in its yacht club during colonial times. Today, about the only vessels plying its harbor are cargo ships carrying UN corn for some 1.2 million war refugees.

Thousands of unemployed youths hawk Portuguese wine, wild parrots, toilet seats and condoms in Luanda's streets.

Around them clashes the surreal iconography of Angola's endless war, old and new. Chevron's gleaming headquarters, for example, sits on Lenin Avenue. DHL, the American express-mail company, is located on Comandante Che Street.

The country's Marxist-turned-capitalist political elite, meanwhile, gun their sport-utility vehicles through the chaos, nudging aside los mutilados, beggars who press their mine-blasted stumps against rolled-up car windows.

""It's fashionable to say that we are cursed by our mineral riches,"" said Rafael Marques, an Angolan journalist who was convicted of libel and sentenced to 6 months in jail for attacking corruption in the dos Santos regime.

""That's not true. We are cursed by our leaders. Dos Santos and Savimbi are exactly the same because they are killing us for money. They are our CEOs of war.""

Yet if Angola's war has degenerated into a soulless business venture, then it is impossible not to tally its assets. Angola, where a third of the children are dying of disease and hunger before the age of 5, is potentially one of the richest nations in the world.

Enormous new oil strikes have placed the country's petroleum reserves on par with Europe's North Sea, say industry experts. Last year alone, exploration bonuses shelled out by American and French conglomerates earned the Angolan government $800 million, almost all of which was spent on weaponry. The U.S. pumps 7 percent of all its imported crude from Angola, most of it through Chevron wells. Oil analysts say that figure will double within the next decade.

""Billions in oil revenues pour into a black hole called the Angolan government, and most of it is never seen again,"" said Taylor of Global Witness. ""Dos Santos' cronies funnel it through their own supply companies and take kickbacks on every bullet fired in the war, on every uniform, on every piece of bread fed to the soldiers. War has been very kind to these people, and there is little incentive to stop it.""

In a report issued last year on the role of oil in Angola's conflict, Global Witness accused the president's arms procurers of using this gusher of petroleum dollars to buy Slovakian arms through the Russian mob. Israeli, Ukrainian and Russian arms dealers also are believed to be tapping the profits from Angola's oil.

When it comes to the commerce of war, some Angolan officials are loath to turn any client away. According to the New York-based group Human Rights Watch, aircraft belonging to Sonangol, the national oil company, even have been sighted at enemy UNITA airstrips.

Through its spokesman at the Ministry of Social Communication, the Angolan government refused to comment on those allegations.

So did Chevron, which funnels hundreds of millions in taxes every year into Luanda's murky coffers. So crucial are Chevron's revenues, in fact, that they have spawned one of the more legendary anecdotes of Angola's postmodern war: The American company's facilities were protected in the 1980s by Cuban troops, forces sent to prop up dos Santos' regime against attacks by American-funded rebels.

""Look, we can either engage the Angolans and try to change the system or just wash our hands of the place,"" said a U.S. official familiar with the scramble for lucre in Angola.

""I don't think that anyone disputes the fact that today the government is more responsible than Savimbi.""

Besides the fact that Luanda adheres to UN peace plans, however, little of substance differentiates the two old enemies anymore -- except their sources of income.

For Savimbi, it is Angola's incomparable treasure trove of diamonds. On average, only 15 percent of the world's diamonds are gem-quality, experts say. In Angola, that percentage rockets to an extraordinarily profitable 80 percent.

Varied sources say that Savimbi has amassed $3 billion to $4 billion in illicit gemstone sales over the last eight years, despite UN trade sanctions against his rebels. In a blunt UN investigation published two weeks ago, Belgian diamond brokers, Bulgarian arms dealers and several African heads of state were all implicated in UNITA's diamond smuggling ring.

""They'll never be able to stop it,"" said a government diamond broker in Malange, a northern city that was shelled mercilessly by UNITA forces last year, after the latest cease-fire unraveled.

""There's too much money to be made in this war, and both sides know it,"" said the man, who asked to remain anonymous. ""Peace means we'll have to clean up our books. Nobody wants that.""

Sitting at an open-air bar in Malange and watching the army roll into the shattered town to unload truckloads of beer, the broker told how he had bought gems from his government's enemy. A small plane touches down at a dirt airstrip. A waiting UNITA officer takes the requisite 15 percent cut from a briefcase stuffed with $1 million. And the remaining capital goes for locally mined stones that are then mixed with other gems before being sold in Antwerp, Belgium.

Such tales of an undeclared ""diamond detente"" are like land mines in Angola; it is hard not to bump into them. Until recently, the two armies responsible for killing a half-million of their own citizens even were mining side by side along northeastern Angola's remote Chicapa River.

Efforts by Luanda to sift ""guerrilla-tainted diamonds"" out of its legitimate trade by creating a central clearing house called ASCORP, a firm again linked to dos Santos' cronies, have been greeted with skepticism.

""I think every diamond from Angola is dirty, not something you would want to wear,"" said Chris Dietrich, an Angola expert with South Africa's Institute for Security Studies. ""Just ask the average Angolan what this war is about. Nobody even remembers. It's about greed, period.""

Most of the war-weary, displaced farmers in bullet-pocked Cangandala village agreed, if in simpler terms. For them, as for old Nyanga, who had walked days across the savanna, the war was what they had lost: a herd of goats, their fields, a foot to an anti-personnel mine. Only one refugee recalled the antique Marxist rhetoric of dos Santos' MPLA government, a decade out of date.

""This is depressing because, in a sense, we're working for the generals too,"" said Hans Vikoler, an Italian with the UN World Food Program, which was feeding thousands of homeless people stranded in the village. ""The two sides move villagers off their lands to dig diamonds and we take care of them. We make business easier.""

In the end, about the only true believer seemed to be Flavio Fernandez, the governor of Malange, the vast and desolate province that encompasses Cangandala.

""We cannot give up the dream of democracy here,"" said Fernandez, who predicted that recent months of government victories were bringing UNITA and Savimbi to their knees. ""To say there are no ideals behind this war, no good or evil side, is lie. We are not fighting a lie.""

Fernandez, a close associate of the president, said this in his air-conditioned Luanda office, where the business cards on his desk introduced him as the president of a construction firm, the owner of Angola's sole Nissan dealership and director of a gynecological clinic.

No cards mentioned his post as governor of distant Malange province, perhaps because he spends no time there.

His office in Malange is a decrepit, shrapnel-spattered building with no power, where his staff hawks diamonds.

They display them to visitors with a whisper, and the stones look like salt."
57,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"A cloudless desert sky, shimmering like polished chrome. A desolate plain, littered with stones, unfolding to all horizons. A vast and ancient stillness. And in this wilderness of dust, the tiny footprints of a child.

""Himba,"" said Alfredo Tchimbuembue, a ranger sweating along a remote trail in Iona National Park, one of war-weary Angola's derelict nature reserves.

Tchimbuembue crouched to touch the print, shaking his head in wonder.

""They travel alone for days, herding goats,"" he said. ""They need nothing. They don't need us.""

Tchimbuembue would know. Trekking through his sprawling park only a few hours earlier, he had stumbled across a band of tough, proud Himba nomads who had never met an Angolan government official, despite having roots in the parched landscape that stretched back 400 years.

One bearded elder, smeared in red ochre pigment and puffing on an antelope-bone pipe, had asked to see an Angolan bank note. Unimpressed, he fingered the bill with mild curiosity. Two Western journalists hiking with Tchimbuembue had sparked more interest. The puzzled tribesmen tugged at blonde hair, mistaking it for a wig of horse fur. Then, with admirable tact, they asked one of the strangers if she was a man or woman.

When it comes to so-called ""lost tribes,"" the jungles of Brazil or New Guinea spring quickest to mind, not the outback of Angola. To most of the world, Angola is a war, not a country: a distant killing field packed with land mines and ""blood diamonds,"" where the weapon of choice is neither spear nor arrow, but a thoroughly modern AK-47 assault rifle.

Yet here in Angola's empty quarter, a moonscape of bare rock and sand just north of the Namibian border, one of Africa's longest and ugliest conflicts has wrought a fragile miracle at the turn of the millennium: the preservation of a forgotten, Iron-Age tribe of herders who anthropologists say are the most culturally intact on the continent.

Cut off by 25 years of fighting between Angolan troops and UNITA rebels, buffered to the south by the nearly roadless wastes of the Namib, as few as 1,000 nomadic Himba still wander Angola's remote southwestern corner, driving their goats and long-horned cattle between precious water holes, and conducting feasts for their ancestors as they have for centuries.

A recent journey into the lonesome region, perhaps the first such trip by Western journalists in many years, revealed a self-sufficient people who are far more traditional than their cousins in neighboring Namibia, where Westernized Himba are becoming a tourist attraction to match Kenya's famous Masai herders. Camping under the stars of an older Africa, Angola's nomads have thrived in isolation. Their children and livestock are fat and healthy. And ironically, as forgotten as the Himba are, it is the Angolan government, mired in a dehumanizing and impoverishing war, that seems ""lost"" by comparison.

""Two things have kept these people as amazingly unchanged as they are,"" said Francisco Giner Abati, a Spanish anthropologist who has visited Angola during lulls in the country's civil war.

""The first is that they have nothing the government and rebels can fight over -- no oil, no diamonds. The second is that Angola's reputation is so terrible that nobody ever goes there to bother them.""

The paradox of this time warp Abati need hardly mention: With every shaky step Angola takes toward peace and normalcy, the Himba's long isolation crumbles further.

At the moment, for example, Angola's diehard UNITA rebels are cowed by powerful government offensives. The brutal war, fueled by diamonds and oil, is ebbing. And the Angolan government, capitalizing on this period of relative peace, is hoping to launch an ecotourism industry that will rock the nomad's world.

A moribund national park near Luanda, the slum-ringed capital, is being revived for visitors. Its poached savannas will be restocked with elephants from Botswana later this month.

Iona National Park, a spectacular chunk of the Namib Desert encompassing 5,000 square miles of the Himba's homeland, is next on the agenda.

""It is our biggest and best park,"" said Lucas Miranda, the chief of the National Office of Protected Areas in Luanda. ""Even today it is very safe. It was never mined. And it still has lots of animals.""

Miranda, a Czech-trained forester, said his government is eager to create a trans-boundary park joining Iona with the famed Skeleton Coast Park in Namibia -- a nation that earns $500 million from tourism every year. Iona, the thinking goes, would funnel some of that bonanza across the border.

""We want to show the world Angola's beauty,"" Miranda said.

Nobody, of course, has consulted the Himba about these extravagant plans. Nobody, for that matter, has taken the trouble to even find the nomads.

Stretched like a dried animal hide across 13,000 square miles of wilderness, Angola's parched corner of the Namib has effectively slid off the map of Africa since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

The few colonial-era roads and campsites have eroded into the dust. Iona itself is a fiction, with a handful of unpaid rangers gamely patrolling small areas on donkey or foot.

The park's bigger wildlife -- elephant and rhino -- were shot out during a border war with the white-ruled South Africa 20 years ago. (Flying over the area recently, a Namibian anthropologist noticed that terrified Himba bolted at the sight of her helicopter; they thought the aircraft was South African, and that the war was still on.)

And today, the Angolan government's only permanent presence in a desert as big as Belgium are two police outposts manned by desperately lonely officers. When visitors stopped at one barracks recently, the commander promptly shot himself in the hand so he could be evacuated.

Yet as outlandish as Angola's ecotourism dreams might seem, the bureaucrats in Luanda are right about one thing -- the haunting beauty of a region few outsiders have seen in decades.

Spared the combat that has wrecked most of Angola, the Namib shelters primordial vistas that are fading from much of southern Africa.

Vast, brittle grasslands still harbor large, free-roaming herds of springbok and kudu antelope. Rare welwitschia plants, living fossils with a 1,000-year life span, grow by the thousands in rocky flats. The desert's empty Atlantic shore, unfished for decades, teems with endangered sea turtles and seal rookeries.

And in the shimmering heat waves of distance, a red-painted people, like figures from an ancient rock painting, drive their animals towards ephemeral springs and pen them in corrals made of thorn brush.

""All the cows you see have a name,"" Coyambo, a middle-aged Himba, said proudly of his dozens of cattle. ""We call them by their names and they come. They are our friends.""

Supremely self-sufficient, tough, stoic, Coyambo seemed unfazed by the appearance of strangers at his family's onganda, or temporary camp. A few tin cans and scraps of canvas betrayed the only evidence of modern Africa at his mud-and-stick shelter. Otherwise, everything came from the desert--his cowhide sandals, the sinew string on a hunting bow, a snuffbox fashioned from a 20-year-old grenade casing found in the sands.

Smeared with the trademark Himba sunscreen of red minerals and buttermilk, Coyambo described how Angolan traders sometimes trudged five days into the desert to barter cloth for fat Himba goats. The only other outside contact came from long treks into Namibia to visit relatives or exchange livestock for lifesaving medicines.

Near Coyambo's homestead, other Himba tended small plots of maize on the sandy banks of the Cunene River. Stately women in headdresses made from lopped-off goats' ears guarded the crops from baboons. One wizened old man remembered the war against the Portuguese colonists. He did not know that the fighting continues, now between Angola's two old liberation movements -- or that it has claimed 500,000 lives.

""War and famine have disrupted so many African societies that it's weird to see Angola's mess actually keep a culture intact,"" said Margaret Jacobsohn, an anthropologist working on indigenous rights issues in Namibia, where some 10,000 Himba live.

""With no cash economy, no commercial alcohol, no missionaries and no schools, the Angolan Himba are probably like ours were 20 years ago,"" Jacobsohn said. ""The question now is how to ease them into the modern world on their own terms.""

The record for doing that in Africa -- or the Amazon, or New Guinea, or any other place where the last vestiges of tribal culture are dissolving -- is bleak.

In Namibia, for example, the Himba were recruited into the South African army as scouts. Today, many younger people have lost interest in cattle, opting for cash jobs instead. Himba women charge tourists to have their photograph taken. Some Himba villages now look suspiciously like slums.

""Governments are embarrassed by these people and tour operators want to keep them in a museum,"" said Jacobsohn. ""Nobody ever asks the Himba what they want. Television? Cows? Those decisions must be theirs.""

For certain, nobody is asking the Himba in Angola.

Pressed to list their needs, the nomads frown, as if being tested, and lump together abstractions -- hospitals, machetes. Then they go back to the task at hand: grinding snuff on a desert stone, or milking a cow with a gourd bucket clamped between their knees.

""All my ancestors are buried here,"" said herder Eri Pandera, explaining why he doesn't leave for Namibia, where the modern world beckons. ""Their graves are here. We cannot leave them alone.""

Pandera, like all his fellow tribespeople, communicates with the dead through a sacred fire built at every family compound. He carries a pinch of ash from camp to camp, so that, symbolically, the fire never goes out. In the trackless Namib, anthropologists believe that the Himba's firelight has been flickering like this since the 1600s, when they arrived as part of the great Bantu migrations from the north.

""They've been in this place a long time, and they should be allowed to stay,"" said Joao Manuel Serodio, a former administrator of Angola's beleaguered park system who is pushing the country's first ecotourism campaign. ""They must be regulated, though. We must control them so they don't harm the park.""

Serodio, sitting 500 miles north of the Namib in a cramped Luanda office darkened by a power failure, was a busy man with little time for lost tribes. But many average Angolans do care. Indeed, lost-tribe stories seem to abound in Angola, and all of them are tinged with a wistful, fairy-tale quality.

Weary young soldiers conscripted into Angola's brutal war tell of a stunted people who live in holes in the country's heavily mined Moxico province. These Angolan pygmies, they say, come out only at night. They also tell of wild tribesmen in the Namib who smear themselves with ash and pass for baboons.

These are stories about escaping the ruin that is modern Angola. But in the ancient Namib, the fairy tale is real.

Recently, on the banks of the Cunene River, a Himba woman gave birth. She lay on her side on a goatskin, in the shade of a camel-thorn bush. The baby was stunned, silent and damp. Already daubed with ochre, it stared wide-eyed out into the glare of the oldest desert in the world."
58,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"The rains start in October in Katanga province, with huge drops that fall as they do only in the tropics, straight and hard, like a hail of ball bearings.

Water pools. And then, restlessly, the runoff begins to move. It slides northward across an immense red savanna, once home to an African king who played two colonial powers off against each other, only to be shot for his cleverness. The water creases into rivulets, which soon merge into small, sluggish creeks. One of these creeks flows past a mine that once supplied the uranium for America's first atom bomb. Another, snaking miles away on a plain of strange, bone-white mud, sluices between the bare, spindly legs of Paul Katoji.

""Gold,"" whispers Katoji, holding up a grain of shiny metal on the tip of his thumb.

The skinny prospector stares hungrily at the glinting crumb. He is poor and has a wife and four small children to feed. Like scores of other men, he scratches in the stream for gold, surviving on the mercy of the tributary. The stream, fed now by hungry men's sweat, drains the tailings of an enormous mine closed by war. These dregs hold untold tons of gold along with an estimated 180,000 tons of the strategic metal cobalt. Every day Katoji, clad in patched shorts, sifts his water-wrinkled fingers through a discarded treasure worth more than a billion dollars.

In this way, from this wretched paradox, the Congo River is born.

If rivers can be the biographers of a landscape, gathering not just the silt but the stories of the nations they traverse, then the tale of the Congo River today is one of epic, almost hallucinatory tragedy: For more than two years now, one of the world's mightiest waterways has gushed through the heart of Africa's most dangerous and debilitating war.

Rising from Congo's rich mineral fields, the Congo River curves north into a primordial jungle that now absorbs the racketing gunfire of at least a half-dozen dueling armies. The river's currents, so massive they bulge 5 feet with the tug of a full moon, glide past ruined cities and abandoned villages. Nearly 3,000 miles later, swollen now by some 7,000 miles of tributaries, they reflect the skyscrapers of Kinshasa, a capital city where idled barges crammed with refugees provide a backdrop for water-skiing diplomats and relief workers.

Dip a finger into the river's burbling headwaters; it isn't the distant pounding of the Atlantic surf you feel, but the faint vibrations of war.

Little seen by outsiders, this clash over Africa's vast center has been muffled by the remoteness of the battlefield--a trackless forest bigger than Western Europe. Yet as faraway as it may seem, the war is perhaps the defining conflict in modern Africa, a struggle over power and wealth that heralds a depressing new era of instability for the world's poorest continent.

Diplomats call it ""Africa's First World War"" because the armies of seven nations, three squabbling rebel groups and a rabble of militias are ensnared in fighting that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.

The rebels, mostly boys in gum boots, have occupied the eastern half of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa's third-largest nation, with the help of troops from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, who claim to be protecting their flanks from marauding guerrillas. The western and southern half of the million-square-mile country remains in government hands, but only with military support of allies Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

It is a war of rusty barges tricked out with artillery that sink in river skirmishes ignored by the world; the warm currents, watched over by squalling gray parrots or shrieking monkeys, carry away the dead.

It is war where jets scratch the equatorial skies, dropping a lone bomb, like an egg, into a rainforest second in size only to the Amazon. A war where thatched villages and tin-roofed towns fall and are retaken in a scramble for gold, diamonds and timber as much as for political power.

In this festering tropical garden, millions of Congolese hunker in the shadows by armed strangers who come from far-off lands. In Katanga's provincial capital of Lubumbashi, located 150 miles from the Congo River's source, Zimbabwean soldiers relax from lonely guard duty at remote diamond mines. Crew-cut Asian men in cheap shoes hurry past on dirt sidewalks--North Korean military trainers who drill the troops of Congolese President Laurent Kabila in exchange for diamonds or, according to some, uranium.

Far from the towns, out in the immense jungles, ghastly rumors drift through the forest like foul swamp gas--tales of atrocities committed against civilians trapped in the chaos.

""In January in the Kamituga area of South Kivu Province, Mai Mai leader Silvestre Louetcha reportedly executed 32 women who had supported the mwami [traditional ruler] of Kamituga in resisting Mai Mai demands for forced labor,"" notes a recent U.S. State Department report on human rights in the Congo. ""Before killing these women, the Mai Mai reportedly accused them of witchcraft, then cut their breasts off and forced them to eat their own breasts ... There were also reports that Mai Mai units killed persons by crucifying them.""

Such savagery is hauntingly echoed in another report:

""We fell upon them all and killed them without mercy ... [Our leader] ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades, also their sexual members, and to hang the women and children on the palisades in the form of a cross.""

Yet this last dispatch was written a century ago, by a European officer massacring Congolese villagers in the service of Belgium's King Leopold II, the most despotic of Africa's colonizers. Far from reverting to ancient tribal violence, Congo's modern combatants are simply updating the bloody colonial quest for rubber and ivory. Back then, as today, such horrors were kept secret. But the Congo remembers. Few countries are as scarred by their history.

""South Africa's turn to democracy may be the biggest success story in Africa since the Cold War,"" said Jakkie Potgieter, an expert with South Africa's Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria. ""But the Congo is our biggest failure. You've got this rich, gigantic country in the middle of the continent that's sucking the whole region into disaster. If it drags on much longer, there really is no pulling back. It becomes another Angola.""

It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

The fall of Congo strongman Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, after 32 years of fantastically corrupt rule, should have marked a new beginning not only for some 50 million long-suffering Congolese, but for the continent as a whole.

Mobutu, a leopard-skin-capped tyrant created by the CIA as a bulwark against communism in Africa, cannibalized his own country. In the jungles of Congo, then called Zaire, he built lavish European villas and Chinese pagodas, and stocked them with French wines flown in by chartered Concordes.

Yet when Mobutu finally crumpled before the rebel armies of Kabila, Congo's new president, no renaissance followed. Instead, a tempting new power vacuum and the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda led to the spilling of new blood on the richest real estate in Africa.

In the last three years, Rwanda has marched thousands of troops into Congo to root out the murderous Hutu militias responsible for slaughtering 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis. Uganda has done much the same to squash its own Congo-based enemies. Unhappy with Kabila's inability to control his borders, both countries are supporting armed groups inside Congo with the aim of bringing the new president down. In true Congo fashion, the rebels spend most of their time bickering among themselves. There are now rebels who have rebelled against the rebels, and the jungles swarm with men of questionable allegiances and lots of guns.

As for Kabila, a pudgy former guerrilla with a taste for Mao suits and expensive whiskey, he has declared it his ""sacred duty"" to free Congo's soil of all foreign armies--albeit with the assistance of three foreign armies from sympathetic states. Billboard-size portraits adorning the capital, Kinshasa, show Kabila squinting warily upward, as if searching for the first plane out of his ruined nation.

Amid all the confusion, the killing goes on. And it is growing worse.

A peace accord signed last year is unraveling. The United Nations now says that hundreds of thousands of civilians have died and 1.8 million more are displaced in the region--six times the number of refugees who stampeded out of Kosovo. These figures are guesses. Most humanitarian groups have abandoned the Congo in utter frustration.

""Congo has never really been a true nation,"" says I. William Zartmann, an analyst at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. ""Mobutu treated the place like his private property and held it together with payoffs. This war is a test of Congo's viability as a nation.""

He noted ruefully how Africa's first continental war, a painful test facing the region in the new millennium, is relegated ""pretty much to the bottom of the barrel"" of U.S. foreign policy.

""Where else in the world is the future so unresolved, so up for grabs?"" Zartmann asked. ""Will Congo break up? Will it stay whole? ... It's maddening, but it's also amazing.""

Into this troubled, half-made world the Congo River flows, snaking more than 2,900 miles through a sprawling combat zone.

It is an iconic stream, the former portal to central Africa; up to 9 miles wide in places, it is the sixth-longest river in the world. A quarter-million boat passengers once traveled its powerful currents every year. And Africa, like an upended horn of plenty, once spilled a fortune in diamonds, palm oil, coffee, rubber, gold, bush meat, ivory and hardwoods down its silty waters.

Yet if Joseph Conrad could steam up the Congo again as he did in 1890, the author of the brooding classic ""Heart of Darkness"" would instantly recognize the grim desolation of long-gone colonial times--""an empty stream, a great silence, and impenetrable forest.""

Today, with the mighty Congo River cut by war, millions who once depended on this vital waterway are stranded in the continent's vast interior. Only hand-poled dugouts crawl in places along the riverbanks.

And in the immense no man's land of central Congo, the jungle is quietly swallowing whole cities, turning them into modern-day versions of Mayan ruins.

A recent five-week journey down the war-strangled currents of the Congo River often revealed a stream of drowned hopes. But in important ways the Congo is also a river of the future. New ways of life are being invented today in the heart of Africa. Millions of people, forsaken by the rest of the world, are adapting and surviving, arts at which the Congolese excel.

""Tell Clinton he cannot kill us,"" declared Katoji, the impoverished gold prospector at the Congo's headwaters.

Like many Congolese, he believes the United States is secretly guiding his forgotten war. He can't comprehend that his misery has no greater design, no purpose. Had not America, he asked, backed the thief Mobutu? And wasn't America now an ally of the invader Rwanda?

Standing in murky waters that begrudged so little of their true wealth, he offered, as a gesture of goodwill, his paltry grain of gold to a stranger.

The double curse of Africa

The exact source of the Congo River arises 100 miles south of Katoji's diggings, atop a seabed a billion years old, now a grassy plain speckled with round African huts.

This ancient sea was a sump; it collected the metals leached by rivers from a primordial continent, concentrating them in its sediments, hardening them into stone. Eons later, the stones, smelted into copper, would make the tribes of Katanga rich--so much so that colonial Belgium and Britain would jockey over their lands. The Katangans' last king, Misiri, was the principal victim of this dispute. He was shot down in 1890 by the Belgians, who couldn't buy him off with cases of gin.

Two more conflicts, far bloodier wars of secession, would be fought in Katanga soon after Congo's 1960 independence.

It is fitting, then, that the Congo River today should have its roots buried deep in Congo's baneful mineral wealth--deposits worth billions in copper, zinc, cobalt, uranium, gold and manganese that have brought little but grief to central Africa.

""This is the double curse of Africa,"" argues Mabi Mulumba, an economist at the University of Kinshasa. ""We aren't just killing ourselves over our extravagant riches--no, that is not enough. We fight over our potential riches as well.

""All of this gold sitting in the ground? What good is it? It is not even being worked and may never be because of our situation. But that doesn't matter. We still fight as if it were in our pockets right now.""

The cynicism of the old East-West struggle in Africa, Mulumba said, is being eclipsed by a new brand of madness: a brazen scramble for loot among Africans themselves.

Politics and nationalism still kill in Africa, of course. The recent, murderous border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea was about little else. But ideology has been overtaken by lucre in a way unseen since colonial times.

Angola, the classic proxy war between capitalism and communism, has turned into a battle between oil and diamond interests. And the terrible mass amputations that have bloodied Sierra Leone began years ago, in a tug-of-war over lucrative diamond fields.

Yet the Congo war, because of its bizarre roster of combatants and the sheer pile of its booty, remains in a brazen and greedy class by itself.

Hundreds of miles north from the Congo River's fabulously rich source, across the war's invisible front lines, Ugandan officers aiding the rebels even specialize in commodities: one colonel goes for gold, another for coffee, a third for papain--the extract from papayas used in processed foods. Lucrative diamond bourses have sprung up in the capital of rebel-allied Rwanda, a country without of a single diamond mine of its own.

""It reminds me of us,"" joked a European mining consultant in Lubumbashi, the capital of Katanga province and the city closest to where the Congo River is born.

""The Africans are carving up Congo the way the colonialists carved up Africa,"" he says. ""It has less to do with ideology or even military strategy than with spheres of economic influence. We have taught them well.""

The consultant sits in a pleasant office that is calm, even peaceful, because business is dead in the mining fields of Katanga. His satellite telephone rarely rings. He whiles the time away sipping coffee at Planet Hollybum, the restaurant where the last die-hard expatriate miners sit immobile at tables, as if conserving their energy for some unknown but unavoidable calamity looming ahead.

And this is the irony haunting the Congo River's headwaters: While opposing armies poke and scrape for gold or diamonds, the gigantic apparatus of Congo's legitimate mining industry sits paralyzed. Rots.

To drive through Katanga province today is to witness first-hand what novelist V.S. Naipaul described as Congo's surreal atmosphere of lost chances, a place where ""your life and ambition had already been lived out for you and you were looking at the relics of that life.""

Enormous open-pit mines stare idly at the tropical skies. Aging smelters from Belgian times sit rusting on the savannas, puffing away at 10 percent capacity. And children walk obliviously to school through 60 million tons of mining debris that would make any industrialized nation salivate. The tailings brim with the richest concentrations of cobalt--a metal crucial in aircraft manufacture--in the world.

The government mining company that once oversaw most of these projects, a giant corporation known by its acronym GECAMINES, is comatose. At its peak, it was the biggest mining operation on the continent and the spine of Congo's economy, generating $2.2. billion in exports a year. Decades of rapacious thievery by dictator Mobutu crippled the industry. In 1988 alone, the kleptomaniac who dubbed himself ""the all-powerful warrior who goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake,"" stole $400 million in mining profits. But the war has sealed its doom.

With investors scared off by the fighting, copper production has collapsed from a 1980s peak of 470,000 tons a year to only 30,000. Cobalt is down from 18,000 tons to a mere 3,000.

The result: an eerie landscape of waiting.

The silent mines wait. The roads, unrolling emptily across the brittle plains and built with millions in World Bank funds, wait. Even the Congo River, its waters so mineralized that they swirl orange, a cocktail of oxides, waits.

And the people--especially the people--wait.

Lubumbashi feels like a city holding its breath. Thousands of people walk miles from the shantytowns to the shops downtown because there is no gasoline for buses. Thousands more, unemployed, stand on sidewalks or sit under the falling blossoms of flame trees.

""We're the Democratic Republic of waiting,"" says a Congolese smelter owner who laid off 80 percent of his workforce. ""I wake up every morning and it is like sleep-walking. We go through the motions, and the world passes us by.""

In effect, 50 million Congolese are waiting. But for what?

""For a savior,"" says Rev. Kasongo Hulumba.

A request for one true God

Two half-finished steeples jut above the trees of Lubumbashi. This is the Kimbanguist Church, one of the few buildings under construction in the only large city close to the source of the Congo River.

""Despite the hardships of war our temple continues to grow,"" says Hulumba. ""This is to say, we feel that if you follow Kimbangu, miracles will abound.""

Hulumba sits in a small rectory office furnished with plastic lawn chairs. A wire pokes through the middle of the ceiling, as if from heaven, and descends to Hulumba's intermittently ringing phone. He is the local pastor of Congo's home-grown religion, which worships a flamboyant healer named Simon Kimbangu, who died in prison in 1951.

Kimbangu preached that a black messiah was coming to the Congo. Fired by colonial injustices as much as spiritual redemption, he foretold a day when whites would be expelled by the African paradise that had once belonged to the Congolese. His sermons triggered mass unrest against the Belgians. They first condemned him to death, then commuted his sentence to life imprisonment; the man believed by millions of followers to be the incarnation of the Holy Spirit languished in Lubumbashi's jail for 30 years.

Today, impoverished Kimbanguists pray for peace at the patio where Kimbangu was flogged; removing their shoes, the pilgrims kneel on the concrete, revealing socks worn through at the soles.

Cults of many types have erupted everywhere in wartime Congo. In hard times, imported Christianity has been whittled and shaped to meet local demand; relief from the suffering and uncertainty of a war the world ignores.

""All we request is one true god,"" explained Hulumba, a friendly man in sandals.

Yet what the Congo has been left with instead is a trinity of gold, diamonds and cobalt. Or Kabila: According to Congo's information minister, a recycled Mobutu crony, the new president is divinely inspired.

The Congo River describes a huge arc northward out of the fading El Dorado that is Katanga. From an airplane, the stream looks like a necklace of quicksilver reflecting the noonday sun. After hundreds of miles, it drops slowly out of the savanna and into thickening woodlands, then into Congo's vast tropical rainforest, which is synonymous here with the war.

Crashing over several sets of milky rapids, the river slides past old slaving outposts and abandoned palm-oil factories to a village called Lokutu. And here, at a wooden chapel, another Congolese sect smolders on. It worships Patrice Lumumba, Congo's martyred liberation leader.

Charming and erratic, Lumumba was one of the heroes of post-colonial Africa. But his nationalist rhetoric and coziness with the Soviets alarmed the Western powers; this impulsiveness cost him dear.

The CIA hoped to poison him in 1960, but Mobutu and other political enemies took care of him first. One day after Lumumba's execution, the delighted CIA station chief in Kinshasa walked to the Congo River and dumped his vial of toxin into the Congo River, a stream of what-might-have-beens.

And so, today, the members of the Lumumba-God church are waiting, like just everyone else in Congo.

This is what they say: When Lumumba comes back to save them, he will walk Christ-like across the unforgiving waters of a river that bears their country's name."
59,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"There are two new burial grounds in this steamy river town.

Gaston Nyimu Kaya built one. It looks like a small Arlington cemetery.

""We buried the people we could identify here,"" says Nyimu, the young Red Cross chief of Kisangani. He points to long rows of wet graves laid out in a precise grid. By a clean-swept communal tomb carefully hedged with bricks, he says, ""These people were more difficult. Some of them had been lying in the streets for a week.""

The dead are Nyimu's neighbors, citizens of Kisangani killed in a pointless battle between the Ugandan and Rwandan armies in Congo's civil war. Nyimu wants their resting place to be clean. He is a meticulous man who relishes neatness. Clad in a traditional tunic and trousers stenciled with colorful maps of Congo--""A Happy Country"" the pattern says in French--he surveys his domain with satisfaction. It is a drizzly day, and the water drips from the white crosses like tears.

Outside his graveyard fence a less tidy Congo resumes.

A weedy mass grave bulges nearby, filled with the remains of ethnic Tutsis butchered in an earlier pogrom. And Kisangani itself is an unkempt corpse. Blasted by 6,000 high-explosive shells in June, the city is reverting to jungle. Trees grow out of the roofs of its university buildings. Hungry professors grow cassava in the boulevards below.

Kisangani's second new cemetery flows nearby; Ugandan troops have dumped scores of their dead comrades into the muddy currents of the Congo River.

""The only thing the UN peacekeepers did was send out bulletins to the world,"" Nyimu recalls of the fighting that destroyed his city. Standing in his sodden black dress shoes, gazing out over what may be the cleanest cemetery in Africa, he adds: ""As it turned out, the world couldn't care less about our obituaries.""

Two years after the outbreak of civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world still largely ignores the body count in central Africa. Most of the cemeteries here are just humps of red mud in the jungles. And the mighty Congo River, curving like a giant scythe through the battle zone, often conspires to hide the dead.

Yet only two weeks ago, the United Nations announced that some 600,000 children under 5 have probably perished from hunger, disease and violence in Congo's war. Assuming this staggering figure is correct, it matches all the dead in Angola during its 27 years of nearly continuous fighting.

Far removed from the cameras and headlines, off the political map, Congo bleeds from one of the most lethal, complex wars in the world.

Congo's conflict has been called ""Africa's First World War"" because of its stew of combatants. President Laurent Kabila, supported by allies Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, is struggling to hold on to power against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

Competing armies flying a host of banners--nationalism, rebellion, revenge, profit--make the killing hard to contain. And diplomats worry that the fighting poses the greatest threat to African peace and stability in the new millennium.

Mentioned far less often in international circles is the suffering of the ordinary Congolese. Millions are trapped in the maw of the fighting. Isolated in Africa's interior, harassed by some 100,000 widely scattered troops on all sides, their plight is almost completely unknown.

""Even the fish don't want to stay in Congo anymore,"" said Mosiki Pombolo, a fisherman who lives at some rapids near Kisangani, the remote midway point of the Congo River's 2,900-mile journey to the Atlantic.

Pombolo stared into the Congo's churning currents. Fishing was bad.

""Many, many rockets and bullets have fallen into the river,"" he said finally. ""The fish, when they hear this, go far away. They are just like people. They want tranquility.""

Few outsiders have seen Congo's war up close.

The only real pathway through the vast wilderness of Congo's battlefield is the river itself. Rising from the plains near the Zambian border, it enters the war zone peacefully, from government-held Katanga province, and exits more than 2,000 miles away at the capital city, Kinshasa.

In between, however, travelers floating down the world's sixth-longest river in a canoe are witness to a landscape haunted by war; a place where time appears not only to have stopped, but where the clock seems to have been turned back a century by the fighting.

Strange, car-less cities are subsiding into the sweltering jungle like so many ancient ruins. Highways that once rivaled Brazil's Trans-Amazon, already crumbling from years of neglect, have vanished altogether. In their place, traders push food-laden bicycles 800 miles along greasy jungle footpaths--more than the distance between Atlanta and Chicago.

On a recent afternoon in the heart of the jungle, one of these African versions of the Ho Chi Minh Trail was busy with bicycle merchants rolling and pedaling their wares--live pigs, boxes of dried fish, sacks of sugar--through clouds of shimmering butterflies. Travel time was measured in months.

The mighty Congo River itself, once a winding highway for 250,000 boat passengers a year, has been cut by the front lines. The biggest artery of commerce for central Africa is eerily empty save for a few dugout canoes and the makeshift gunboats of Kabila's government.

""Only the fish can travel freely,"" said Renos Mahamba, a trader from Kisangani who has seen his ""African Queen""-style boats confiscated by rebels and used as troop carriers. ""We are a forgotten island in the middle of the continent. A prison island.""

How many people languish there?

No one knows. The UN study with the numbingly high death toll merely estimates that 16 million ordinary Congolese on both sides of the front lines--fully a third of Congo's population--are either starving or left homeless by the fighting.

""The forests are full of people,"" explains Mahamba. ""Some of them are surviving on wild fruits. Others are surviving by the force of the gun.""

Congo, a strategic country that borders nine other nations, is cursed by its riches and plagued by the circularity of its history.

Today's scramble for political power, gold and diamonds echoes the genocidal reign of Belgium's King Leopold II, a rapacious colonialist whose agents chopped off the hands and heads of countless Congolese in a quest for ivory and rubber.

Colonial riverboats paddled 1,000 miles up the Congo River to present-day Kisangani, trading gunfire with hails of arrows whizzing out of the river's 100-foot walls of trees.

More than half a century later, in 1960, Congo was once again the scene of major bloodshed: It was the first African beachhead of the Cold War.

Some 60,000 UN troops poured through Congo when Africa's richest colony exploded into mayhem after independence. American presidents starting with Kennedy anointed Mobutu Sese Seko, a caricature of a venal African strongman, to hold the line against Soviet meddling. Che Guevara responded by marching with 100 Cubans into the Congolese jungles to foment revolution.

""Nothing leads me to believe that Kabila is the man of the hour,"" Guevara wrote of Congo's current president, a young rebel back in 1965. Guevara complained bitterly that Kabila and other Congolese leaders spent too much time ""in the best hotels, issuing communiques and drinking Scotch in the company of beautiful women."" Huffing with asthma, the Latin American revolutionary abandoned Congo after six months.

Having toppled dictator Mobutu in 1997, Kabila himself now grapples with rebellion. Only today, with the Cold War a memory, nobody is marching to save backwater Congo.

Should a peace deal ever hold, only 5,500 UN troops will be sent to Congo.

""Let me be frank, this is probably the most complex situation the UN has ever found itself in,"" says a UN cease-fire observer stationed in Kisangani, the scene of fighting that claimed at least 700 civilian lives in June. ""You have rebels fighting the government, rebels fighting each other, and foreign supporters on all sides fighting each other too.""

Asked what the fighting in Kisangani was about, he shrugged and placed the tips of his index fingers and thumbs together to form a diamond.

The inner station
An arcane publication of the Central Bank of Congo offers the following key statistics:

Since independence from Belgium, copper production in one of Africa's most industrialized nations dropped from 282,000 tons to 37,000 tons. Official gold production fell from 22,000 pounds to 15 pounds. Cement: 347,000 tons down to 160,000. Palm oil: 244,000 tons to 81,000. The manufacture of shoes: 29,000 pairs to only 1,700. Cloth: 60,000 square meters to 10,000. The list is long.

Only two Congolese commodities buck the trend. Diamond output has climbed from 14 million carats to 20 million. And beer: 1.7 million cases to 4.3 million.

This patterns holds in rebel-held Kisangani, a jungle metropolis halfway down the Congo River, and arguably the most godforsaken city in the world.

""These are the only two industries still functioning in town,"" says Ekopi Kane Mokeni, a half-Lebanese merchant whose fleet of 12 trucks has been stolen by rebel soldiers. ""Diamonds and beer offer escape.""

Mokeni is among a growing number of Congolese who pine not only for the wretched dictatorship of Mobutu, but for the even more dubious days of colonial rule. He remembers when Kisangani--then called Stanleyville--boasted cinemas and clubs that played Glenn Miller. A rough river pearl, Kisangani then looked out across a half-mile of slowly moving brown water bustling with boats of all sizes. Belgian plantation owners, Greek ship captains and Indian shopkeepers rubbed elbows on its busy wharves.

Kisangani's history, however, is a recurring tragedy played by different actors. It has gone from Afro-Arab slaving center to Belgian colonial ivory outpost to independence killing ground. In 1965 rebels clad in monkey skins hacked and speared people to death here, and then ate them. It is the site of novelist Joseph Conrad's ""Inner Station""--the outpost in deepest Africa where Kurtz, the protagonist of ""Heart of Darkness,"" lost his sanity and his soul.

Today, cut off from the central government--marooned, in fact, from the 21st Century--Kisangani has seen at least four major battles in the last two years, all of them turf wars between the occupying armies of Uganda and Rwanda.

It is a weird, post-holocaust metropolis. Four hundred thousand people mill in streets that are virtually empty of motorized traffic. There are no working phones, water or steady power. In one building, men in snappy business suits sit in a second floor office that looks like performance art; the office walls are blown out. Hot winds carry off their paperwork. Though it is Congo's third-largest city, Kisangani runs on barter. In the market, vendors use the city archives to wrap peanuts.

Downtown, however, flashes of fresh paint stand out: new diamond bourses with names like ""American Ninja,"" ""Mr. Cash"" and ""Christ Is Rich.""

The gems, sifted by hand from thousands of gravelly creeks that spill into the Congo River, were a source of fighting between erstwhile allies Uganda and Rwanda in Kisangani. Today, Rwanda flies some of these milky-yellow stones to its capital in old Soviet-made Antonov aircraft. Canned food, ammunition, gasoline and cheap boomboxes trickle back by air.

If the geographic source of the Congo River lies in the faraway savannas of southern Congo, then the political headwaters of Congo's complex war lie to the east, in the ethnic conflicts of Africa's Great Lakes region.

Rwanda ignited the current war after the Hutu militiamen responsible for the genocide of some 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis escaped into the jungles of neighboring Congo. Unable to secure Kabila's help in rooting them out, Rwanda decided to foment rebellion inside Congo--exactly as it once had helped Kabila overthrow Mobutu.

Many bitter Congolese see the Rwandans as the puppet-masters of the war. At the outbreak of the fighting in Kisangani, scores of Rwandan Tutsis were massacred.

""Congolese are joyful people, people who like life,"" says Andre Babusia, a priest whose seminary was smashed by an artillery shell in June. ""But this war has changed us. We are learning to hate well. The Rwandans have infected us with their virus.""

What hasn't changed is the Congolese genius for survival.

Kisangani's stately old parks and streets are given over to survival crops. With rural areas picked clean by marauding soldiers, the city now actually exports food to the nearby countryside.

Hundreds of youths, meanwhile, have attached padded seats to the backs of their bicycles: Kisangani taxis. Women riding these seats have broken new fashion ground; they wear trousers.

""We are inventing a new vocabulary for the war,"" says Samuel Benda Ndomba, a jovial man who always carries a briefcase. ""We call these bicycles 'toleka,' which means 'Let's go!'""

Ndomba is a language professor at Kisangani's comatose university. He is a British-trained linguist and the author of a doctoral thesis titled ""A Lexico-Semantic Study of Word Derivations in Bantu Languages: Some Applications.""

Currently, he is growing cassava, a starchy root, to feed his family.

The professor's river
One day, Ndomba decides to travel down the Congo River to the town of Bumba. He does this as a favor to us, as a guide.

The Congo River runs miles wide in the country's war zone; a big, flexed muscle that arcs 1,000 navigable miles from here down to the capital, Kinshasa. It is king of a watershed that covers 1 million square miles, all of central Africa. It pours more fresh water into the sea than any other stream in the world save the Amazon.

From Kisangani, Congo's main hinterland city, the waters roll west and then south toward the Atlantic Ocean. Scores, then hundreds of islands appear in the warm stream, some of them bigger than Manhattan but covered only in giant, dripping trees.

Bumba, some 250 miles downstream, is about as far as it is safe to journey downstream now. Few boats of any kind make even this short passage. Congo's two rebel groups, the Congolese Rally for Democracy and the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo, control the river's banks across shadowy lines of control. The armed boys in gum boots and soccer shirts who wave their guns from the jungled banks are unpredictable.

This is the war in Congo's vast interior: a soldier of uncertain allegiance demanding something--anything--at gunpoint.

""The war has stopped everything,"" said a youth named Albert at a fisherman's camp. ""Most of the camps have fallen apart because of the attacks by soldiers. They loot. They rape our women. So we run into the forest and eat berries like our ancestors.""

Missionaries and the few humanitarian groups still operating in Congo's rebel-held east confirm social devastation on a staggering scale. The aid group Doctors Without Borders reports populations of 150,000, 400,000, even 500,000 people living in the bush without access to as much as a single aspirin. The few clinics have been looted. The medics chased away. Resurgent diseases such as malaria, experts say, are by far the biggest killers in the Congo war.

""Stanley would probably feel at home on this river,"" says linguist Ndomba, referring to American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, the first white to descend the Congo in the 1870s. Stanley shot his way down the long river, spilling the blood of hundreds of attacking tribal warriors into the currents along the way.

Ndomba sits cramped under a rainbow-colored umbrella in a 25-foot-long canoe. Riding with him are an agronomist and two women soap traders who have overcome their fears to make their first business trip on the river in a year. They plug the leaking canoe with dabs of soap while Ndomba expounds on his semantic theory of the war.

The Congo's more than 250 tribal languages, he says, are not a potential root of warfare. Instead, it is the imperfect application of a foreign lingua franca, like Congo's national language, French, that leads to misunderstandings, confusion and aggression.

Politicians say ""the people"" not knowing it means only men in certain tongues. Or they hide behind foreign words like ""democracy,"" ""development"" and ""geopolitics,"" which have no exact local meaning, thus raising false hopes--or suspicion.

""We talk ourselves into war,"" says Ndomba.

Ndomba recites the poetry of Robert Frost while the canoe floats past impenetrable jungle.

The dark windows of abandoned palm oil factories gape now and then over the Congo's empty currents. The sharp cries of fish eagles are often the only sounds echoing over a glassy stream on sweaty afternoons. At night, the river mirrors the sky so perfectly that paddling down it after dark is like floating through the cosmos, with stars above, below and all around.

Two days later, the canoe slides off the desolate currents of the Congo River at Bumba, one of the last ports before the river switches into government hands. The town of 60,000 is lit at night by thousands of little cups of burning palm oil. Five lumber mills line the riverfront, all of them shut down, their equipment looted. Without saws, the people have begun using the doors in their homes to build coffins.

""Who are the real people driving this war?"" Ndomba asks bitterly, seeing the ruined town.

He repeats the two questions that are voiced by virtually all the Congolese who are trapped in Africa's biggest war: ""Who is behind it all? Who is benefiting from it?""

The children's crusade
In Gemena, a town about 100 miles north of the Congo River near a tributary called the Ubangi, a lone jet buzzes high across the hot, tropical sky and drops a bomb.

Sometimes this bomb does not explode. It embeds itself in the mud of the jungle like a raisin in soft dough. On other occasions it may crush a hut. Or perhaps it does detonate, and kills. This is another face of war in the Congo: dying as if by lightning strike. ""Mal chance,"" the Congolese say, bad luck.

""I am very afraid when I hear a plane,"" says Janet Gbademogo, a thin, nervous young mother in this rebel-held town. ""When I think I hear one, I run into the trees. I stay there for hours.""

A 10-foot-wide crater is all that is left of the bomb that fell into Gbademogo's mud yard. The bomb had been kicked out of a government cargo plane. It decapitated one of her young nephews and killed eight other people. The youngest was Moise Fiokowose, 4, her son.

President Kabila is bombing the northern territory of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) more frequently these days. Government troops also are on the move in Congo's far south. Despite almost monthly diplomatic summits, the Congo war is heating up.

""Our patience is running out,"" says Jean-Pierre Bemba, the leader of the MLC, a Ugandan-backed rebel group based in Mobutu's old tribal homeland.

The son of one of Congo's richest businessmen, Bemba, who favors bluejeans and colorful African shirts, has established his forward headquarters at an abandoned coffee plantation.

""Either Kabila accepts the Lusaka accord or we attack him,"" he says defiantly. ""It is that simple.""

In truth, all sides have been violating Congo's battered cease-fire agreement. Recent negotiations aside, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), backed by Rwandan troops, has been on the move in Katanga. And Bemba's own soldiers are trying to encircle a river town called Mbandaka, the last upstream stop before the capital Kinshasa--and power.

But who are the Congolese rebels? Who, as the Congolese ask endlessly, are the people driving the war?

There only can be one answer: strangers. From the foreign armies pursuing their own interests to the supposedly home-grown rebels they support, the people guiding Africa's First World War are strangers.

Many of the insurgents are young, affluent expatriates, the children of old Mobutuists or anti-Mobutuists who have spent much of their lives far from Africa. Bemba's ""foreign minister,"" a businessman in Belgium, is now attempting to relearn Lingala, the national language. The ""commissar of foreign affairs"" for a rebel group called RCD-Kisangani is a young Congolese doctor from Cincinnati.

On the government side the trend is much the same. Kabila's interior minister washed glasses at a Brussels cafe. A former foreign minister was a psychoanalyst in Paris. The new chief of forestry spent years as a professional student in Kentucky. Even Kabila, who had not visited Congo's capital in 30 years, spent most his life as an exile in East Africa.

In some ways, the chaotic war at the heart of Africa seems like a medieval children's crusade: a parade of young outsiders sent to conquer the Holy Land. The analogy is not perfect. Congolese warlords are not innocents. But their outsiders' brutal ignorance, and the sorrows it has planted, are the same.

""You can hardly get around this in Africa,"" argues a Western diplomat in Kinshasa. ""Who else has the expertise to run a country in a place like Congo? Or run a war? And what is wrong with coming back home and getting involved?""

Yet the startling fact remains: At the turn of the millennium, 40 years after the end of colonialism, many African leaders are still not connected, in any fundamental way, to their own people. In Congo, the figure most responsible for this debilitating gulf was himself a man of the soil. Mobutu, a lowly army sergeant who died a broken king in exile in 1997, still rules Congo through bleak absences. He destroyed a generation of leadership. He made today's crusade possible.

""For 32 years he kept us like children,"" says David Sinalokumbe, a high school student in Bumba, the dying river town. ""So we pulled him down and threw him in the river.""

Sinalokumbe gestured at a concrete plinth in Bumba's plaza where a bronze statue of the dictator once gazed down on his subjects. The platform has been empty for three years.

Sinalokumbe, a smart and ambitious youth, practices poling a canoe on the Congo River every afternoon--learning his grandfather's skills because the huge ferries, carrying 2,000 passengers and tons of goods from Kinshasa, no longer dock here. Cautiously, he keeps close to the shores of powerful currents that draw waters from a million square miles around, into the immense, invisible heart of a war that appears to have no end."
60,Chicago Tribune,Paul Salopek,2001,Congo Health Politics,"The invalids line their wheelchairs along the edge of the pier, high above the Congo River's swirling, deadly currents, as if about to plunge in.

But they are not suicidal. They are in a race. And they must solve an important puzzle: How can they board the approaching ferry without being kicked or beaten? What is the best way to avoid the bullying laborers who soon will drop crushing, 120-pound sacks of rice onto the pier? When, and for how long, should they pause to dodge the barrels of solvent that will come rolling down the loading ramp? And can they really move fast enough to squeeze past that Mercedes where a rich man sits with his windows rolled up, honking impatiently to drive onto the boat?

When the ferry from Brazzaville drops its plank, the matter is resolved within minutes. Hundreds of people stampede off its deck, elbowing hundreds more who shove to get on. In between, the men in wheelchairs swivel and probe, rolling this way, nudging that way, seeking openings. Policemen in khaki swing at the passengers with webbed belts, bits of garden hose, rubber fan belts, knotted ropes and wires. A stevedore slips and spills a bale of peanuts. Short, sharp pushing matches break out.

But slowly, tenaciously, with small compromises, the handicappes of Kinshasa advance steadily up the ramp.

""It helps to be like us,"" says Gode Mowangi, one of hundreds of polio-stricken traders who eke out their living transporting goods across the Congo River on their wheelchairs. ""You are invisible. People let you alone.""

Many of Kinshasa's 5 million citizens must feel something like Mowangi these days--ignored by the world, swept up in a gigantic brawl that is being fought largely over their heads, and scrambling to survive, to avoid being trampled to death.

The brawl in this case involves a sprawling, regional war of unprecedented scale in Africa. Deep in the continent's belly, a rabble of Congolese militias and seven different armies are fighting over whether President Laurent Kabila should remain in power. The conflict has ripped Congo in half.

Congo's war is to some extent a river war; the Congo River's 7,000 miles of navigable tributaries often define the route of an army's advance. To follow its bent course, then, is to follow the flow of the conflict itself--from the mineral-rich headwaters in Katanga, to the steamy jungles controlled by rebels, to the mighty waterway's final dash for the sea near Congo's forsaken river capital, Kinshasa.

But if the Congo River today tells the story of a rich, vital nation imploding into chaos, then it tells a bigger story too. Far beyond the Congo's million-square-mile watershed, politicians and diplomats are whispering that the Congo war could drag Africa into unprecedented crisis.

Some fear Kabila will fight to keep power at any cost, including even the fracturing of Africa's third-largest nation.

Should this happen, analysts say, the murky struggle in Congo will become the defining African war of the new century. And the resulting upheaval will be unlike any since colonial times.

""If you end up with a de facto partition of Congo, you set an explosive precedent,"" said a Western diplomat in Kinshasa. ""You basically raise the specter of the breakup of the weaker nation-states in Africa. It's the continent's biggest taboo.""

Since the early 1960s, when colonialism began to crumble, there has been one cardinal understanding among most African statesmen: Tinkering with colonial borders, however nonsensical they might be, invites the dual disasters of border wars and tribal secessions.

Even hard-core pan-Africanists like Tanzania's Julius Nyerere declared that such a course would ""lead us to the tragic absurdity of spending money on armaments while our people die for want of medical attention.""

Corrupt governments and the Cold War have confirmed Nyerere's fears anyway. But it is worth noting that in more than 70 coups in Africa since 1963, none has resulted in the forming of new nations. Eritrea, which became independent in 1993, was a colonial creation.

""The real danger of Congo today is that we are in hangover from the Cold War,"" says Johannes Dawit, the speaker of Ethiopia's parliament. ""Old East-West alignments have collapsed and things are still very unpredictable, in flux. I would expect Africa to be in turmoil for the next 10 years. Sudan could break into three pieces--south, west and north. And Congo could be a detonator.""

Dawit explains that Ethiopia's solution to Africa's lingering instability is ethnic federalism: Major tribal groups have their own schools, television stations and taxes.

But the real tragedy of Congo, with its 250 ethnic groups, is that the problem is reversed.

Just as the Congo River's branching tributaries web the country together with a maze of tropical streams, virtually all Congolese, from a jungle fisherwoman to a European-bred rebel leader, want to preserve their union.

""This was the only good thing [former dictator] Mobutu left us after decades of thievery--we all still call ourselves Congolese,"" says Jean Mpasi-Mazeba, a sad-faced accountant with the government's paralyzed shipping agency.

Mpasi-Mazeba works in a cavernous building smelling of mildew and clogged plumbing that overlooks one of Kinshasa's many idled shipyards. Rusting ferryboats line the city's industrial riverside like beached whale carcasses. All the boats are bloquee-- ""blocked"" by the war. Mpasi-Mazeba uses the same term to describe his own family; like millions of other Kinshasans, he hasn't seen his upstream relatives for more than two years. They are cut off behind rebel lines.

This is how the war grinds on, quietly eroding Congo's 40 brief years of national unity. Already, experts worry that Kabila, if hard pressed by the rebels, will set up a new nation in Katanga, his mineral-rich home province at the river's headwaters. Others foresee United Nations peacekeepers enforcing a de facto partition of Congo along cease-fire lines.

""Every Congolese is against the war,"" says Mowangi, the handicappetrader. ""Even a disgraced man like me.""

A man with a brilliant smile, Mowangi grudgingly admits that war has bolstered his worth as a citizen.

His family abandoned him as a child because of his arms and legs--three of four limbs are like broomsticks, shriveled by polio. No woman will marry him. No restaurant will serve him. But an uncle in the sprawling slums of Kinshasa has taken him in. It is the hard times. The uncle extracts a share of Mowangi's lean trading profits.

The river that swallows all rivers
One of the tallest skyscrapers in Kinshasa is the Ministry of Information. Dominique Sakombi Inongo, the minister, sits in an office on the top floor, and to reach him you must pound with a large stone on the elevator door in the lobby. Sometimes the elevator operator hears. Sometimes he doesn't. If he does, and picks you up, the doors will open on many floors that are completely black, dark as caverns. Sakombi's is not one of them.

""The Congo River,"" says Sakombi, ""is the spinal column of our country. It is a wonderful road. It connects urban to rural. It mixes our cultures and philosophies. It is the basis of our history, and our future.""

Sitting in an office decorated with faux Louis XIV furniture, he tells how the Congo River can meet the hydropower needs of Africa. He explains how the Congo's electricity-generating capacity exceeds all of the rivers and lakes in the continental United States combined. He describes how its original Kikongo name, nzere--""the river that swallows all rivers""--inspired the previous name of the country, Zaire. What he doesn't say is how the stream now also connects the Congolese through widespread misery and death.

According to the United Nations, hundreds of thousands of people have died of war-related violence, disease and hunger in Congo since the fighting erupted in August 1998. Upstream, some 200,000 people are thought to be surviving off wild berries in the jungles of rebel-held eastern Congo alone. In Kinshasa, which is firmly under government control, the toll is more subtle.

With wartime inflation running at more than 500 percent and few civil servants getting paid, Congo's huge capital has become a city of frenetic peddlers. Sweating young men carry trays on their heads piled with sundries, condoms and aspirin, rosaries and razor blades. Two hundred people may stampede toward a passing microbus taxi, because gasoline shortages have paralyzed public transportation.

And on the Congo River, there is only one good business left: smuggling desperate Congolese out to Brazzaville, capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo. The most recent celebrity among these emigrants was Francoise Lumumba, the son of Congo's martyred liberation leader.

Still, Sakombi does not look like the representative of a regime that might spark a terrible new wave of war across Africa. He is an amiable bureaucrat clad in a purple boubous, a traditional robe. If he is preachy, it is because he is famous for two things: He claims to conduct direct conversations with God every day; and he asserts that President Kabila is ruling Congo with divine guidance.

In his previous incarnation as a frontman for former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Sakombi once produced a television commercial that showed the U.S.-backed strongman descending godlike from the clouds.

""What the world calls a rebellion we call an aggression,"" Sakombi says, castigating the United States for not reining in its African allies Rwanda and Uganda, who ignited the war in central Africa.

His billboards, ""Fight for the Reconquest of Congo,"" hector Kinshasans from hundreds of street corners.

But they fool no one.

""There's no military solution to this standoff,"" sighs a senior United Nations official involved in trying to bring peace to Congo. ""The country's just too immense for a clean military victory to ever happen. Except for Rwanda and Angola, who are worried about guerrillas, there's also no legitimate security reason for people to be meddling here. People are just milking the place for diamonds.""

Another UN source who deals frequently with Kabila says: ""He is not really a bad man. He is a revolutionary still trapped in the 1960s who feels he has been chosen by history. He is delusional, intensely paranoid, and the chasm of isolation between he and the people is growing.""

Nobody knows exactly where Kabila, a former guerrilla, sleeps in Kinshasa. He sends decoy motorcades out whenever he travels. Convinced the United Nations wants to assassinate him, he avoids driving past the organization's compound, even though it once lay on the most direct route to the airport.

The lesson of airplanes
An expatriate living in Congo wants to point out the lunacy of post-Cold War conflict in Africa.

""Go to the airport and look at the tails of the airplanes,"" he says.

Miles outside the city, over roads filled with deep pools of fetid rainwater, Ndjili International Airport often looks abandoned except for a motley gaggle of cargo planes parked on a distant tarmac.

Most are Soviet-made Antonovs, the surplus of the Cold War. Many have ""UN"" stenciled on their tails; these are planes chartered by the United Nations to fly high-protein porridge to refugees, or UN peace observers to forward positions as mandated by the Security Council.

A few planes have the faint outlines of ""UN"" on their tails where the international organization's logo has been stripped off; these are former mercy planes now contracted to fly arms and ammunition to Kabila's troops.

Ukrainian pilots fly both types of planes. Identical planes also are flown by Ukrainian mercenaries on the rebel side.

""The Ukrainians have privatized the war,"" the expatriate says, laughing. ""And best of all, they also sit on the Security Council at the UN!""

Who will save Congo?
One day, a Kinshasa newspaper carries a letter from a reader titled, ""More Than 500 Barriers Erected to Hold the Ship Owners at Ransom.""

The letter says: ""So what is happening on the Congo River? Impossible to go one step forward without encountering the Security Forces. They search everything. The aim of the search is only to be able to steal as much as possible. For each step forward there is a tax or a fine. This does not go to the State but to the pockets of the strongest ones.""

The letter goes on describe how ship captains are robbed of cassava roots, fish and other food at 500 separate checkpoints between Kinshasa and Mbandaka, a front-line town some 350 miles upstream.

In fact, traffic on the Congo River has been all but paralyzed by the war. The mad gantlets run by Mowangi, the invalid trader--15-minute journeys across the stream to neighboring Brazzaville--are the only regular passenger routes still active on one of the world's most magnificent waterways. No other river in the world is as constant as the Congo; it crosses the equator not once, but twice, and its currents absorb runoff from two alternating wet seasons, two hemispheres.

The letter writer concludes with Congolese hyperbole: ""To say the least the [Democratic Republic of Congo] is a country where great ideas are born but not enjoyed by anyone ... Imagination prevails over reality. Reason is offending to governments. Who will save Congo?""

In the exclusive, hilly neighborhoods of Kinshasa where the technocrats of Kabila have replaced those of Mobutu, and from where the Congo River seems like a distant blade of sky, Christophe Gbenye says he has the answer to that question: Who will save Congo?

""My party,"" says Gbenye, the general secretary of the Congolese National Movement-Lumumbist, the direct descendant of the party founded by Congo's liberation leader Lumumba. ""Kabila has no vision whatsoever. He was a professional rebel, living in Tanzanian hotels. He does not know how to run a country or a war.""

Gbenye, sitting under a thatched gazebo equipped with a bar and an espresso machine, repeats what everyone in Kinshasa says: Kabila is prolonging the war because he will not survive a free election in a peaceful Congo. Kabila has squandered his goodwill since installing himself as president in 1997. He has suppressed the press and banned all political parties. He has postponed elections indefinitely. He has set up a sham parliament with hand-picked deputies.

Gbenye compares the biggest war in Africa to a crystal--a perfect latticework of interlocking interests that make the violence and chaos unscratchable, like a diamond.

Angola wants its borders secure from guerrillas, so it supports Kabila in exchange for allowing Angolan troops in Congo. Zimbabwe and Namibia are reported to be tapping diamond mines in exchange for their help. Rwanda and its ally Uganda will never pull out of the rebel-held east until the Hutu militias that committed the 1994 Rwandan genocide are neutralized there.

""To get all these foreigners out, to solve this puzzle, to keep this disease from spreading to the rest of Africa, it will take a new generation of Congolese leaders,"" says Gbenye. But he is not one of them.

His party, inactive now like all the opposition in Congo, is widely regarded as having been co-opted by Kabila. And then there is his past. Gbenye led the Simba rebel movement in the 1960s, an army whose fighters dressed in monkey skins and cannibalized their opponents. In the eastern city of Kisangani, he once took 800 white hostages and threatened to burn them alive.

Gbenye, a courtly man in a blue flowered shirt, says that today he is a vegetarian and a devout Catholic.

A gift for the dead
Mowangi, the river trader, doesn't know much about politics. None of the people crowded into his uncle's compound in the slums of Kinshasa can afford a newspaper. For them, the war is this: Of 35 people packed into the dusty clutch of huts and houses, only two have jobs. And everything costs money these days in Kinshasa.

School students must pay their teachers to have each of their tests graded. A woman giving birth is held as collateral in Kinshasa's dilapidated hospital until her family ponies up a set of chairs, or perhaps the family television set.

Mowangi is one of the two lucky people among his relatives who enjoys steady work. Usually, a cousin pushes him and his wheelchair the 6 miles to the waterfront. He carries a few boxes of soap over the Congo River, or some biscuits perhaps, for a weekly income of about $15.

Mowangi does not like the Congo River. He once saw a handicappe fall into the stream. The man and his wheelchair sank immediately. In compensation, the ferryboat captain paid a small cadeau, or gift, to thehandicappe traders union.

A message to the world
While peacemakers from the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity circle Congo warily, smelling a quagmire bigger than the size of many subcontinents, 50 million Congolese wait. They grow gaunt. They die. Many leave; the most popular television show in Kinshasa is a music program featuring Congolese emigrants partying in Belgian clubs.

But some of Congo's people, thrust unwillingly into a volcanic war rumbling in Africa's center, have refused to fade away. They do not want to become invisible, like the handicappes.

In August, 44 followers of Bernard Mizele Nsima, a wizened old preacher who calls himself the King of Kongo, walked into government offices in Kinshasa and delivered 44 identical letters addressed to Kabila. The president, the letters intoned, was to resign immediately and pass power to Mizele, a divine king.

The royal subjects of the so-called Kingdom of Kongo were hauled off to jail. Mizele was arrested at 3 a.m. the next day, in a police raid on his house.

""The police asked him to give up his demands,"" says Basakinina Mbelolo, an unemployed engineer who is a minister in Mizele's fantasy kingdom. ""He said he couldn't; he had his vision from God.""

Today the self-anointed king sits in prison, apparently waiting for another chance to grasp his destiny.

The old man's followers had staged a similar phantom coup once before. During their 1998 trial on charges of subversion--a showcase for the hairline cracks appearing in the surface of Congo's battered nationhood--King Mizele laid out his plans to carve a secessionist empire from Congo that included Kinshasa and two western provinces. He already had appointed family members to imaginary government posts. Today, thousands of his followers still carry his kingdom's identity cards.

""We want you to deliver a message to the world about these matters,"" says Mbelolo, the king's spokesman. ""There are great injustices here.""

Mbelolo, a dapper man, borrows money to photocopy his kingdom's manifesto to the world. But after disappearing into the clogged, dusty, sweltering streets of Kinshasa, he never returns.

It is perhaps just as well.

The original Kingdom of Kongo, an empire with a complex system of taxes and fiefs that flourished on the lower reaches of the Congo River in the 15th Century, had no luck eliciting either attention or pity from of the world beyond Africa.

""My Lord, a monstrous greed pushes our subjects, even Christians, to seize members of their own families, and of ours, to do business by selling them as captives,"" King Nzinga Mbemna Affonso, the kingdom's first missionized monarch, wrote his counterpart in Portugal.

King Affonso, the first African leader to enter into correspondence with civilizations beyond the continent, was watching his lands being plundered by Portuguese slavers. He wrote beautiful letters requesting the intercession of several European courts. No answers ever came. Instead his pleas spilled, as the Congo River still does, into a vast ocean of silence.

The Congo is a strong if pitiless stream. Today, cargo ship captains report that the red silts of Africa's heart can be seen some 30 miles out into the Atlantic."
61,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"The day before Chen Zixiu died, her captors again demanded that she renounce her faith in Falun Dafa. Barely conscious after repeated jolts from a cattle prod, the 58-year-old stubbornly shook her head.

Enraged, the local officials ordered Ms. Chen to run barefoot in the snow. Two days of torture had left her legs bruised and her short black hair matted with pus and blood, said cellmates and other prisoners who witnessed the incident. She crawled outside, vomited and collapsed. She never regained consciousness, and died on Feb. 21.

A year ago, few outside of China had heard of Falun Dafa and its regimen of practices, known as Falun Gong, which include breathing exercises, meditation and readings from the moralistic, and sometimes unusual, works of group founder Li Hongzhi.

Although popular among millions of Chinese, Falun Gong didn't jump to international prominence until April 25 last year, when 10,000 of its believers converged on Beijing, surrounding the government's leadership compound in the Forbidden City and demanding an end to state press reports that portrayed them as a superstitious cult. The crowd cut an odd sight: Mostly middle-age, working-class people, they simply meditated quietly for the better part of a day before leaving the center of town to return to their homes across the country.

But to a government that doesn't much tolerate open challenges to its power, the protest was an unforgivable provocation. The government arrested hundreds of Falun Gong organizers and discovered that some were officials in the central government, the police and even the military. Worried that a cancerous religion was infecting its atheist state, Beijing declared Falun Gong an ""evil cult"" last July and formally banned it.

Confronted with the full weight of China's security apparatus, Falun Gong should have died a quick death. But unlike the dissidents who occasionally challenge the Communist Party, Falun Gong activists haven't been stopped, despite mass arrests, beatings and even killings. Instead, a hard core continues to protest, with several dozen arrested every day in downtown Beijing when they try to unfurl banners calling for their group's legalization. A year on, Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule.

Ms. Chen's tale is one of extremes. On one end is the Communist Party, which is so determined to break Falun Gong that it has resorted to public-security measures on a scale not seen since 1989, when an antigovernment movement led by students was crushed in Tiananmen Square. The government's victory in this fight, should it come, may well be Pyrrhic; its heavy-handed approach has disillusioned millions of ordinary people, such as Ms. Chen's daughter, who were apolitical until last year's events. It has also damaged China's international standing just as it needs foreign help on an array of pressing economic issues.

On the other end are people such as Ms. Chen, who in their simple, and perhaps naive, way are at the forefront of a slow trend to demand the freedoms guaranteed by China's laws and constitution. While many Falun Gong practitioners have compromised -- by practicing secretly at home, for example -- thousands have insisted openly on their right to freedom of belief and assembly. ""We're good people,"" Ms. Chen's friends recall her telling officials from the Weifang city government who interrogated her in her barren concrete cell two days before she died. ""Why shouldn't we practice what we want?""

The story of Ms. Chen's last days is reconstructed from interviews with family, friends and prisoners, as well as two accounts written by cellmates and smuggled out of jail in recent weeks. Originals of these accounts were examined and shown to the authors' friends and relatives, who verified the documents as having been written by their loved ones.

Allegations of mistreatment also are backed by more than two dozen separate interviews with Falun Gong adherents in other cities, who independently said they too were beaten with clubs and electric batons, chained to bars and made to disavow their faith.

Local officials rejected efforts to interview them for this story, while Beijing's official position on all allegations of prison abuse is that no Falun Gong practitioner has been mistreated in custody. It says 35,000 adherents came to Beijing but were sent back safely, with only three dying accidentally when they tried to escape. International human-rights groups say it is likely that at least seven more deaths like Ms. Chen's occurred through mistreatment in prison.

""All she had to do was say she renounced Falun Gong and they would have let her go,"" said Zhang Xueling, Ms. Chen's 32-year-old daughter. ""But she refused.""

Three years ago, Ms. Chen hardly imagined that she would be risking her life by practicing Falun Gong . She was 55 and had taken early retirement from a state-run truck-repair garage where she had worked for 30 years making auto parts. One day while out walking in the neighborhood near her family's one-story brick bungalow, Ms. Chen noticed some practitioners of Falun Gong. A widow for 20 years whose children were grown, Ms. Chen had little to do during the day, so she started attending the exercise sessions regularly.

""My mother was never anyone who believed in superstitious things,"" said Ms. Zhang, who doesn't practice Falun Gong herself. ""Frankly, she had a bad temper because she felt she was getting old and had sacrificed so much to raise us alone. When she joined Falun Gong her temper improved a lot and she became a better person. We really supported her.""

Over the next two years, Ms. Chen became an enthusiastic participant, rising at 4:30 a.m. to exercise for 90 minutes in a small dirt lot with half a dozen other practitioners. After a day running errands for her children and grandchildren, Ms. Chen spent evenings reading the works of Mr. Li, the group's founder, and discussing his ideas with fellow members. Those beliefs incorporate traditional morality -- do good works, speak honestly, never be evasive -- as well as some idiosyncratic notions, such as the existence of extraterrestrial life and separate-but-equal heavens for people of different races.

Gradually, Falun Gong gained adherents in her neighborhood, Xu Family Hamlet, which is located in an industrial suburb of Weifang, a city of 1.3 million in eastern China's Shandong province. The hamlet is a dusty maze of poplar-lined dirt roads and bungalows surrounded by crumbling brown brick walls -- a typical village being swallowed up by its urban neighbor. By last year, her local group had doubled in size to a dozen regular members -- hardly a giant organization, but a regular presence in the community.

For Ms. Chen, China's decision to ban Falun Gong last July came out of the blue. She hadn't noticed the articles and television shows that had attacked the group, and she paid little attention a year ago when members surrounded the Communist Party's leadership compound in Beijing. The day the government ban was announced ""was the bitterest of her life,"" said her daughter, Ms. Zhang. ""She couldn't accept that they were criticizing Falun Gong and calling it an evil cult.""

Although barely literate and never before interested in politics, Ms. Chen resisted the ban. She invited group members to practice at her home and refused to deny her affiliation with the group or her love for Mr. Li, whom she respectfully called ""Master Li.""

Then, last November, several top organizers of Falun Gong were given long prison sentences. Shocked, Ms. Chen joined thousands of fellow practitioners by traveling to Beijing with the vague idea of protesting against the government. Since the ban in July, many had gone to Tiananmen Square and sat cross-legged with their arms stretched in an arc over their heads -- the classic starting pose for Falun Gong exercises.

Ms. Chen never made it that far. On Dec. 4, the day after she arrived in Beijing, she was walking through the Temple of Heaven park when a plain-clothes security agent asked if she was a member. She answered truthfully and was arrested, her daughter said.

She was taken to the Weifang municipal government's Beijing representative office, a sort of lobbying bureau-cum-dormitory that scores of Chinese cities and provinces have set up in the capital to house local officials visiting Beijing.

The next day, Ms. Zhang and three local officials made the seven-hour drive to Beijing to pick up Ms. Chen, a humiliation for the officials, who were criticized for not keeping better control of their people. Ms. Zhang paid the equivalent of a $60 fine -- a month's wages -- and returned home with her mother, who complained that police had confiscated the $75 in cash she had brought with her.

As punishment, officials from the Chengguan Street Committee (street committees are the lowest level in China's system of government) confined Ms. Chen to their offices, just 200 yards from her home. She stayed there for two weeks, in a form of ""administrative detention"" that the state can impose almost indefinitely. Ms. Zhang had to pay another $45 for her mother's room and board.

On Jan. 3, Ms. Chen celebrated her 58th birthday. Despite being under day-and-night observation, she was in great spirits, Ms. Zhang said. ""She knew she was right. All she wanted was to make the government not make a criminal out of her because she knew she wasn't a criminal.""

Then, on Chinese New Year, which this year fell on Feb. 4, hundreds of Falun Gong protesters were arrested and beaten in Beijing. (Though no longer under surveillance, Ms. Chen wasn't a protester.) Officials in the capital were stunned by the outbreak. On Feb. 16, the local district chief came to see Ms. Chen and told her that Beijing wanted to make sure no other Falun Gong adherents went to Beijing, especially since China's annual session of parliament was due to begin in a few days. He asked Ms. Chen to promise she wouldn't leave home.

""My mother told them very clearly that she wouldn't guarantee that she wouldn't go anywhere. She said she had the right to go where she pleased,"" Ms. Zhang said. The officials left in a huff.

Two days later, Ms. Zhang came home to find half a dozen officials in her living room. They said her mother had been spotted outside by a special squad of informants who roamed the neighborhood looking for Falun Gong participants who dared to leave home.

Ms. Chen was taken into custody and never seen by her daughter again. She was held for a day in the Chengguan Street Committee offices, but then during the night she managed to escape -- exactly how isn't clear, officials told Ms. Zhang. Ms. Chen was arrested the next day, Feb. 17, heading for the train station, apparently hoping to go to Beijing to plead her case before the Petitions and Appeals Office, a last resort for people who feel they have been wronged.

This time, officials from the local district Communist Party office sent Ms. Chen to a small, unofficial prison run by the street committee, described to practitioners as the Falun Gong Education Study Class.

People who have been held there describe it as more of a torture chamber. The building is two stories with a yard in the middle. In the corner of the yard is a squat one-story building with two rooms. This is where beatings took place, according to four detainees who described the building in separate accounts.

While Ms. Chen was transferred to the detention center, officials called Ms. Zhang and said her mother would be released if she would pay a $241 fine. Ms. Zhang was fed up with the government's ""fines"" and, she said, her mother's insistence on standing up for her rights. She told the officials that their fines were illegal and that she would complain to the local procurator's office if they didn't release her mother. She rejected another call on Feb.18 and again threatened legal action, though she didn't follow through.

Meanwhile, Ms. Chen spent a night in the jail, listening to screams emanating from the squat building, according to two of her cellmates. Before she was led in, she was allowed another phone call. She called her daughter later on the 18th and asked her to bring the money. Irritated by the troubles brought on by her mother's uncompromising attitude, Ms. Zhang argued with her. Give in and come home, the daughter pleaded. Her mother quietly refused.

Ms. Chen's ordeal began that night. Wrote an adherent who was in the next room of the squat building: ""We heard her screaming. Our hearts were tortured and our spirits almost collapsed."" Officials from the Chengguan Street Committee used plastic truncheons on her calves, feet and lower back, as well as a cattle prod on her head and neck, according to witnesses. They shouted at her repeatedly to give up Falun Gong and to curse Mr. Li, according to her cellmates. Each time, Ms. Chen refused.

The next day, the 19th, Ms. Zhang got another call. Bring the money, she was told. Ms. Zhang hesitated. Her mother came on the line. Her voice, usually so strong and confident, was soft and pained. She pleaded with her daughter to bring the money. The caller came back on the phone. Bring the money, she said.

Ms. Zhang got a sick feeling and rushed over with the money and some clothes. But the building was surrounded by agents who wouldn't let her see her mother. Suspicious that this was a ruse to get more money from her -- and that her mother wasn't really in the building at all -- she returned home. An hour later, a practitioner came to see Ms. Zhang. Falun Gong adherents were being beaten in the center, she was told.

Ms. Zhang raced back with her brother, carrying fruit as a small bribe for the police. She was refused entrance and her money was refused as well. She noticed an old woman in a room and shouted up to her: ""Is my mother being beaten?"" The old woman waved her hand to signify ""no,"" although Ms. Zhang wondered whether she might have been trying to wave her away from the prison, fearing she, too, would be arrested. Ms. Zhang and her brother went home for a fitful, sleepless night.

That night, Ms. Chen was taken back into the room. After again refusing to give up Falun Gong, she was beaten and jolted with the stun stick, according to two prisoners who heard the incident and one who caught glimpses of it through a door. Her cellmates heard her curse the officials, saying the central government would punish them once they were exposed. But in an answer that Falun Gong adherents say they heard repeatedly in different parts of the country, the Weifang officials told Ms. Chen that they had been told by the central government that ""no measures are too excessive"" to wipe out Falun Gong. The beatings continued and would stop only when Ms. Chen changed her thinking, according to two prisoners who say they overheard the incident.

Two hours after she went in, Ms. Chen was pushed back into her cell on the second story of the main building, an unheated room with only a sheet of steel for a bed. Her three cellmates tended to her wounds, but she fell into a delirium. One of the cellmates remembers her moaning ""mommy, mommy.""

The next morning, the 20th, she was ordered out to jog. ""I saw from the window that she crawled out with difficulty,"" wrote a cellmate in a letter smuggled out by her husband. Ms. Chen collapsed and was dragged back into the cell.

""I was a medical major. When I saw her dying, I suggested moving her into another [heated] room,"" the cellmate wrote in her letter. Instead, local government officials gave her ""sanqi,"" herbal pills for light internal bleeding. ""But she couldn't swallow and spat them out."" Cellmates implored the officials to send Ms. Chen to a hospital, but the officials -- who often criticize Falun Gong practitioners for forgoing modern medical treatment in favor of a superstitious belief in their exercises -- refused, her cellmates said. Eventually they brought in a doctor, who pronounced her healthy.

But, wrote the cellmate: ""She wasn't conscious and didn't talk, and only spat dark-colored sticky liquid. We guessed it was blood. Only the next morning did they confirm that she's dying."" An employee of the local Public Security Bureau, Liu Guangming, ""tried her pulse and his face froze."" Ms. Chen was dead.

That evening, officials went over to Ms. Zhang's house and said her mother was ill, according to Ms. Zhang and her brother. The two piled into a car and were driven to a hotel about a mile from the detention center. The hotel was surrounded by police. The local party secretary told them Ms. Chen had died of a heart attack, but they wouldn't allow them to see her body. After hours of arguing, the officials finally said they could see the body, but only the next day, and insisted they spend the night in the heavily guarded hotel. The siblings refused and finally were allowed to go home.

On the 22nd, Ms. Zhang and her brother were taken to the local hospital, which was also ringed by police. Their mother, they recalled, was laid out on a table in traditional mourning garb: a simple blue cotton tunic over pants. In a bag tossed in the corner of the room, Ms. Zhang said she spotted her mother's torn and bloodied clothes, the underwear badly soiled. Her calves were black. Six-inch welts streaked along her back. Her teeth were broken. Her ear was swollen and blue. Ms. Zhang fainted, and her brother, weeping, caught her.

That day, the hospital issued a report on Ms. Chen. It said the cause of death was natural. The hospital declines to comment on the matter. Ms. Zhang said she challenged officials about the clothing she had seen, but they told her her mother had become incontinent after the heart attack and that was why her clothes were soiled.

Ms. Zhang and her brother tried filing a lawsuit, but no lawyer would accept the case. Meantime, her mother's body lay in refrigeration, until the threatened litigation was resolved.

Then, on March 17, Ms. Zhang received a letter from the hospital saying the body would be cremated that day. Ms. Zhang called the hospital to try to prevent it, but she said officials didn't give her a clear answer and said they would have to call her back. They didn't. Ms. Zhang never saw her mother's body again."
62,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"It's 9 a.m., and Mei Yulan looks distinctly down at heel, having spent the third night in a row walking the chilly April streets of China's capital, waiting for today to arrive.

When it does, the 44-year-old farmer knows what she will do. Like scores of fellow adherents of Falun Dafa, Ms. Mei will head to Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing and proclaim the innocence of her sect in hopes the government will legalize the group. Before she gets to utter a word, she expects to be arrested and whisked away to face days, months or years of incarceration or hard labor.

Indeed, early Tuesday, police had established a tight cordon around the square and were asking people coming out of subways and off buses if they were Falun Dafa adherents. At least a dozen were detained by 8 a.m.

It is a fate more than 30,000 have faced over the past year as the group, which practices a form of meditation and exercises, has intensified its struggle with Beijing to gain legitimacy. China, however, shows no sign of bending, insisting that Falun Dafa believers are being duped by an ""evil cult"" that has cheated members of money and whose emphasis on prayer over science has led to thousands of deaths due to lack of medical care.

The battle was joined exactly a year ago, when roughly 10,000 Falun Dafa practitioners surrounded the downtown leadership compound of the Communist Party, demanding an end to what they said was biased coverage of their group in the state media. Local television stations and newspapers had been criticizing the group as ""superstitious"" -- a word in communist parlance indicating the group soon would be banned.

 

Last year's protest hastened its fate. Shocked by the well-organized demonstration, the government arrested top Falun Dafa leaders, banned the group in July and then promulgated a law barring cults. Yet each step has only caused more protests, which have been met by increasingly harsh police treatment. Human-rights groups say it is likely more than a dozen believers have died of police brutality in prison, while thousands of others like Ms. Mei have been beaten or tortured, many with clubs and electric batons.

To an outsider, Ms. Mei's willingness to face almost certain rearrest seems like zealotry. No one compels her or her fellow believers to go downtown; indeed, many Falun Dafa adherents appear able to continue to practice their faith at home.

The mother of two girls sees it differently. She regards it as her duty to proclaim the group's innocence and, through a steady battle of wills, to force the government to change its mind. While she might not put it in such words, she behaves like a martyr for her new religion, relying on faith to justify her actions. ""All 11 members of my family have been arrested,"" she says, recounting her story in a taxi being driven by a Falun Dafa believer.

""We're ready for any sacrifice.""

Sitting beside her is her 75-year-old mother-in-law, who explains in her thick native Henan accent how she, too, was beaten in police custody two weeks ago. Local authorities, the women say, were trying to make them renounce their belief so they wouldn't travel to Beijing for the anniversary. One official whacked away at both women's calves with a plastic truncheon, they say, and they roll up their thick blue cotton trousers to show dark-blue and black bruises.

Authorities say the claims of police abuse are an effort to smear the government, but the accounts are detailed and often corroborated by Falun Dafa members in other cities, who tell of similar efforts by officials to torture believers into submission.

""When I was arrested two weeks ago,"" Ms. Mei says, ""police pulled my head back with my hair and asked me to give up Falun Gong,"" as the practice is also called. ""I said no, and then they told me to sit cross-legged. Then they trod on my feet until I screamed in pain.""

After 10 days, Ms. Mei was released when she promised not to go to Beijing. She left the next day and was initially put up in the homes of local Falun Dafa believers. As the anniversary approached, many of these benefactors were detained -- her most recent host was picked up while Ms. Mei was out buying vegetables in the market. She spied police cars ringing the apartment building and fled, leaving her belongings behind. Since then, she has wandered the city and slept outside, wary of the police who scour Beijing for vagrant Falun Dafa believers.

In addition to exercises and meditation, Falun Dafa's practices include readings from the moralistic, and sometimes controversial, works of group founder Li Hongzhi. The group says it is apolitical; China's leaders see its protests as a threat.

Residents here say the police have targeted city dwellers first, hoping to make it difficult for outsiders like Ms. Mei to survive in Beijing. Zhang Yuxiang, a 36-year-old unemployed accountant, was last arrested Feb. 4 when she tried to go to Tiananmen Square on the eve of the Chinese New Year. Like many local residents, she was taken to the Chaoyang District Jail, where she says she was locked into Room 602 for a week of increasingly humiliating treatment.

First, she says, she was slapped and beaten several times. Then, when none of the 15 Falun Dafa believers in her cell repented, she was singled out as the cell's ringleader because she happened to be standing in front of the cell when a warden came by to see the recalcitrant prisoners.

Two other prisoners, interviewed separately, confirm her story: After the warden left, a female prison guard ordered Ms. Zhang to give up Falun Dafa. When she refused, the guard ordered her to strip and kneel naked before her on the concrete floor. The guard poured bucket after bucket of water on Ms. Zhang, each time ordering her to give up Falun Dafa. But each of the five times, Ms. Zhang refused, even as she started shaking from the cold in the poorly heated cell."

64,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"A United Nations committee issued a report yesterday that finds China at fault for an array of practices that contribute to torture.

The five-page report by the UN Committee Against Torture concluded a regular session monitoring China's compliance with an international treaty that outlaws torture. The panel said that while China has made progress in some areas of legal reform, it continues to condone practices that can lead directly to police abuse.

The carefully worded document came after hearings last week at which committee members grilled China on its record of police brutality. The committee, which usually looks at systemic problems leading to torture, such as lack of police training, took the unusual step of bringing up a specific case -- that of Chen Zixiu, who was reportedly beaten to death in an unofficial police cell earlier this year. Her case was the subject of a page one Wall Street Journal article last month.

Chinese delegates rebutted the charges before the committee that Ms. Chen had died in police custody, saying she had died of a heart attack.

Although yesterday's final report did not bring up Ms. Chen's case, it noted that ""reforms are not implemented uniformly and equally in all parts of China,"" a reference to the excessive zeal sometimes used by police officers in forcing confessions from prisoners.

Ms. Chen reportedly died after government employees beat her for refusing to renounce her belief in Falun Dafa, an exercise and meditation regime that the government has banned as a dangerous cult that fleeces naive participants and practices mind control.

The panel also recommended that prisoners have a right to a lawyer. They must now ask for permission to see one, and many Falun Dafa detainees say they have been refused.

One of the strongest recommendations is that China ""consider abolishing,in accordance with relevant international standards, all forms of administrative detention,"" a form of imprisonment that doesn't require filing of charges, legal hearings or trials, and can be extended almost indefinitely. Ms. Chen's daughter was held for 15 days in such detention for ""disturbing social order"" by publicizing her view that her mother died of torture.

The committee noted some progress made in the nation's legal system, such as an assurance from China that the torture treaty is legally binding on its law-enforcement and judicial organs. It also said China had tried to introduce fair trials for prisoners being considered for ""re-education through labor,"" one of the harshest punishments in China.

Although the UN has no direct way to enforce the treaty, the periodic monitoring holds China to unusual scrutiny."
65,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"On a hazy July morning, Li Guoqiang starts out on his bike toward Tiananmen Square.

It's two weeks before the July 22 anniversary of the government's ban on the Falun Dafa movement, which authorities consider an evil religious cult.Mr. Li knows that scores of out-of-town adherents will descend on Beijing to protest against the crackdown, and he plans to extend help to any who ask for it. He takes it upon himself this day to scout out the sprawling square so that he can provide information on the likely police presence there,especially plainclothes officers.

""This is my own idea,"" Mr. Li says as he sets out on a two-hour ride that will be punctuated by pager messages from members of Falun Dafa's nationwide network of activists requesting help. ""Everyone decides for themselves how to be of most use. This is something I can do.""

As the campaign against Falun Dafa enters its second year, many wonder how the group has withstood the government's security onslaught. The crackdown has involved a deployment of uniformed and undercover security agents not seen since the massacre of antigovernment protesters near Tiananmen Square 11 years ago.

Yet Falun Dafa is staying a step ahead, thanks to a well-functioning ad hoc network that depends on informal links among adherents using pagers and pay phones. One of those links is Mr. Li, an unemployed accountant whose efforts to keep Falun Dafa alive have earned him the affectionate nickname of Brother Li among adherents.

Falun Dafa maintains that it isn't a religion but an organization that promotes good health through breathing exercises called Falun Gong and good morals. The moral precepts come from founder Li Hongzhi, who lives in the U.S. and isn't related to Brother Li.

Authorities accuse the group of being a tightly organized movement that uses a ""second echelon"" of organizers like Brother Li to keep the group alive. Claiming that Falun Dafa's advocacy of exercise over medicine led to 1,500 deaths, the government has tried to smash this structure by rounding up all of the group's known leaders in China and thousands of other members. Had Falun Dafa been one of the dissident groups that occasionally spring up to promote democracy, the display of force would have been more than enough to crush it.

But Falun Dafa is more complex than authorities in Beijing imagine. Made up of very loose cells linked by interchangeable volunteers, it has demonstrated a remarkable ability to inspire ordinary followers to give up their jobs and their freedom to fill in for arrested leaders and followers.

During the past year, Brother Li and others also have learned how to cope with the Communist Party's security apparatus. Experience has taught them to shun cellular phones and e-mail as too easily monitored. Two decades of change in China mean that they also can take advantage of housing that is outside the party's authority, tap private, unregistered cabbies who take orders from no one, and exploit the general confusion of a country where the party can no longer control everything.

As Tiananmen Square comes in sight, Brother Li's beeper goes off. It's a message to call a pay phone in Beijing. Brother Li angles his one-speed black bike over to the curb and stops in front of a bank of pay phones as a wave of cyclists rushes past. All the phones are occupied.

Experience quells the temptation to turn on his cell phone. Not only can conversations be monitored, but the phones are dangerous even when they are only switched on. That's because security agents can figure out which transmitter the phone is getting its signal from. In a city like Beijing, where a high density of mobile phones means transmitters are located every few blocks,police could trace Brother Li and follow him through town.

A few weeks earlier, one of Brother Li's associates was almost nabbed when he used a mobile phone to set up a meeting. A novice to the group's security measures, he arrived at the rendezvous point to find the area crawling with suspicious people. Although he jumped into a cab and left, the two followers he was supposed to meet were detained.

Finally, a public phone is free and Brother Li calls. From the receiver comes an excited voice -- a Falun Dafa practitioner from northeastern China who has traveled to the capital to find someone to help her send an e-mail to the outside world. Identifying herself only as Ms. Chen, she alleges that a teenage Falun Dafa believer died when she tried to escape police by leaping from a train. Like many Falun Dafa newcomers to the city, Ms. Chen has heard of Brother Li through a friend of a friend. Brother Li has no idea who she is, but after talking to her for a while, he figures she isn't a police plant. He agrees to meet later in the day.

""You can usually tell if the people are genuine,"" he says, hopping on his bike and heading back down the road in the stifling heat. ""They make references to things that the police wouldn't know about and have this earnest air about them.""

Ms. Chen, who spent the previous night outside in a park, is desperate for accommodations. Practitioners used to stay with Brother Li, but his three-room apartment in Beijing's eastern district is sometimes watched by security agents. Like most people who have continued to practice Falun Dafa during the year since the crackdown, Ms. Chen was fired from her job and has little money. Most followers can survive in costly Beijing only through the generosity of fellow practitioners.

Fortunately for Brother Li, housing in China is no longer strictly controlled by the party. Just a few years ago, all housing was allocated by government-controlled ""work units,"" and busybody cleaning ladies sat in elevators, noting who came and went. Now, housing is starting to be sold commercially, people are moving around, and no one is exactly sure who lives where. A fellow Falun Dafa adherent who worked for a textile company has an extra apartment and Brother Li is fairly certain Ms. Chen can stay there without anyone's noticing.

As he pedals across the north end of Tiananmen Square, Brother Li is hard to distinguish from the thousands of other cyclists. Wearing a striped short-sleeve shirt and black polyester pants, he cuts a trim figure, his face often breaking out into a broad, easy smile. But then his eyes, usually languid and distant, suddenly light up. ""There and there,"" he says, making mental notes. ""The police are all along the entrances to the pedestrian underpasses.""

A day after his reconnaissance trip, Brother Li is cycling past Workers Stadium in Beijing in search of a pay phone that he hasn't used. He worries that if he regularly calls from the same public phones near home, undercover police, who occasionally follow him, will notice and start bugging those as well.

His beeper goes off and he pulls over to make a call. It's an adherent from Guangdong province in the south who had been in Beijing helping people from her region survive in the distant capital, with its incomprehensible dialect and tight security. The woman debated going to Tiananmen Square to protest -- an act that always winds up with arrest and detention without charge. In the end, she decided she was needed more in Guangdong, where she can function as a link to the capital.

 

Before the crackdown, Falun Dafa had a more elaborate organizational structure. It had ""general assistance centers,"" usually in each province, and ""assistance centers"" in cities. It also had ""assistants"" who helped teach the slow-motion exercises, sold cassettes and books and reserved space in public parks where adherents met to exercise. The old structure was quickly broken by the Public Security Bureau. Moles inside the group gave security agents lists of assistants, who were quickly rounded up and jailed, with some given sentences of as long as 15 years.

The new structure, which depends on ordinary followers keeping in touch with one another, is much more resilient. If the woman in Guangdong gets arrested, as she has on several occasions, Brother Li has alternative contacts down south to call. Likewise, if he is arrested, believers can reach other Beijing activists -- phone lists are widely shared and passed on to trusted followers.

Most of the contact between regions is to exchange basic intelligence --where police are active and who is out of jail and can be reached. Members also exchange stories of police abuse and protests to bolster their spirits. At a meeting with Brother Li before heading back, the woman from Guangdong, a 32-year-old unemployed English teacher with a pale face and a tiny voice, explains herself: ""Many followers need to be reminded that others are protesting. This will give them courage.""

Now she's calling to say she has made it back safely and to ask for any news. Brother Li relates that demonstrations have been going on daily, even if on some days only a few make it to Tiananmen Square. He's using a pay phone in a kiosk, and with the vendor listening to his end of the conversation, he doesn't speak too explicitly. ""We've still got a lot of friends visiting town. We're still very active,"" Brother Li says. ""Let everyone know we're fine in Beijing.""

He hangs up and continues on. He's now passing through the capital's bar district, a narrow street lined with pubs called Durty Nellie's and Nashville and, at night, with prostitutes and revelers. In his mind, the risks he takes are worthwhile because his faith stands in direct contrast to this moral decay. He feels he is part of an effort to restore standards that decades of Communist attacks on people's beliefs have destroyed.

Not too long ago, Mr. Li gave little thought to such spiritual matters, striving for the promotions and business trips abroad that define success in modern China. He worked as an accountant at a textile mill, got married and had a son, who is now 12. Then he heard about Falun Dafa early last year, and he began to practice, at first out of curiosity but then with increasing fervor.

Last October, Brother Li was suddenly forced to decide how much Falun Dafa meant to him. Worried about pressure from its government masters, managers at his state-owned mill told him that he should stop practicing. The decision, he says, was easy: He quit, and since then has occupied his time with odd jobs and with helping the movement survive.

Now living on a monthly $40 stipend from the local welfare office, he says he reminds himself of the famous Chinese aphorism: ""The great hermit lives in the city."" Accordingly, he has stripped his life down to the simplest of clothes and only one luxury: a pair of dark wraparound sunglasses against the burning summer sun. Pagers are cheap here, and so are phone calls. He bought his cell phone, which he rarely uses now, when he had a job. With his wife's salary as a clerk in a factory, the Li family just makes ends meet.

""We live in a bad world, one that needs good people who believe in doing good deeds,"" Brother Li says quietly, embarrassed at having to explain his beliefs. ""Life is a test to see if you can be a good person.""

He is interrupted again by his pager. It's another follower from Guangdong province who needs a fellow believer picked up at the airport. Brother Li quickly calls a Falun Dafa member who drives an unregistered cab – one of the thousands of such private taxis that have sprung up in recent years. The cabbie agrees to take the airport passenger without charging; another small task done.

Arrest is always on Brother Li's mind. To minimize risk, he follows a few basic rules. Meetings with adherents last just a few minutes. Calls are clipped and ambiguous. Information is exchanged only in person. Pagers are changed as often as he can afford -- he has had three in the past four months --because if the police discover his account number, they can find out what calls are on his account.

But lying is considered morally wrong, so members rarely deny adhering to Falun Dafa. Many are arrested when police simply ask them their affiliation. It isn't unusual, for example, for practitioners who have spent their last penny traveling to Beijing to protest to be thwarted just a few feet away from Tiananmen Square by a police officer's simple question: ""Are you a member of Falun Dafa?""

After finding a few pay phones and noting their location for future use, Mr. Li heads home. The temperature is over 100 degrees, and even Mr. Li, usually so cool and calm, starts sweating.

For two days now, he has been agonizing over whether he should go to Tiananmen Square to protest. In some ways, a key weapon that Falun Dafa practitioners have in their battle against the Public Security Bureau is the randomness of their actions. While protests increase in intensity around certain anniversaries, protesters go to the square almost daily, driven by the dictates of their conscience. Now, Brother Li's conscience tells him to go to the square. ""I feel it is my duty to let the government know it's wrong,"" he says. ""But if I stay out of prison, I might be of more use.""

As he weighs his options, the one thing he doesn't consider is his timing -- but his will turn out to be impeccable. In two days, he will go to Tiananmen, sit cross-legged in the Falun Dafa meditating position and be thrown in jail. It will be early enough in the month so the judges won't yet be handing down the heavy sentences that some will get for protesting directly on the July 22 anniversary. But he will stay in long enough – 15 days -- to witness Beijing's prisons bulge with thousands of anniversary protesters. His wife will go on a hunger strike. He will see a fellow prisoner beaten unconscious. In late July, he will be released.

But now, as he dismounts to catch his breath, all he knows is that it's his turn to test his faith. It is late afternoon and cicadas drown out everything but Brother Li's voice. ""You know my decision,"" he says. ""I'll call you when I get out."""
66,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"Her six-year-old son in tow, Zhang Xueling trudges through the heavy heat of an early summer morning toward the Chinese government's Petitions and Appeals Office. Memory, as much as the heat, weighs on her.

Four months earlier, her mother, Chen Zixiu, ""wanted to come here and protest that Falun Dafa was good,"" Ms. Zhang says. ""But she died trying, so now I'm here on her behalf.""

Ms. Chen had hoped to convince the government that it had unjustly banned Falun Dafa, a spiritual movement that the 58-year-old had joined a few years ago. The trip ended in her arrest, torture and death, documented in an April article in this newspaper. In May, the United Nations Committee Against Torture took up the matter and later criticized China for failing to rein in police abuses. Then, in September, the U.S. State Department cited Ms. Chen's death as a prime example of China's human-rights abuses. Officials at all levels of the Chinese government have refused to comment on Ms. Chen's death.

But on this hot June morning, all that Ms. Chen's 32-year-old daughter wants is her mother's death certificate.

In China, when someone dies, police normally issue a death certificate to the family, upon request. The police officers who witnesses say killed Ms. Zhang's mother on Feb. 21 insist that she died of a heart attack in a hospital. Ms. Zhang hopes that by issuing the death certificate, police will be forced to admit that her mother died in their custody. That, in theory, should trigger an internal investigation and, she hopes, bring her mother's killers to justice.

But Ms. Zhang is beginning to learn how hard it is not only to obtain justice, but merely to seek it, in a country where the most powerful organization, the Communist Party, is above the law. Ms. Zhang hurries toward the Petition and Appeals Office, passing groups of people who, like her, are availing themselves of their right to petition for redress of wrongs at the hands of government. It's a tradition that goes back centuries, and that the party has maintained as a social safety valve. One bedraggled peasant crouches over a sheaf of paper, moving his pen in the air, trying to remember how to write the word ""expropriate."" His clan has been trying for 14 years to recover land that they say was taken illegally by officials.

The building's entrance is in an alley and watched carefully by a dozen plainclothes police with shifty stares and mobile phones. Security agents at the entrance to the alley ask approaching petitioners if they are Falun Dafa adherents. They turn back those who say they are. Ms. Zhang, though, can truthfully say that she isn't an adherent and that her problem is a simple case of police abuse. She is let in.

Two hours later she comes out, shaking her head. ""They said it's a criminal case and should be handled by the Public Security Bureau,"" she says, walking along a garbage-filled canal. ""That's my next stop,"" she adds, and then disappears into a subway station.

A short, stout woman with a round face, bobbed hair and direct eyes, Ms.Zhang was once the sort of person who floated easily through reform-era China. She worked as a clerk at a department store in Weifang, her prosperous hometown of 1.3 million people in eastern China's Shandong province, and took accounting classes in her spare time. She married, had a son and went back to work as a bookkeeper. Later, after neighbors praised her skill in arranging a few marriages, she took advantage of the growing freedom in China to work as a matchmaker -- a profession that the Communist Party forbade during the first 30 years of its rule but that has reappeared over the past two decades of reform.

Then, three years ago, her mother, a retired factory worker, joined Falun Dafa, a fast-growing spiritual movement that derives loosely from Taosim and Buddhism and promises salvation and supernatural powers to its followers. For more than an hour each morning, Ms. Chen practiced the group's regimen of slow-motion calisthenics -- called Falun Gong – which are designed, in accordance with traditional Chinese medicine, to channel energy through the body.

Ms. Zhang was initially supportive of her mother. But she sided with the government when, perceiving a political threat in Falun Dafa, Beijing in July of last year banned the movement. She reiterated to her mother the government's reasoning: Founder Li Hongzhi, who now lives in exile in the U.S., was untrustworthy because, the government said, he had changed his birthdate to match that of the Buddha. She also worried about government reports that 1,500 adherents had died because they had rejected modern medicine in favor of exercise.

But as the crackdown became more brutal late last year, with police detaining thousands of adherents, Ms. Zhang began for the first time in her life to question the government. Beijing claimed that Mr. Li enriched himself on the backs of his followers, but the Falun Dafa adherents Ms. Zhang knew had spent no more than a few dollars on books or instructional videos. Far from being suicidal or superstitious fanatics, her mother's Falun Dafa circle was made up of well-balanced people who didn't reject modern medicine.

She kept these doubts to herself -- until Feb. 21. A few months earlier,in December, Ms. Chen had traveled to Beijing to protest against its ban on the group. She was arrested and sent home. When she tried to go to Beijing again in February, police imprisoned her without charge. Officials demanded that she recant her faith. She refused, was beaten unconscious and, on Feb.21, died, according to prison inmates and family members.

Local officials told Ms. Zhang that her mother had died of a heart attack. The day after Ms. Chen's death, Ms. Zhang and her brother were allowed to see the body, bruised and battered and laid out in traditional mourning garb in a local hospital. The hospital issued a report that day saying Ms. Chen died of natural causes. The hospital won't comment further.

 

Ms. Zhang and her brother couldn't find a lawyer who would take their case. Then, on March 17, Ms. Zhang received a letter from the hospital saying the body, held in refrigeration as the threat of litigation loomed, would be cremated that day. Ms. Zhang never saw her mother's body again.

 

Ms. Zhang couldn't let her mother's death go at that. ""I felt that something wasn't right, and that they were hiding something,"" she says.

She sent letters to the State Council, the highest body of civilian power in China, and to local media, asking for copies of her mother's death certificate. Both groups ignored her. The police didn't; Ms. Zhang calculates that by late April, when she was finally sentenced to 15 days in prison for ""distorting facts and disturbing social order,"" she had been interrogated by police for 107 hours in numerous sessions over several weeks.

The detention was a turning point. ""I was thrown in with common criminals and could finally see the injustice that my mother had suffered,"" Ms. Zhang says. ""I decided to learn everything I could and challenge the authorities using their own language.""

Upon her release, she stopped working as a matchmaker to devote herself full time to pressing her mother's case. She bought handbooks on the law and learned how to make official requests for documents and how to appeal refusals. Her husband, a carpenter, supported her throughout.

The work brought Ms. Zhang into close contact with Falun Dafa adherents,whose underground network came in handy when she took her appeal up through the hierarchy of the bureaucracy. Disciples view Ms. Zhang's mother as a martyr -- one of more than 50 people the organization says have died in the past year in the government crackdown -- and local adherents were happy to put up Ms. Zhang in their homes. They also told her where to find the appeals offices, which the government keeps unmarked and unlisted in the phone directory.

""Only they could really understand the frustrations I had and the hurdles I had to face everyday,"" she says.

Her efforts centered on the death certificate. Officials said the cremation took place on March 17. Immediately afterward, she had applied for a death certificate from police and from the crematorium, but had been rebuffed.She now decided to go through more formal channels, filing written requests for the certificate.

She spent most of May shuttling between offices of the Public Security Bureau in her hometown. Officials at the district office told her that they couldn't release the death certificate and that she should appeal to the higher-level bureau that controls the municipality. That bureau referred her back to the district office, arguing that the lower-level office had to furnish a copy of records before the higher-level office could act. Back at the district office, Ms. Zhang was told the higher-level office didn't need the records because senior officials had been present when the corpse was inspected and were already familiar with the situation. (Officials at all levels refused to be interviewed for this article.)

Frustrated, Ms. Zhang decided in early June to bypass the squabbling officials in Weifang by appealing to officials in the provincial capital, Jinan. Her goal now was to push the provincial procurator's office, which acts like a prosecutor's office in the U.S., to file criminal charges against the Public Security Bureau for failing to release the death certificate.

But the procurator's office, which works closely with security forces, told her to file a civil lawsuit. When she approached lawyers, however, they told her the Ministry of Justice had issued a directive to all lawyers advising them not to accept cases related to Falun Dafa. Stymied again, she headed for Beijing and the Petitions and Appeals Office.

So on that hot June day, Ms. Zhang emerges from the subway and heads to the Public Security Bureau, as the Petitions and Appeals Office had advised.It's the morning of June 19, and she arrives to find that visiting hours are already over. The adrenaline that has kept her going the past few days slowly ebbs. Her son scampers away, hoping his mother will follow.

Ms. Zhang takes a deep breath and determines to visit one more place before giving up. Beijing is dotted with several lesser petitions offices that belong to various minor ministries. Maybe just one of them, she figures, can help. Nearby is the petition office of the All-China Women's Federation, a government-run organization that is supposed to look after the interests of China's 650 million women. She doubts that it has much power, but grabs her son by the hand and heads over.

After losing her way in the maze of alleys that make up Beijing's old city, she finally finds the unmarked office. A woman looks up from behind her desk and asks Ms. Zhang to explain her case. The woman listens carefully to Ms. Zhang, nodding her head and sighing. Then she pushes her glasses up on the bridge of her nose and speaks carefully: ""Rule of law is still rudimentary right now. This case will be hard to solve, but you have to go back to the Public Security Bureau.""

The answer is blunt, but it is the first civil reply Ms. Zhang has received from the dozens of bureaucrats she has approached. Her courage builds. She gathers her son and heads out into the heat, vowing to return to the Public Security Bureau in the afternoon.

At 2 p.m. she walks up once again to the unmarked door. Her son, who cries at the sight of uniformed police, has fallen asleep. Ms. Zhang carries him slung over her shoulder as she enters.

An hour later, she emerges, her face beaming. She carries a letter sealed by the Public Security Bureau that she suspects contains orders for the local security bureaus to give her the death certificate. She shakes her head in amazement. ""I don't know,"" she says, letting her son down gently to the ground as he wakes up. ""Maybe I can finally get an answer.""

Back in Weifang two days later, she is at the local office of the Public Security Bureau. When an official there opens the letter, she glimpses the brief order: ""Handle this case in writing"" -- in other words, give a written response. Ms. Zhang is ecstatic.

But then, days pass without reply. She returns again and again to the local bureau until finally someone in the office tells her that police won't issue the death certificate. She isn't sure if this is because the body actually wasn't ever cremated -- the crematorium might have feared being charged with destroying evidence -- or simply because the police are ignoring the written orders from Beijing. In any case, her joy gives way to resignation as she begins to realize that she probably never will lay eyes on her mother's death certificate.

The experience has changed her: Where she once agreed with the government that the maintenance of order is paramount, she now supports civil disobedience for a just cause. She begins to write down her thoughts. The process of petitioning ""enabled me to meet people being treated unfairly and to listen to the ridiculous things that happened to them,"" Ms. Zhang writes in an unpublished essay. ""Apart from Falun Gong practitioners, who are taken away by the public security, less than 10% of those [other] petitioners expect to have their problem settled. Most petitioners only get a chance to exchange their complaints with each other and end up with empty pockets.''

By late August, she still hasn't received a response from the local security bureau. She heads back to Beijing, hoping at least to have her 15-day detention expunged from her records. She remembers that while in jail, the only people who were decent to her were Falun Dafa prisoners. In recent weeks, she has started to learn about the group's teachings and to practice Falun Gong herself.

""I used to be a materialist and believed that everything in life could be gained from hard work,"" she says, heading back from a fruitless trip to the Supreme Court to the house of a fellow believer. ""But Falun Dafa makes more sense. At its root are three principles: truthfulness, compassion and tolerance. If we adhere to these, isn't that a deeper meaning to life?""

Ms. Zhang has exhausted all legal channels, and figures that even clearing her record will be impossible. Increasingly, she takes solace in her beliefs, and turns her attention to her son, a reminder of the grandmother who was so fond of him.

He starts school in September, and Ms. Zhang worries about the government textbooks that he will start reading, with their heavy emphasis on patriotism and nationalism. She has decided to start teaching him the principles of Falun Dafa. ""I teach him that when someone hits him, it's the person who hit him who is wrong,"" she says. ""His grandmother had this belief. I have it now, and so will he.''"
67,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"Two Falun Dafa members have filed suit with China's supreme court, alleging several senior Communist Party leaders are personally responsible for the 15-month crackdown against the spiritual group.

The suit highlights a growing belief among Falun Dafa adherents that the government's ban is directly attributable to a handful of Chinese leaders centered on President and Communist Party head Jiang Zemin. Although the suit stands little chance of being heard -- indeed, the men who filed the suit are said to be in jail -- it reflects a growing personalization of the conflict, which pits regular protesters in downtown Beijing against the party's formidable security apparatus.

Since late September, for example, Falun Dafa's main overseas Web site (http://clearwisdom.net/) has started carrying articles blaming Mr. Jiang for the crackdown and chronicling what it described as a well-laid plan to stigmatize and ultimately ban the group. Such articles were widely disseminated in China, helping to galvanize protests last week in Beijing that resulted in more than 1,000 Falun Dafa practitioners being arrested.

The suit was filed in late August, but a copy of it was only obtained within the past few days. Friends of the litigants smuggled a copy out of China after police pursued them for more than a month through several cities, they say. They arrived in Hong Kong and then departed for another country.

The suit specifies that two of Mr. Jiang's top lieutenants, Zeng Qinghong and Luo Gan, pushed for the ban during the spring and summer of 1999 because they had been humiliated by a protest in downtown Beijing that April. More than 10,000 Falun Dafa adherents peacefully surrounded the leadership compound, called Zhongnanhai, demanding an end to what they said was slanted reporting of their organization in the government-controlled media.

Mr. Zeng controls senior leadership appointments and Mr. Luo oversees security. Both are considered rising stars in the leadership and top candidates to succeed Mr. Jiang when he retires, as expected, in two years.

Government officials said they hadn't seen the suit and had no comment.

The 22-page document points to specific meetings that the three leaders attended in which it says they insisted that the crackdown be especially severe -- thousands have been arrested and numerous people killed by police brutality. Although Mr. Jiang is sometimes seen as a moderate among China's leaders, the banned spiritual group says the 74-year-old leader has taken a personal interest in stamping out the group. ""He [Jiang] was very dissatisfied with how the Zhongnanhai incident was handled and felt his legacy was threatened,"" the suit says in its introduction.

The suit was filed by Wang Jie, 37, an editor with the Survey and Mapping Publishing House, and Hong Kong resident Zhu Keming, 43, an artist and businessman. The two are being held on the outskirts of Beijing in the Fangshan Public Security Bureau Detention Center, according to people who have been held in the detention center and have seen them there."
68,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"The United Nations, which has just concluded an agreement designed to improve human rights in China, recently sponsored an international conference that Beijing used to justify its brutal crackdown on the spiritual movement Falun Dafa.

The International Symposium on Cults, held Nov. 9 and 10 in Beijing, was co-sponsored by the China International Friendship Association and the U.N. Development Program, whose representative here, Kerstin Leitner, delivered the opening address. China's state-run media gave the meeting prominent coverage, saying it showed that other countries supported the crackdown on organizations such as Falun Dafa, popularly known as Falun Gong.

China outlawed Falun Dafa last year, saying it advocated exercise over medicine and unhealthy fealty to founder Li Hongzhi, a native Chinese who now lives in the U.S. Most countries and international organizations, including several U.N. bodies, have condemned the crackdown as suppression of religious freedom. Scores of practitioners have died from police mistreatment, thousands have been sent to labor camps and tens of thousands have been detained without charge. Now, a Hong Kong group says, two more Falun Dafa members have died in Chinese custody and an adherent who sued President Jiang Zemin is missing.

On Monday, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, signed an agreement to help Beijing protect individual rights through training of law-enforcement officers, judges and other legal officials. The UNDP's Beijing office, which sponsored the cult conference, will implement the agreement.

Ms. Robinson said it was ""extremely appropriate"" that Ms. Leitner's office sponsored the conference because it would help China understand how other countries deal with organizations similar to Falun Dafa. Ms. Leitner also staunchly defended the conference, which she said was proposed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Beijing a year ago. While she said she objected to its name, which in Chinese translates as a symposium on ""evil cults,"" she said the goal was to open Chinese officials' eyes to softer ways of dealing with cults.

In her speech, Ms. Leitner said China had traditionally been threatened by ""quasireligious movements"" that ""threatened the established order"" at times of social change. Now, however, such groups work internationally and need a coordinated response from the world community, she said. She said China's actions on Falun Dafa are ""an issue of good governance"" -- implying that action was needed, but it could have been handled better."
69,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong," Chen Xingqiao would seem to be a natural ally for the Chinese government as it struggles to crush the spiritual group Falun Dafa.

The 43-year-old Buddhist, who works in a small temple in Beijing's leafy western district, was one of the earliest critics of the group. He argued in 1996 -- three years before Falun Dafa was outlawed -- that it was an illegally registered religious organization and therefore should be banned. But even now, with China desperate for allies in its 18-month battle against Falun Dafa, Mr. Chen's views have never been aired in public. Government censors proscribe local media from running interviews with him; his 1998 book on the group has never been distributed to bookstores.

The reason: Mr. Chen has a more nuanced view of Falun Dafa than the authorities -- one that doesn't jibe with their black-or-white approach. The government has lurched from one extreme to another as it tries to come to terms with the new religion, which is widely known as Falun Gong and advocates a combination of moral precepts and physical exercise. First, it muzzled critics such as Mr. Chen, hoping Falun Dafa would disappear if it wasn't discussed. Then, after Falun Dafa members mistakenly interpreted this as a sign of official support, the government hit the group with a campaign of vitriol and violence. Tens of thousands have been arrested and scores tortured to death.

""I thought Falun Dafa was bad, but that it had to be understood as part of this religious hunger that people have,"" says Mr. Chen, who edits a Buddhist magazine. ""But the bureaucrats can't understand what motivates most people.""

At the root of these problems is a government out of step with an increasingly complex and diverse country. Set up five decades ago to run a totalitarian dictatorship, China's government has learned over the past two decades how to reform its economy -- witness China's pending entry into the World Trade Organization -- and has largely stopped meddling in people's private lives.

But fearful of losing power, leaders have stunted the development of independent organizations -- religions, trade unions, business groups, a free press and charities -- that anchor truly stable societies. Trade groups still must register with government-run chambers of commerce, restricting their ability to speak out on behalf of members. Newspapers, magazines and television stations remain under tight government supervision, and Internet sites have been told that they must bear the consequences of what they publish.

Even micro-credit programs to alleviate rural poverty must be run through government agencies, which have put China decades behind other developing countries in establishing this widely recognized method of helping the poor. As China hurtles forward, driven by ever-faster economic and social change, its rulers still rely on two simplistic ways to deal with social change: neglect or suppression.

 

A close look at the events leading up to the crackdown on Falun Dafa shows how some people worked hard for a more moderate outcome. Many, like Mr. Chen, didn't like Falun Dafa, but they recognized it as part of a bigger problem that needed to be addressed. Others shared the argument of He Zuoxiu, a prominent senior physicist who felt that confrontation and hard-nosed debate would check Falun Dafa's rapid growth by revealing the group's penchant for bullying its critics. Only the government, ossified after decades in power, refused to address the social upheaval that was fueling Falun Dafa's rise, or to ease the rigid policies that were setting the group on a collision course with the Communist Party.

At first, Falun Dafa was untouched by Chinese officialdom because of a loosening of state control under way since the late 1970s. After Mao Tse-tung's death in 1976 ended his last, catastrophic decade in power, the Communist Party tried to win back popular support by reforming the economy. It also permitted a partial rebirth of religion, which the officially atheist party tightly controlled with elaborate rules and regulations. But, weakened by years of internal power struggles, the party was forced to turn a blind eye to a wide swath of gray-area activities, including folk religions.

One was Falun Dafa. Like similar movements through the centuries, Falun Dafa was headed by a man claiming superhuman powers and demanding a return to traditional morals -- ""popular fundamentalism,"" as some scholars call it. It also drew on qigong, an exercise technique that involves controlled breathing, meditation and slow-motion calisthenics. And like many of the new spiritual movements flooding the country at this time, it originated in China's far north, a rust belt of shuttered factories and long unemployment lines.

Mr. Chen first came across Falun Dafa in 1994, when he still lived in Harbin, a northern city only a day's drive from the Russian border. A friend took him to hear Falun Dafa's founder, Li Hongzhi, speak. Mr. Chen, a committed Buddhist, didn't like what he heard. Part of the speech, he says, denigrated Buddhism, while the rest was laced with claims of prescience. ""I figured he was one of those typical northeastern Chinese supermen and forgot about him,"" says Mr. Chen, a wiry man with a quick wit and a broad smile.

But during the next two years, Mr. Chen found it increasingly hard to ignore Falun Dafa. Thanks to fervent proselytizing, the group became the most popular of the new religions that were offering a moral compass in a turbulent age. Almost every park in Harbin featured a Falun Dafa exercise spot. Corner bookstands were lined with the group's books and videotapes. Many Buddhists were even returning their statues and sutras, or scriptures, to temples, saying they weren't as powerful as Mr. Li's main text, ""Turning the Dharma Wheel.""

Even in the tool factory where Mr. Chen worked as an administrator before taking his editing job, Falun Dafa slowly became unavoidable. Believers practiced for an hour every morning in the front yard of the plant and met for discussion groups in the evening. Curious, Mr. Chen picked up a copy of Mr. Li's book and spent several months studying it. His conclusion: Falun Dafa was a heretical offshoot of Buddhism that misappropriated traditional religious terms such as ""Dharma Wheel"" to give it legitimacy. He wrote a 20,000-word essay called ""Revealing the Original Face of Falun Gong -- a New Kind of Folk Religion"" and gave it to his local Buddhist association.

But Mr. Chen's analysis was too penetrating and his remedy too radical for China's rigid officialdom. The country's religious bureaucracy recognizes only five religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Islam, Protestantism and Taoism. To check their growth, the government bans proselytizing outside places of worship. But Mr. Chen noted that organizations such as Falun Dafa, which had officially registered with the government as an exercise group, labored under no such restrictions.

Mr. Chen's solution: unshackle established religions so they could compete on equal terms. If Falun Dafa could hold meetings in sports stadiums and recruit passersby in the park, why not allow Buddhists to do the same? The response from officials, though, was predictable: They ignored his proposals. ""They were just interested in keeping everything quiet,"" Mr. Chen says.

Open discussion of Falun Dafa would also expose the central paradox in official policy. Acknowledging Falun Dafa as a religion would mean officials would either have to allow a new religion to register, or ban it. Registering a new religion is impossible in China -- it hasn't happened in five decades of Communist rule -- while banning it would be an admission that the government had allowed a religion to flourish for years in the guise of an exercise group.

Mr. Chen's frustrations came to a head later in 1996, when the Harbin city government convened a meeting called ""Socialism and Buddhism."" As a senior lay member of the city's Buddhist community, Mr. Chen attended and brought up Falun Dafa for discussion.

The issue died after just a few minutes' debate. Representatives from the police said they could act only when a disturbance occurred, while officials from the religious bureau said they are allowed to oversee activities only inside established places of worship, according to people present at the meeting. ""It fell through the cracks, so the government simply ignored it and hoped it would go away,"" says an official at the Harbin public-security office who attended the 1996 meeting. Adds Mr. Chen: ""It was a new religion, but no one knew what to do about it because new religions are illegal. Therefore it didn't exist.""

Mr. Chen decided that if the bureaucracy wouldn't act, he would prod it by publishing his essay, which the local Buddhist association had forwarded to its national headquarters. He turned to its head, Zhao Puchu, a rare figure who managed to remain respected in religious circles while maintaining the trust of party officials.

Mr. Zhao liked the essay and sent it to China's leading party newspaper, People's Daily. The paper initially wanted to publish a condensed version in its elite ""Internal Reference"" edition, which is read by the country's top leaders. But after asking Mr. Chen for permission to run such a version, a senior editor killed it.

""Several things prevented us from running it,"" says an editor at the newspaper. ""Foremost was that he talked too frankly about religion. We just can't do that.""

Mr. Zhao then ordered that the tract be published in early 1997 in ""Religious Trends,"" an internal publication of the Buddhist association. After a further year of effort, he got the essay printed by a publishing house run by the party's religious-affairs office.

These were victories, but small ones. Reflecting government suspicion of religion, ""Religious Trends"" was allowed to be distributed only to members of the Buddhist association, so its impact was negligible. The book was deemed too sensitive to distribute to bookstores. Instead, interested readers had to contact the publishing house in Beijing and pick it up in person.

One person who did take note of Mr. Chen's book was He Zuoxiu. A rumpled, energetic 73-year-old, Mr. He is one of China's most famous physicists and for years has made it his personal crusade to popularize science and combat what he sees as his countrymen's predilection for superstition. He had come across Falun Dafa in 1996 but dismissed its scriptures as humbug.

Two years later, however, Mr. He realized he had been mistaken to write it off so lightly. By then, Falun Dafa had exploded in popularity, spreading from the far north to China's big cities. It had in effect become China's unofficial sixth religion, boasting tens of millions of adherents -- some estimates ran as high as 100 million in this nation of more than 1.3 billion.

One believer was a student in Mr. He's research institute, who in the spring of 1998 was committed to a mental institution for obsessively practicing Falun Dafa. The young man refused to eat or drink and would only meditate. Mr. He heard from a friend about Mr. Chen's book, read it and decided Falun Dafa was a cult.

Unlike Mr. Chen, who saw in Falun Dafa's rise proof that the country needed more religious freedom, Mr. He believed it was another quasi-religious group that needed to be put in its place. An old-school Marxist, Mr. He believes in science, not religion, and today remains one of a small number of members still active in the China Atheists Association. So in May, when Beijing Television came to film a report on Mr. He's institute, he grabbed the opportunity to criticize Falun Dafa, attacking it as ""responsible for sending a young man to the hospital.""

The day after the show aired on May 11, 1998, Mr. He realized he was in for a fight. That morning, half a dozen adherents showed up at his house and sat in his living room for three hours, arguing with him. ""I showed them that I'd read their book and all the parts that I thought were nonsense,"" he said. ""It was a bit unpleasant having all these people coming to your home, but in the end we just agreed that we didn't agree and they left.""

Mr. He promptly called the station and found out that a few Falun Dafa adherents were outside the station with pickets. Fresh from his experience with the argumentative students, Mr. He urged Beijing Television not to buckle. ""The idea that they could protest outside a major organization of the party was unimaginable,"" he says

But, as Mr. Chen had learned two years earlier, Mr. He soon discovered that officials were bent on the path of least resistance. By early June, the number of protesters outside Beijing TV had grown to 2,000 – all peaceful and orderly but shocking to authorities in Beijing, which hadn't seen a significant demonstration since the student protests in Tiananmen Square a decade earlier. With the ninth anniversary of those demonstrations rapidly approaching -- still a sensitive time on China's political calendar -- leaders ordered the television station to end the Falun Dafa protest at any cost.

The station quickly complied. To show goodwill, it handed out 2,000 boxed lunches and promised to air a sympathetic portrayal of the group. The next day, the show ran as promised, the protests dispersed and quiet returned to the Chinese capital.

Mr. He was incensed at the acquiescence. He did more research and found out that the party had regularly yielded to Falun Dafa protesters. Several media outlets -- estimates range as high as 14 -- had been besieged by Falun Dafa adherents angry at reports casting doubt on its claim to foster good health through exercise. In almost every case, the media had backed down, printing or airing apologies to Falun Dafa.

Most, Mr. He learned, were simply taking their cue from the China Press and Publication Administration, which controls content in China's media. The office had a ""three nots"" policy on groups such as Falun Dafa: media should not be for it, should not be against it and should not label it good or bad -- part of the agency's general policy of avoiding anything controversial. Newspapers had been following this rule since 1996 when Enlightenment Daily, the main newspaper aimed at cultural circles, published a book review critical of Mr. Li's work and became the first media organization to be besieged by angry adherents who demanded -- and received -- a retraction.

To the stability-minded mandarins who run the country, this seemed like sound policy, one that the Beijing Television protests bore out. Opening up a messy debate about Falun Dafa would have sparked more protests and allowed people such as Mr. Chen to call for religious freedom. Few considered the lesson that Falun Dafa was learning: that demonstrations were acceptable.

Mr. He decided to force the party to change its policy -- and unlike Mr. Chen, he had more ways to make society take notice of Falun Dafa. As a famous academic researcher and government loyalist, he was a member of a top-level consultative committee that advises the Communist Party on policy. Although largely powerless, the committee provided Mr. He with some cover to step up his criticism of Falun Dafa.

He started by sending a letter to President Jiang Zemin, warning him that a new religion with tens of millions of followers was spreading across China. The letter, which he titled ""Reckless Falun Gong ,"" was written by Mr. He and five fellow members of the committee. There was no reply.

Refusing to be discouraged, Mr. He began writing articles for any publication that would accept his work. Most followed the party's three-nots campaign, but a few regional journals, unaware of the central government's policy, were happy to run articles by the famous scientist. ""The bigger papers . . . were afraid they'd have to apologize,"" Mr. He says. ""So I had to publish in these small newspapers and magazines.""

While Mr. He plugged away, Falun Dafa enjoyed a banner year in 1998. Though its founder, Mr. Li, had emigrated to the U.S., he returned often to coordinate activities and stayed in close contact with practitioners through a tightly knit organization. Critics such as Mr. He continued their pinprick attacks, but the party's do-nothing policies coupled with Falun Dafa's militancy had marginalized them.

""The government was mostly supportive of us,"" says Zhang Erping, a Falun Dafa spokesman who lives in New York. ""Many top leaders seemed to support us.""

This impression was understandable but wrong. Most of China's leaders didn't accept or agree with Falun Dafa; their crude governing apparatus had simply kept them in the dark. That was about to change, not because leaders had become wiser, but because Falun Dafa was to make a tactical mistake.

As 1998 wound down, Mr. He decided to write a short commentary for a small student magazine called Science and Technology Knowledge for Youth. The article, ""Why Young People Shouldn't Practice Qigong,"" was one of his typical blasts at all forms of qigong, which he said was more suitable to older, less-active people. Halfway through the article, he mentioned Falun Dafa and then, in a key phrase that angered the group, referred to Mr. Li in a mildly derisive term as its toutou, or ""boss.""

The response came quickly. The day after the magazine was printed, protesters arrived at its offices on the campus of Tianjin Normal University, located about 100 miles east of Beijing. From April 20 to 23, as many as 6,000 occupied the university, demanding a retraction. ""The publishers called me,"" Mr. He says, reaching over to touch his green plastic rotary phone. ""And asked me what was going on. I told them that as a science publication, they had better not print a retraction.""

The magazine stood firm. Angry Falun Dafa members then made their fateful decision to seek help from the very top echelons of the party. It was a turn of events that even Mr. He couldn't have foreseen. He had hoped his magazine articles would attract the leaders' attention; instead, his articles had provoked Falun Dafa into doing this for him. On April 25, 1999, an estimated 10,000 members peacefully surrounded the central government's leadership compound in downtown Beijing and asked that Falun Dafa be legitimized as a normal part of society.

It was a colossal miscalculation -- and a shock to the leadership. Frantic officials called Mr. He, demanding material on Falun Dafa. He couriered over a packet of stuff, including Mr. Chen's book.

Shortly after the demonstration, President Jiang Zemin issued an open letter to all senior leaders, calling Falun Dafa a threat to the party's authority. In the letter -- which was also read in party cell meetings, so everyone got the message -- Mr. Jiang chastized the government's security apparatus for allowing the protest to take place. ""We called for 'stability above all,' but our stability has fallen through,"" Mr. Jiang wrote. ""Our leaders must wake up.""

Soon, the creaky government bureaucracy that had ignored and unwittingly encouraged Falun Dafa for years finally started to formulate a response to the group. But there was to be no public discussion on religious freedom, as Mr. Chen wanted, nor the sort of robust, no-gloves debate favored by Mr. He.

Instead, the party took the only action it knew. It set up a bureau called Office 610 -- named for the date, June 10, when it was formed – whose job was to mobilize the country's pliant social organizations. Under orders from the Public Security Bureau, churches, temples, mosques, newspapers, media, courts and police all quickly lined up behind the government's simple plan: to crush Falun Dafa. Within days, the first arrests were made.

As a staunch communist, Mr. He loyally backed the government's actions and so was interviewed widely in the government press. But he often referred people to Mr. Chen, the first person to recognize Falun Dafa as worthy of serious attention and study. Finally, Mr. Chen thought, he would have a chance to air his views.

Newspapers and television stations dutifully showed up at Mr. Chen's temple in Beijing. Each time, Mr. Chen would make his case and wait for something to appear in print or on air. Each time, nothing appeared.

""I criticized Falun Gong, but I also talked about the need for religion. Yet all the government wanted to do was fight it,"" says Mr. Chen, staring hard at the cover of his book. ""Religion is a good resource. People need it. But the party is still completely ignorant of it."""
70,WSJ,Ian Johnson,2001,China Falun Gong,"Rising out of the North China Plain in a jumble of dusty apartment blocks and crowded roads, this is an unremarkable Chinese city in every respect but one: Local police regularly torture residents to death.

Since the beginning of the year, when police killed a 58-year-old retiree, at least 10 more Weifang residents have died in police custody, according to relatives and a human-rights monitoring group. All were practitioners of the spiritual group Falun Dafa, which the central government banned last year. Across this country of 1.3 billion, at least 77 Falun Dafa adherents have now died in detention, according to reports by human-rights groups. Weifang, which has less than 1% of the national population, accounts for 15% of those deaths.

Why?

The answer has its roots in imperial China, when the country developed a system of social control that is still used today. It puts huge pressure on local officials to comply with central edicts -- but gives them absolute discretion over implementation. For officials running Weifang, that meant they were under strict orders to eliminate the huge number of Falun Dafa protesters in their district but faced no scrutiny of the methods they used.

That led to a series of bizarre and ultimately tragic decisions. Under intense pressure to stem the flow of protesters heading to Beijing, Weifang officials stationed police in Beijing, ran their own prison there and sent detainees to ""transformation centers"" back home where they were beaten until they renounced their faith, or died. The ferocity of police in these centers only increased after higher-level officials started fining their subordinates for each protester who arrived in the capital, according to city officials and former detainees.

Besides explaining the mechanics of death, this city's tale also points to the direction this conflict is likely to take in the future. With the two-year anniversary of Beijing's still-unsuccessful crackdown on Falun Dafa approaching in the spring -- a duration that far exceeds any other challenge during the Communists' five decades in power -- efforts to crush the group have become a grinding battle between a stubborn government and a hard core of believers. Like the Tiananmen protests of 1989, it has left countless scars below the surface of society, and has become another marker on China's painful path to modernization.

Weifang hardly seems like the sort of place that would become the focal point of tragedy. Indeed, if one were trying to find an Anytown in China, Weifang might be it. It has a famous past as a commercial center and is the hometown of flowing, silk-covered Chinese kites. Today, it is a small industrial center in one of China's wealthiest provinces and boasts a per-capita income slightly above the national average.

Like most Chinese cities, Weifang feels more rural than its population would indicate. Officially, the greater metropolitan area has eight million residents, but this includes a huge swath of densely populated countryside. The urban center has just 620,000 people, and its streets are filled with farmers driving their tractors to markets. Like most parts of China, foreigners are still so rare that people stop and stare when one walks past.

Falun Dafa, which is also known as Falun Gong, caught on early here and across Shandong province, a densely populate coastal region that has developed rapidly in the past decade. Some say the group's Shandong organizers were especially gifted; others note that its founder paid a successful visit to the province several years ago. Falun Dafa, which teaches slow-motion calisthenics and moral precepts drawn from Taoism and Buddhism, certainly fit in with the region's spiritual tradition: Confucius' birthplace, Qufu, and one of China's holiest Taoist pilgrimage sites, Mt. Tai, are located nearby.

By 1999, Weifang had one of heaviest concentrations of believers in the province, with an estimated 60,000 adherents, according to an unpublished government report. The town's parks and squares had regular meeting points for members, who typically practice their exercises every morning. That ended when about 10,000 Falun Dafa practitioners protested in downtown Beijing in April, 1999, asking the government that their group be legalized. The central government responded by banning Falun Dafa in July; Weifang authorities followed suit, rounding up local Falun Dafa organizers and closing down the public exercise spots.

Initially, Weifang was quiet, adherents and government officials say. In November of last year, however, Beijing staged show trials of several prominent Falun Dafa organizers, spurring what has become a steady stream of protests in the capital. It was at that time that the woman who would become Weifang's first victim, Chen Zixiu, traveled to Beijing. After being arrested, sent back to Weifang and then released, she was detained again earlier this year and beaten to death, according to eyewitnesses. Her case was reported in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year.

The officials' brutality toward Ms. Chen seemed exceptional at the time. Torture in China is common, but even Ms. Chen's family thought that her death was an aberration, the result of an especially cruel jailer. Since then, however, Falun Dafa practitioners have died regularly in Weifang's prisons, about one a month, casting doubt on the idea that one person is responsible. Instead, it appears that the violence is systemic, stemming from policies adopted in Beijing and implemented locally.

Officials in Beijing set up the framework for the killings one year ago after they became impatient with the continued flow of protesters from around China into the capital. Deciding drastic measures were needed, they reached for a tried-and-true method of enforcing central edicts, one honed over centuries of imperial rule.

Based on the 2,200-year-old bao jia method of controlling society, the system pushes responsibility for following central orders onto neighborhoods, with the local boss responsible for the actions of everyone in his territory. In ancient times, that meant the headman of a family or clan was personally responsible for paying taxes, raising troops and apprehending criminals.

A variant of this is now in use to implement even broader policy goals. After the Communist Party launched economic reforms in the late 1970s, it had great success by signing ""contracts"" with peasants and factory chiefs, who had to deliver a certain amount of grain or industrial output but were given complete latitude over the methods used. By the late 1980s, provincial governors were also signing similar contracts, being held personally responsible for maintaining grain output in their province or holding down births to a certain level.

Now the problem was Falun Dafa. The government's Office 610, a bureau that was coordinating the crackdown, issued an order in December 1999, telling officials of local governments they would be held personally responsible if they didn't stem the flow of protesters to Beijing, according to Weifang officials. As in years past, no questions would be asked about how this was achieved -- success was all that mattered.

Weifang officials knew the policy meant trouble for them. China has other concentrations of Falun Dafa believers, such as in the country's northeast where the group was founded. But those are remote from the capital. Weifang is located just 300 miles southeast of Beijing, making it easy for protesters to travel to the capital even after the city took an initial precaution of sending security agents to train and bus stations. ""After a while the police were waiting for us at the train station, so we started to bike and walk to Beijing,"" confirms a 48-year-old practitioner. ""It takes four days to bike to Beijing, 12 days to walk. I did it both ways.""

 

As the flow of protesters continued into the new year, central authorities didn't have far to look to find a scapegoat. The man held responsible was Wu Guangzheng, the 62-year-old governor of Shandong province. Mr. Wu is a member of the Communist Party's 21-member Politburo, making him one of the most powerful men in China. But Mr. Wu was in a precarious position. Most Politburo members are central-government officials. Only two governors sit on the Politburo: Mr. Wu and the governor of Guangdong province, which doesn't have many protesters. That meant Mr. Wu was a focal point of Politburo meetings called to discuss the protests. ""The central government told Governor Wu that he was personally responsible. He risked losing his job if he didn't do something,"" said a Weifang official, now retired. ""Everyone knew the pressure he was under.""

Mr. Wu quickly found ways to transfer the pressure. First, Weifang city officials say, Mr. Wu ensured that every official in the city knew what was at stake, by calling a meeting of police and government officials to a ""study session."" There, the central government's directive was read out loud. ""The government instructed us to limit the number of protesters or be responsible says another government official.

Such methods quickly led to abuses. Several Falun Dafa adherents imprisoned by local police early this year say their captors told them that their continued protests threatened to derail officials' careers. ""One policeman beat me with truncheons,"" says a 43-year-old factory worker imprisoned December 1999. ""He said we were responsible for his boss's political problems.""

That detainee was beaten after being arrested in Beijing and transferred back to his hometown of Weifang. City officials said such arrerests reflected badly on Governor Wu and the rest of the province because people arrested in Beijing are booked by central security agents and their hometown noted. Statistics are then compiled, and provinces with a high number of protesters-- like Shandong -- are criticized. Beating people in Weifang might eventually slow down the number of protesters, but authorities wanted results immediately.

So, earlier this year, local officials devised a plan to skirt Beijing's monitoring of their performance. Like many other cities, Weifang maintains a permanent representative bureau in the capital that functions as a lobbying office and a hostel for bureaucrats visiting the capital on busine. The city doubled the office's staff to 40 and stationed about a dozen police officers in Beijing. Their cars, identifiable by their license plates often park on the side streets around Tiananmen Square when protests take place.

According to an employee in the office and Falun Dafa adherents were arrested. Weifang residents detained in Beijing were then handed directly to Weifang police, who drove the practitioners to the representative office, which now functioned as a prison. The staff there watched over them until they were transferred back to Weifang. The arrangement suited Beijing police, who were able to shift some of their work burden. And it helped Weifang's image, because detainees who wouldn't be booked in Beijing prisons show up on the central government's tally of laggard provinces.

Few detainees say they were beaten in the Beijing representative office. Instead, they were sent directly to one of seven locally run transformation centers"" -- which earlier on were called ""education and study centers"" --set up in Weifang. It was at these unofficial prisons that the killings occurred.

Use of these ""centers"" coincided with another policy change that added what probably was the final ingredient needed for the killings to take place: a ferocity brought on by fear of financial ruin.

Instead of just threatening to ruin local officials' careers, Mr. Wu's colleagues in the provincial government started to fine them as well. The twist was simple: The provincial government fined mayors and heads of counties for each Falun Dafa practitioner from their district who went to Beijing. The mayors and county heads in turn fined the heads of their Political and Legal Commissions, holding them responsible. They in turn fined village chiefs, who in turn fined the police officers -- who administered the punishment. The fines varied from district to district, but in one Weifang district the head of the Political and Legal Commission was fined 200 yuan per person protesting in Tiananmen Square, or about $25-- a potentially ruinous amount given that his monthly salary is only about $200, according to one of the official's colleagues.

The fines were illegal; no law or regulation has ever been issued in writing that lists them. Officials say the policy was announced orally at government meetings. ""There was never to be anything in writing because they didn't want it made public,"" says a member of the city's Political and Legal Commission.

Thus a chief feature in torture victims' testimony is that they were constantly being asked for money to compensate for the fines. For example, the family of Weifang's first victim, Ms. Chen, was told to pay a $241 fine in exchange for her release. When the family balked, Ms. Chen was held another night and then beaten to death.

Relatives and fellow prisoners of other victims tell similar stories. For example, the most recent prisoner to die in Weifang, Xuan Chengxi, was killed in October after officials asked him repeatedly for money, according to two people who tended to his wounds before he died. All the members of his family, however, were Falun Dafa practitioners and had lost their jobs, leaving them unable to pay. Police responded by beating him with rubber truncheons and dousing him in cold water for several hours before he fell into a coma and died, the witnesses say.

Weifang city officials -- many of whom now privately worry that the crackdown has been a terrible mistake -- say none of the police directly involved in the deaths have been reprimanded. In fact, the three officers who oversaw Ms. Chen's interrogation have since been promoted, they say, true to the tradition of giving local authorities a free hand, no questions asked.

The cumulative effect is that 11 Falun Dafa practitioners have died from abuses they suffered in Weifang prisons this year, according to family members and eyewitnesses interviewed for this article. An independent human-rights monitoring group in Hong Kong, the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, has verified one more death, for a total of 12. According to the center, the rest of Shandong accounts for another 12 victims, for a total of 24. The next-highest number of deaths is 14 for Heilongjiang province.

Nationally, the latitude given by the central government was likely responsible for other deaths as well. Falun Dafa claims a total of 91 practitioners have died from police brutality; Amnesty International, the London-based human-rights group, says the total is 77.

Besides resulting in deaths, the policy has driven people underground, ruined careers and split families. Two Falun Dafa adherents who worked in the city government, for example, have been forced to leave their homes. Like dozens of other adherents, they live with relatives out of fear of arrest.

Their daughter, also a Falun Dafa practitioner, was kicked out of university for refusing to renounce her faith and now floats from family to family. ""This won't go on much longer, will it?"" she asks a visitor. ""The government has to relent and legalize us. That's all we're asking.""

The effects on society of such systematic brutality is hard to gauge. None of the deaths have been reported in the Chinese media. Only those directly touched by the crackdown know of its scope and ferocity. In a country of 1.3 billion, most are ignorant and many accept the state-run media's explanation that Falun Dafa is a dangerous cult, a mind-controlling organization that must be crushed at all costs to preserve stability.

But in a small city like Weifang, word of the deaths has spread quietly. In the city's impressive kite museum, a curator's eyes widen when he is asked about the killings. ""No one can talk about these things,"" he says, unpacking boxes of the city's trademark wood-framed kites wrapped in brightly colored silk. ""But a lot of people know."""
71,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"Three of Muhammad Uddin's sons froze to death along the narrow rim of the Sabzak Pass, where the elevation was steep and the truck tires could not hold. The snowfall was thick, the winds piercing. To one side was a yawning plunge. The eight families that had crowded into the vehicle's open flatbed thought it better to climb out and sleep on the wet ground than chance a mortal slide over the edge.

They were fleeing hunger, and their journey had begun with a three- day walk to the road through the mountains, carrying what they could, many of them burdened with exhausted children rather than extra clothing and blankets. Mr. Uddin's boys were 8, 6 and 3. In the morning's unfolding light, he saw that their faces had turned a bluish color and their jaws had gone slack. He poked at them. He poked again. And then he understood.

""The cold took their lives,"" he said listlessly, soon after reaching Herat, drawn here by a lodestone of food no more bountiful than a monthly ration of wheat flour.

Since fall, Afghan villagers have been making their way to this city by the hundreds, until the hundreds are now 80,000, and the 80,000 may well double as the snows melt in the distant peaks and gullies. They have buried their dead, mortgaged their land and sold the last of their possessions. Usually a proud and rugged people, they have dropped even the pretense of tenacity. They are begging.

Famine is a gradual disaster, slowly depleting crops and cupboards, and when it finally arrives in its fullness, the world looks at the skeletal victims and wonders: How did it happen? Where were the warnings?

In Afghanistan -- afflicted with unending war and without an effectual government -- famine has been regularly dispatching its heralds. For three years running, drought has parched the fields, starved the farm animals and dried up the rivers. Hungry people, deprived of yet another harvest, have eaten what little seed they had kept in reserve.

In all, more than 700,000 people -- about 4 percent of Afghanistan's population -- have been on the move in a desperate migration, according to aid groups. They have flocked to the bigger towns and cities or crossed the border into Iran and Pakistan. More than one million are ""at risk of starvation,"" say, United Nations officials, pleading for emergency help.

Erick de Mul, the organization's relief coordinator for Afghanistan, defined ""at risk"" as ""death by outright starvation or weakening or epidemic in the next few months.""

For the most part, help is not on its way. The United Nations and many relief organizations have had trouble raising money for assistance. ""Donor fatigue"" is thought to be the problem, a weariness from two decades of Afghanistan's sequential woes.

""It's not a case of crying wolf; it's a case of the wolf always being at the door,"" said Hans-Christian Poulsen, who heads the United Nations humanitarian efforts in Herat.

Afghans have been at war for 22 years, first in an epic resistance against Soviet troops, then in factional, back-stabbing combat against each other. Most of the nation is now ruled by Taliban mullahs who offend the West with their stern interpretations of Islam and their unflagging hospitality to the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.

Nations donating aid are also skeptical about the dimensions of the crisis. For now, estimating the endangered population involves guesswork, with most presumed victims living in remote villages, unreachable by aid workers either because of the winter or the war.

Then as well, in Afghanistan it is often hard to distinguish between the bad times and the worse. Even without famine, more than one in four children die before the age of 5 and the average life expectancy is 44. Hunger has become a helpmate to other causes of death.

""We're about knee-deep into a crisis now, and the potential of it becoming shoulder- deep is very great,"" said Simon Richards, who runs the office in Herat for the charity Christian Aid. ""What we are seeing are displaced people pouring in, but they're actually the better off. They at least had the means to pay for transportation. Most people don't.""

Mr. Uddin, with his three sons now buried and his spirit in atrophy, paid about $12 a person for his family's ride in that open truck, packed so tightly that people had to take turns to sit down. His home is a village in Badghis Province.

""People are starving there,"" he said. ""I borrowed money to go, with my land as collateral."" He tugged at a thin tawny blanket that was draped over his shoulders and again relived his worst memory. ""It was very, very cold in the Sabzak Pass.""

Day after day, the big trucks arrive, people and possessions piled in a disorderly heap. Six camps have been set up in and around Herat, the largest being Maslakh, 12 miles away in a treeless stretch of windswept land.

Another vehicle from Badghis rumbles in, this one with farmers from a different village but a story that was much the same. Muhammad Ramazan had lost two children, ages 5 and 3, during the frigid journey. He too was wrapped in a thin blanket. A safety pin substituted for buttons on his shirt.

""We were on top of the truck, and we could never cover ourselves properly,"" he said.

For the first time, he took a good look around, surveying where two weeks of hard travel had brought him: Maslakh, 40,000 people in a four-mile sprawl of small tents and mud shelters. A ragged line of the hungry -- their faces grim and their postures slumped -- were waiting for gruel.

Mr. Ramazan hoped that the recent misfortunes suffered by himself and his companions might merit special consideration. He led a frenzied tour of the distressed.

""That man lost a daughter,"" he cried out, pointing emphatically. ""And here is another child who is dying. And this woman here, look at her. She will die, too, yes?""

He pulled a blanket off what had first appeared to be a satchel. Underneath was a woman on her knees, with her head bent down until it almost touched the ground. She was alive, if unmoving, her body petrified by days in the cold. He lifted her head by the hair.

""I cannot imagine she will not die,"" he insisted.

Finally, he displayed an 80-year-old man named Bismilla, who had fallen off the truck seven nights before and now no longer spoke. Much of his skin had turned black.

""Maybe he will die too, but God knows better,"" Mr. Ramazan said.

Herat, in western Afghanistan, is an ancient city on an historic trade route. Its architecture includes one of the world's great mosques and the remnants of several exquisite minarets. In the predawn of Feb. 21, as a cruel rain mocked people who had fled from drought, five children died in an impromptu camp beside those slender towers, near the center of the city.

The location, entirely without cover, held about 1,000 people, a backlog of the newly arrived who had yet to be ""registered"" for the meager entitlements of a dwelling and 15 pounds of wheat. None of the authorities distributing the food or tarpaulins seemed aware of their presence, though many of these haggard people had arrived a week before.

In the early morning chill, as women fed twigs into small fires and tried to make tea, shivering people huddled forlornly under damp blankets. There was a strange drone in the air, a blending of sobs and chatter and coughing.

""All my children are sick,"" moaned Abdul Aziz, a man too tired to stand. ""We came here because we had nothing. We walked a great distance in the snow. And still we have nothing. Look at my little daughter shivering.""

Nearby, a cadaverous old woman heard these laments and became envious. ""No one is as sick as I am,"" she complained, wobbling to her feet. There were sores around her lips and holes in her shoes. She wheezed. ""Come and see, I am barely alive.""

Coordination between the Taliban and the aid groups has been a vexation for both. Government officials portray themselves as the good guys in white turbans, and they are quick to suspect that not all donations to the aid groups are properly spent.

Syed Raz Muhammad is the forceful man who oversees relief operations for the Taliban's ministry of martyrs and repatriation. He greets foreign guests with a welcoming hand over his heart and a cup of tea, but he can be abruptly dismissive about what he considers the paucity of international concern.

""Our people are given enough bread to stay alive, nothing more,"" he said, sitting before a kerosene-burning heater in his office. ""Soon, we will have another 100,000 people coming to Herat, and when the weather gets hot, water and sanitation will be the problem instead of cold, and we will have cholera and tuberculosis and other diseases.""

Overburdened international aid workers, themselves unsatisfied with their resources, kowtow to the Taliban's dictums and whimsies. Many of them say they have become resigned to paying bribes to perform their altruistic labor.

At present, the six camps here seem to have enough tents and hovels, though this was not so at the end of January when a freak storm smacked Herat with snow and sub-zero cold, killing at least 150 people -- most of them children. The disaster received media attention, with cameras aimed at the small graves in the rocky cemeteries. Soon after, both the United States and Norway sent in shipments of blankets and tents.

The amount of aid remains modest, however, and allocating the limited supplies has sometimes created peculiar difficulties. The 324 tents donated by Norway are outfitted with double insulation and heaters. They are ""too nice to give out,"" said Mr. Poulsen of the United Nations. ""People would fight over them. There might be a riot.""

Spare as the camps are, relief workers are concerned about the ""pull factor,"" worried that if too much aid is given, this will lure people who are less needy.

For the moment, neighboring Pakistan, a traditional catch basin for fleeing Afghans, has addressed this anxiety by shunting 60,000 refugees into the purposefully deplorable Jalozai camp, 25 miles south of Peshawar in Pakistan's northwest.

People there live in the stark openness under nothing more than thin plastic sheets strung to poles. Little is given them. They purchase the plastic from vendors at 20 cents a meter. Women spin wool into yarn to earn money, but a day's pay is only barely an antidote for hunger, enough for the purchase of five loaves of flat bread.

Traditionally, men do not do such work, so instead they stand around idly, waiting for something to fetch their attention away from the melancholia. ""A tractor has run someone over!"" one man yelled recently, initiating a stampede among the bored.

At Jalozai, the temperature still dips in the evenings, and almost any gust is enough to lift the plastic walls off their moorings. Still, Peshawar's weather is more benign than that of Herat, where the cold has been such an essential part of the mass grief.

Last Friday, just before morning prayers opened the day at Maslakh, Mir Ali used the dim glow of his flashlight to see how his ailing 1-year-old son, Abdullah, had fared during the night.

A few days before, the chill and wetness had conspired in the baby's chest and left him breathing with a rasp. A doctor had given the family some tablets and syrup with penicillin and told them to keep the boy warm. They bundled him in his hooded jacket, the one with pink roses on a field of green, then covered him with blankets. For a time, in the darkness after midnight, they kept a flame going with wood scraps in a metal pot.

But the boy did not survive. ""I don't know exactly when he died,"" the father said quietly. His sorrow had transported him into a daze. ""We must buy a shroud for the funeral, but we have no money.""

He was surrounded by fellow villagers, from Jilga Mazar in Ghor province. They took up a collection to raise the required sum, about $1. Finally, with the proper white cloth in hand, Mr. Ali took his son from the family's mud hovel, leaving behind the baby's weeping mother and sisters who, by custom, could not attend the burial.

Abdullah looked like a child's doll in his perfect stillness. He was brought across the road and laid gently on a piece of yellow plastic. The father slowly tore off the boy's clothes -- the parka, a green shirt, a good luck charm worn around the neck. Another man washed the baby with shampoo, rinsing the suds with water poured from a black kettle. Dabs of perfume were applied from a little bottle. Abdullah was then wrapped, first in the shroud, then in a tan blanket.

The men carried this tiny bundle to one of the camp's four cemeteries. It was a mile walk through the breeze. There, the baby was set down on a flat patch of ground while the prayerful removed their shoes and faced West. A mullah, with appropriate gravity, chanted, ""God is great,"" followed by another man who sang a verse from the Koran. The scriptural passage spoke of life's mortality and promised that the pious will ultimately know the blessings of Allah.

When it was time to lay Abdullah in his grave, it was already after 10 and the morning had turned bright. Wrapped in the shroud, and with the day pulsing with sunlight, the baby was finally warm when he was placed forever in the earth."
72,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"Blasphemy is a capital crime in this volatile Islamic nation, so Dr. Younus Shaikh, while teaching at a medical college, might have wisely avoided any discussion of the personal hygiene of the holy Prophet Muhammad.

But the topic came up during a morning physiology class. And the doctor talked briefly about seventh-century Arabia and its practices regarding circumcision and the removal of underarm hair. Some students found his remarks deeply offensive. ""Only out of respect, because he was our teacher, did we not beat him to death on the spot,"" said Syed Bilal, 17.

Instead, they informed a group of powerful mullahs, who in turn filed a criminal complaint. Lest the matter be treated with insufficient urgency, these clerics dispatched a mob to the medical school and the police station, threatening to burn them down.

Precisely what Dr. Shaikh said in class last October is now a matter of mortal dispute, but he has been jailed ever since, awaiting trial and pondering the noose. Defending himself presents a conundrum. What can he safely say?

Pakistan, a nearly bankrupt nation with 150 million people, a military government and an expanding nuclear arsenal, is drifting toward religious extremism. Blasphemy cases are its version of the Salem witch trials, with clerics sniffing out infidels, and enemies using the law to settle personal scores.

Accurate crime statistics are a low priority here, but the number of those imprisoned on blasphemy charges is estimated in the hundreds. Only the most sensational cases get much notice: when vigilantes murder the accused, or the bold judge who set him free. When a man is condemned to die if a few pages in the Koran are torn. When a newspaper is shut down after publishing a sacrilegious letter.

Dr. Shaikh is charged under Provision 295-C of the law: the use of derogatory remarks about the holy Prophet Muhammad. Whether such an offense is intentional or not, the mandatory punishment is death.

""Please understand, I am a deeply religious man,"" Dr. Shaikh said recently, professing his Islamic faith through the tight wire mesh of a jail cell. A short, rumpled man, he had the weary look of someone trying to rub a disturbing dream from bleary eyes. ""I cannot even imagine blaspheming our holy Prophet, peace be upon him.""

Few Pakistanis have heard of Dr. Shaikh, but news of his woes has leapt the borders, flitting across the Internet. He is associated with the International Humanist and Ethical Union, which describes itself as an ""umbrella organization for humanist, rationalist, agnostic, skeptic, atheist and ethical culture groups around the world."" In 1999, he gave a presentation at the World Humanist Congress.

In an attempt to save the doctor, a global letter-writing campaign was quickly begun, with pleas aimed at Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler. Publicity, on the other hand, has been discouraged.

The hope was that persistent statesmanship would outlast righteous anger, with the charges then quietly disappearing. This hushed approach has proved a frustration, however, and after declining earlier requests for an interview, Dr. Shaikh agreed to speak of his case.

""My statements about the holy Prophet, peace be upon him, were made in his praise only, and these have now been twisted out of context,"" he said in measured phrases.

Moments later, pressed for specifics, he said: ""My students asked me about the shaving of pubic and armpit hair, and I, in describing the glory of Allah's revelations, said that before the arrival of Islam, the Arabs did not have these practices. And they did not.""

Before his troubles, Dr. Shaikh lived alone in a small room in Islamabad. He had studied medicine in both Pakistan and Ireland but his practice had long periods of interruption. He preferred academic research and his passion has been ""the history of nations."" After the Koran, he said, the important books in his life have been the Encyclopedia Britannica and ""The Story of Civilization,"" by Will and Ariel Durant.

Pakistan may have an ample supply of free thinkers, but free speakers have long been on the wane. Governments -- civilian or military -- tend to imprison opponents. Federal laws enforce a mix of mosque and state, and questions of religion are often presumed to have a single right answer, like arithmetic.

""Before saying anything in this country, you must always be aware of the forum, the place and the time,"" said Afrasiab Khattak, head of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. ""If accused of blasphemy, you are in great difficulty. The mullahs are not known for their generosity. Even if exonerated, you will always be in danger.""

Dr. Shaikh was a member of peace and environmental groups. But while he might have asked an occasional dissenting question at a public seminar, he was not a well-known activist. His few writings have appeared mostly in cyberspace, and at least some of them accuse organized religion of mass murder, bigotry and the degradation of women. (Supporters have now removed most of this material from the Internet.)

Last fall, as Dr. Shaikh worked part time at a small clinic, he accepted a teaching job at the Capital Homeopathic Medical College, on the second floor of a shopping plaza. He had no expertise in homeopathic cures, but his subject was physiology and he knew that well enough. He was paid $89 a month.

However badly it ended, Dr. Shaikh's brief tenure was not a contentious one. Students liked him. If he had a fault, they said, it was for lectures that meandered into irrelevancies like poetry or free sex in Western countries.

Occasionally, Dr. Shaikh's digressions embarrassed his students; occasionally, they seemed impious. One irksome topic was how Muslims had come to practice circumcision and, for purposes of cleanliness, the removal of pubic and underarm hair. A question arose: Had Muhammad been circumcised before receiving God's revelations at age 40?

The ensuing discussion brought on no great ado, and Dr. Shaikh said he only remembers saying, ""The Prophet's tribe did not practice circumcision.""

But the offended students repeat a different version.

""He told us the Prophet hadn't been circumcised before,"" insisted Majid Lodhi, 22. ""We asked, 'In what book is this knowledge?' And he said, 'I'm telling you the way it was, and if you have evidence to the contrary, bring in your proof.' ""

Outside of school, the students had begun talking about Dr. Shaikh. Was he uttering blasphemies? they asked each other. And if so, what should a good Muslim do?

""I had heard from the sermons in the mosques that those who blaspheme deserve to be killed immediately,"" said Asghar Ali Afridi, who at 28 was older than most students and whose views were persuasive. ""It was a weakness of faith that we did not do it.""

But 11 students, the entire class, did sign a letter that listed Dr. Shaikh's possible crimes. They claimed he had said that the Prophet was not a Muslim until age 40; that before then, he did not remove his underarm hair or undergo circumcision; that he first wed, at 25, without an Islamic marriage contract; that his parents were not Muslims.

Mr. Afridi was picked to deliver the letter to the Movement for the Finality of the Prophet, a group well known for pursuing blasphemers.

""For Dr. Shaikh's own protection, we sought his arrest,"" said Abdul Wahid Qasmi, secretary general of the organization's Islamabad chapter. ""Otherwise, he might have been killed in the streets.""

The Movement's vigilance is most often directed at Ahmadis, who regard themselves as Muslims but believe another prophet appeared after Muhammad. By law, they are barred from linking themselves in any way to Islam. Each year, many are arrested for simply reciting a Koranic verse or using the greeting ""Salaam aleikum.""

Non-Muslims make up about 3 percent of Pakistan's population, and while they have obvious reasons to fear the blasphemy statutes, there is no shortage of opposition among Muslims as well. Even a strong advocate, the minister for religious affairs, Mahmood Ahmad Ghazi, says the law requires revision. He has reviewed numerous cases and said the majority originate from ""ill will and personal prejudice.""

Last year, General Musharraf himself called for a procedural change, suggesting that the merits of blasphemy cases be reviewed by local officials before an arrest. But when fundamentalists took to the streets in protest, he backed down.

At the Movement's headquarters, the law also comes under criticism, though the complaint is of sluggish justice. Blasphemers may get locked up, but not one has been executed.

""Even if someone is only half-conscious when speaking against the Prophet, he must die,"" said Mr. Qasmi, who managed to sound amiable. ""In Dr. Shaikh's case, his relatives have come to see us, saying the man is sorry and that he repents. But to be sorry now is not enough. Even if a man is sorry, he must die.""

These days, Dr. Shaikh calls himself an ""Islamic humanist,"" stressing the adjective. This surge in devotion is a return to his roots; he comes from a religious family in Bahawalnagar, and his father, a merchant, is a hafiz, a man who has memorized the Koran.

In hiring a lawyer, the family has steered away from human rights types. Its attorney takes a rather omnibus approach. First, there is a technicality to exploit. The students should have filed the charges instead of the mullahs, he asserts. Second, his client never said the things alleged, and even if he did, the words are not blasphemous.

A judge will decide. And customarily, the accusing party packs the courtroom with zealots in a show of righteous concern. The Shaikh family, however, has no intention of being steamrolled by hostile fundamentalists. At a recent hearing, they brought their own mullahs -- equally bearded, equally turbaned, equally able to quote from holy books.

""No blasphemy has been committed in this case,"" proclaimed Maulana Abdul Hafiz. An elderly, stern-faced man, he, too, heads a chapter of the Movement for the Finality of the Prophet, his being in Bahawalnagar. ""Blasphemy can be committed only if issues are raised about the period after the holy Prophet declared his prophethood. These issues are pre-prophethood.""

The mullahs from Bahawalnagar say they have tried to reason with the mullahs from Islamabad, but these efforts have failed. ""They know we are right but they do not want to backtrack and lose face,"" said Maulana Hafiz, enraged by his adversaries.

How dare they? he declared: ""They tell us that we ourselves should be cautious, that protecting a blasphemer is as bad as blaspheming itself."""
73,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"The evidence considered most damning includes Bibles translated into Farsi and Pashto, dozens of video and audio tapes about the life of Jesus and a book entitled ""Sharing Your Faith With a Muslim.""

Two weeks ago, 24 aid workers -- 2 Americans, 2 Australians, 4 Germans and 16 Afghans -- were arrested here in this nation's war-ravaged and hunger-racked capital. Some were accused of preaching the Christian Gospel. Others were accused of listening too well.

Death may be the punishment for these crimes -- or at least that is what officials from the ruling Taliban militia have announced. In Afghanistan, laws are in constant flux as austere mullahs fine-tune their ideas for creating the world's purest Islamic state.

""These foreigners were given visas as aid workers, not missionaries,"" said Abdul Ghafoor Afghani, the Taliban's chief of protocol. ""In your country, if I am given a diplomat's visa and I am caught spying, I would not be spared, yes? This is the same.""

""We have taken some confessions,"" he said. ""The two American women were caught, as you say, red- handed, in an Afghan's house, where they know they were not to go. They were trying to show a video about Jesus, from his birth to his, what is the word, I think it is crucifixion.""

In its fourth year of remorseless drought, in its 22nd year of relentless war, Afghanistan may well be the world's neediest country. The United Nations and hundreds of relief groups provide help that now amounts to more than $300 million a year. But those organizations and the Taliban are often incompatible caretakers, steeped in cultural conflicts and mutual distrust. One dispute follows another, and it seems that when the aid agencies are not threatening to pack it in, the mullahs are threatening to throw them out.

The Taliban are uncomfortable with much of what goes on behind the high walls of the aid workers' compounds: the mingling of unmarried men and women, the beat of rock 'n' roll, the ending of a hard day with a stiff drink. The unseen is often tolerated, though some activities worry the mullahs more than others. Repeatedly, the Taliban have warned against turning Afghan believers into Afghan apostates.

""These laws were well-known to everyone,"" said Fayaz Shah, head of the United Nations World Food Program in Kabul. ""It's like walking in a minefield, and when one blows, you yell, `Why did this happen?' But you should know. You were in a minefield.""

The arrested aid workers belong to Shelter Now, a German-based group. For months, its Kabul staff had been under the surveillance of the Taliban's whip-wielding religious police from the Department for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. An intensive investigation has been opened, and the authorities have announced the possibility of ""a larger conspiracy.""

A prime suspect is the World Food Program itself, Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil said on Tuesday. He did not specify how a reliable donor of wheat might be linked to the conversion of Muslims, but the mere mention of such misgivings is a grave matter. The program is the sole source of nourishment for three million Afghans, about 15 percent of the population. Those woebegone people survive on little more than flatbread and weak tea.

The potential of more arrests has left the aid agencies in fear. People say the Shelter Now episode could eventually lead to a huge withdrawal -- or expulsion -- of the agencies. That would be catastrophic for the needy.

That dreadful prospect complicates the moral judgments of aid workers who would ordinarily ache with sympathy for their jailed colleagues. As it is, commiseration often is coupled with anger. Many people here presume that the arrested foreigners were guilty of reckless proselytizing; however well-intentioned the preaching, that forbidden endeavor to save a few dozen souls has imperiled thousands of lives.

""Why did they break the law, especially this law?"" asked an American who insisted on anonymity. ""Worse yet, they dragged their Afghan workers into this. After some political games, the foreigners will probably be kicked out of the country as their punishment. But the Afghans, I am afraid they are going to be killed.""

Peter Schwittek, who runs an aid group that operates schools in mosques, said he once spoke about proselytizing with George Taubmann, a fellow German who heads Shelter Now in Kabul. ""If you discuss these things with Mr. Taubmann, he tells you, `No, we never formally evangelize, but if our staff feels compelled to do so, O.K., but it's not a policy of our agency.' ""

The first to be arrested were the two American women, taken away on Aug. 3. Their names are Dana Curry and Heather Mercer, and they are said to be in their mid-20's. Anxious parents have arrived in Pakistan, hoping to get visas to Kabul. Still ahead will be heart-rending details about young and adventurous zealots aspiring to do good deeds.

On Aug. 5, Mr. Taubmann himself was arrested along with dozens of others, including a large assemblage of Afghan children who were later released.

""Some of the Shelter Now people have claimed that all their Christian materials were for personal use,"" said Mr. Afghani, the chief of protocol, ""but I do not believe one needs thousands of audio cassettes to make a study of the Pashto language.""

""Of the Afghans, some are said to have been teachers of the others, and to do that I would think they must be considered converts who by Shariat law face execution,"" he said.

Though the Taliban control nearly all of the country, most of the world declines to recognize them as a legitimate government. In return, the Taliban have now refused the customary right of consular access to the imprisoned foreigners.

On Tuesday, diplomats from the United States, Australia and Germany left Kabul in frustration after a week of fruitless attempts to see their countrymen. They were allowed only to pass on supplies from the aid workers' families: toiletries, writing materials, Oreo cookies, Pringles potato chips and a variety pack of Nature Valley crunchy granola bars.

""There doesn't appear to be a well- defined legal system here, at least for this case,"" said David T. Donahue, the exasperated American envoy. ""We've been told that once the investigation is complete, it will be turned over to Mullah Omar, the supreme leader.""

If the reclusive, one-eyed Mullah Muhammad Omar is indeed the last word, he might consult his own Edict No. 14, a July 31 decree concerning the behavior of foreign nationals. It regards ""inviting Afghans to any religion apart from Islam"" as a less serious offense than ""taking photographs of living creatures"" or ""eating the meat of the pig."" Punishment is 3 to 10 days in prison and then expulsion.

But the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a work in progress, not yet five years old. The rules for behavior are singularly constraining, and yet there always seems more to add. In March, even small boys were commanded to wear turbans to school. In May, two giant statues of Buddha -- an ancient heritage -- were destroyed because they depicted the human form. In June, spectators at soccer matches were ordered to restrict their cheers to the chant ""God is great!""

By and large, the Taliban leadership hails from refugee camps, religious schools and villages, and their education has focused on the ideology of jihad and the wisdom of the Koran. For them, governance has been a confounding puzzle.

But now as they grow more accustomed to the reins, they also more resent the independence of the aid groups in their midst. In the past, much of this criticism involved lifestyle. The Taliban thought the aid workers were spendthrifts with donated money, drawing high salaries, driving expensive vehicles, living in large houses.

These days, the Taliban seem as intent on overseeing budgets and planning as behavior. With millions being spent, they want to sign off on projects and look at the books. In a recent interview, Mullah Muhammad Hassan, the powerful governor of Kandahar Province, rebuked the United Nations for squandering money.

""The U.N. is paying $2,156 per tube well, and I can have them dug for $500,"" he said, rooting through his pockets for the scraps of paper that held his arithmetic.

In May, a beautiful and modern surgical hospital in Kabul closed within weeks of its opening. The builders, the Italian aid group Emergency, shut down to protest a raid by the religious police, who beat up some staff members after finding men and women lunching in the same room. But what has kept the hospital closed since then is a disagreement about whether the Afghan employees must be hired through the Ministry of Public Health.

""This is our country and we want things run with our consultation,"" said Mullah Muhammad Abbas Stanekzai, the deputy minister of health.

Kabul is a city of two million people, almost all destitute. In a civil war from 1989 to 1996, as many as seven armies blasted away at one another with artillery and rockets. Now much of the city looks like the detritus of an ancient ruin. At daybreak, the place seems ghostly until squatters lift themselves from the wreckage they use as nightly shelter.

These are people ordinarily grateful to the aid groups and slow to take the Taliban's side in conflicts. But they overwhelmingly support the arrest of the Christians and the jailing of any murtads, Muslims who have deserted their faith. If the price of bread and blankets is denial of the Holy Prophet, they say they would prefer to defiantly perish.

""These people supposedly came here to help the Afghan people, and instead they have used their position to do the dishonorable,"" said Ahmed, a young man with a beard already lengthy enough for a Biblical epic. ""I think these people should die.""

A 27-year-old soldier was equally emphatic about his deep beliefs. There is only one religion, he said. God sent Islam to refine the teachings of all other faiths. It is eternity's final word.

He then considered the gloriousness of this knowledge and said he wished to share it with all mankind. ""Converting someone to Islam is the greatest thing a person can do,"" he said. ""Such an act is a way to go straight to Heaven."""
74,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"If there are Americans clamoring to bomb Afghanistan back to the Stone Age, they ought to know that this nation does not have so far to go. This is a post-apocalyptic place of felled cities, parched land and downtrodden people.

The fragility of this country was part of the message the Taliban government conveyed in a plea for restraint issued late tonight.

It said in part, ""We appeal to the United States not to put Afghanistan into more misery because our people have suffered so much.""

Whatever Afghanistan's current cataclysm, its next one seems to require little time to overtake it. Wars fought by sundry protagonists have gone on now for 22 consecutive years, a remorseless drought for 4. Since 1996, most of the nation has been ruled by Taliban mullahs whose vision of the world's purest Islamic state has at least as much to do with controlling social behavior as vouchsafing social welfare.

The accused terrorist Osama bin Laden has found a home here, angering much of the world. In 1998, America fired a volley of more than 70 cruise missiles at guerrilla training camps reportedly operated by the Saudi multimillionaire. Now, there seems to be the prospect of another barrage, with Afghan hospitality to the same man as the cause.

As fear of an American attack mounted, the Taliban's senior spokesman in Kandahar, Abdul Hai Mutmain, called the few foreign reporters here to issue the statement, which in part defended Mr. bin Laden:

""These days, Osama bin Laden's name has become very popular and to an extent it has become a symbol. These days, even to the common people, Osama bin Laden's name is associated with all controversial acts. Osama bin Laden does not have such capabilities. We still hope sanity prevails in the United States. We are confident that if a fair investigation is carried out by American authorities, the Taliban will not be found guilty of involvement in such cowardly acts.""

The statement also said, ""Killing our leaders will not help our people any. There is no factory in Afghanistan that is worth the price of a single missile fired at us. It will simply increase the mistrust between the people in the region and the United States.""

Whatever else there is to say about this entreaty, one part that is indisputably true is that this land-locked, ruggedly beautiful nation is in absolute misery.

Here in Kabul, the capital, roaming clusters of widows beg in the streets, their palms seemingly frozen in a supplicant pose. Withered men pull overloaded carts, their labor less costly than the price of a donkey.

Children play in vast ruins, their limbs sometimes wrenched away by remnant land mines. The national life expectancy, according to the central statistics office, has fallen to 42 for males and 40 for females.

The prolonged drought has sent nearly a million Afghans -- about 5 percent of the population -- on a desperate flight from hunger. Some have gone to other Afghan cities, others across the border. More than one million are ""at risk of starvation,"" according to the United Nations.

Famine is the catastrophe Afghans are used to hearing about. Few yet know of the threat of an American reprisal. The Taliban long ago banned television, and the lack of electricity keeps most people from listening to radio.

The nation's 100 or so foreign aid workers suffer no such telecommunications handicaps, however, and today many of them began to flee their adopted home, fearing either the havoc of American bombs or the wrath of subsequent Afghan outrage.

Around noon, a special United Nations flight evacuated the first of the expatriates. The remaining foreigners are expected to leave on Thursday, as will three, and perhaps all four, of the American parents here to observe the trial of their children, among eight foreign aid workers accused by the Taliban of preaching Christianity.

As foreigners left, the Taliban took unusual precautions: they began searching every vehicle entering government compounds. Visitors were carefully frisked.

But however much the Taliban hierarchy was beginning to fret, streets and bazaars were a picture of normality. Word has spread slowly about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. And even when everyday Afghans heard the news, there were no accompanying video images to sear the horror into their memories. Personal conversations only carried the dull stimuli of abstract words: hijacked planes and collapsed buildings.

Khair Khana, a man selling fertilizer in a market, knew just a bit about the attack. He thought a plane had crashed into the White House. And he considered the perpetrators, whoever they are, to be ""enemies of God,"" though he also felt ""Americans should look into their hearts and minds about why someone would kill themselves and others"" in such a way.

He had not thought much about an American retaliation against Afghanistan. When he did consider it, standing in a ramshackle collection of stalls, he shrugged and said: ""Americans are powerful and can do anything they like without us stopping them.""

Nearby, a tailor, Abdul Malik, saw God's justice in America's pain because, as he understands it, the United States has armed the Afghan resistance to fight against the Taliban. ""So they at least now know how it feels in their own country,"" he said.

As for Mr. bin Laden, the tailor considered judgment of him to be God's affair. ""If Osama is Islam's enemy, he should be gotten rid of,"" he said. ""But if he is a good Muslim and wants Islam to prosper -- and if America wants him dead -- then we hope he destroys America.""

The common people of Afghanistan are often circumspect with their opinions. As one man said today: ""Nobody here talks wholeheartedly any more; it can be dangerous.""

The Taliban are credited with improving safety. They disarmed the population, they put an end to banditry. But the security has come at a steep price.

Women have been forced into head-to-toe gowns known as burqas and evicted from schools and the workplace. Men are obligated to wear long beards or face jail. Banned are musical instruments, chessboards, playing cards, nail polish and neckties. Cheers at soccer matches are restricted to ""Allah-u-akbar,""or God is great. Freedom of speech has bowed to religious totalitarianism.

Various Taliban police forces patrol the streets. Today, in a derelict building that is used as a precinct office, one 25-year-old constable sat on the floor beneath a single dangling light bulb. His name was Muhammad Anwar. He had heard something about the attack in America but he had no idea how many were killed or what cities were involved. Indeed, it seemed unlikely that he had ever heard of New York.

""Attacks like these are not a good thing because Muslims live all over the world and Muslims may have been killed,"" Mr. Anwar said hesitantly. By his reckoning, Americans were enemies of Afghanistan, as were Jews and Christians. He thought about this a bit more and retracted it partially. ""There must have been all kinds of people in the building, not just bad Jews but good Jews, not just bad Christians but good ones.""

He remembered something he had learned in his madrassa, or religious school. ""It is un-Islamic to kill innocent people,"" he said."
75,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"For years, Pakistan has seemed a place about to blow. Bankruptcy is at the door; angry mullahs are at the gate. The corruption of the powerful is epic, the poverty of the masses crushing. The army has taken charge, again putting democracy on the shelf. More people own guns than refrigerators.

This country, then, may seem a strange choice as America's indispensable ally in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Islamic guerrillas -- many would call them terrorists -- openly operate inside Pakistan's borders, with government support. But for the Bush administration, Pakistan it is -- a rediscovered crony from America's cold war days, forced back into friendship at gunpoint to fight terrorism. In his Sept. 19 speech to the nation, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler for the last two years, explained that he was facing an American ultimatum -- join us or fight us -- and that he felt that the country's very survival was at risk.

In many ways, it is. The country is polarized. On one side stand sympathizers with the West who have felt increasingly marginalized in recent years and believe that the current turmoil may be a rare stroke of fortune that halts the ""Talibanization"" of Pakistan, a drift toward the fundamentalist Islam of neighboring Afghanistan. On the other stand the holy warriors, the hope of the country's myriad dispossessed.

Pakistan, with a population between 140 million and 150 million, is the world's seventh most populous country. Like many nations in the third world, it seems to be simultaneously moving ahead and falling behind at frantic speeds. It is this dichotomy that explains some of the violence of the country's conflicts.

Today, someone claiming to be from one of the best-known of Pakistan's radical Islamic guerrilla groups, Jaish-e-Muhammad, took responsibility for a suicide bombing at the state legislature in Srinagar, in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack killed at least 26 people.

One of this region's many open secrets is that the Pakistani government itself has armed Islamic militants, sending them off to fight the Indian authorities in Kashmir in an attempt to wrest the contested Himalayan territory, which is primarily Muslim, from Hindu control.

A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a statement today, condemned the Srinagar attack. ""Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" he said.

But whatever the government's past relationship to Jaish-e-Muhammad, it seems clear that the United States, in its new determination to combat terrorism, has sided with a military government that has not been averse to backing insurgency in Kashmir.

Radical Muslim political parties, historically weak at the polls, are traditionally potent in the streets, where the number of poor and the number of refugees grow. Kalashnikovs are everywhere, as are men who know how to use them. Twin jihads -- one in Afghanistan, one in Kashmir -- save many from the idle hours of joblessness and fill them with lethal, self-righteous purpose.

But the radical Islamists drawn to holy war, however grateful for their supply of guns and grenades, very often despise the national leaders who provide them. The more those Pakistani leaders look like American cronies working to oust the Taliban government in Afghanistan, the more the hate may grow.

By drafting this fragile and fractious nation into a central role in the ""war on terrorism,"" America runs the danger of setting off a cataclysm in a place where civil violence is a likely bet and nuclear weapons exist.

Pakistan has long been the speculated locale for one of the world's worst nightmare scenario, in which Islamic terrorists, in league with rogue elements of the military, seize control of the government and wield the vengeful sword of jihad with a nuclear tip.

Islam is a growing force here. Hundreds of religious schools, known as madrassahs, have eagerly sent their students to fight at the Taliban's side. Pakistani border guards wish them well as they head to the front lines.

Last Friday, in a drama repeated in hundreds of towns and cities across the country, mullahs at the Red Mosque in Islamabad followed the gentle chanting of afternoon prayers with frenzied threats of violence: Death to America! Let Americans come here to be buried!

A plea went out for 50,000 volunteers to defend Afghanistan against ""the infidels."" The entreaty was made with the desperate ardor of merchants at a going-out-of-business sale. Many of Pakistan's fundamentalist clerics endorse the Taliban's formula for a pure Islamic state. Without the Taliban, these mullahs would be without their rallying point.

An 18-year-old spectator, Tai Muhammad, said he had pledged his life to the anti-American jihad, enlisting at the mosque's sign-up table. ""People like me will be the Americans' reception committee,"" he said, grinning in satisfaction.

Lambasted along with President Bush was General Musharraf, called a traitor to his country, his religion and 1,400 years of Islamic history.

Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden's sanctuary, is not merely Pakistan's neighbor. Pakistani intelligence agents have been the Taliban's godfathers, turning a throng of self-righteous religious students into a militia of self-assured soldiers.

Until recently, the Taliban have been useful to Pakistan, providing an ally on its western flank as rival India lurks to the east, and a breeding ground for Islamic militancy that could be redirected toward Kashmir.

So to many at the Red Mosque, Pakistan's cooperation with America seems like a sellout.

American money, of course, is not an insignificant inducement, especially to a nation $37 billion in debt with virtually no prospects of climbing out of the hole.

So far, a windfall has yet to appear, though America -- suddenly forgiving of the testing of nuclear weapons and the eschewing of democracy -- has removed many economic sanctions against Pakistan. Together with the Japanese, the United States has rescheduled nearly $1 billion in debt and authorized $90 million in aid.

Indeed, renewed solvency is the hope of many Pakistanis who believe that a decisive battle has at last been joined.

""It's a wonderful thing,"" said a retired general, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We were in a state of drift. The silent majority was being dragged in a terrible direction by a very vocal minority. This is God-sent. We're saved.""

That optimistic view is shared by much of a Westernized elite that would see the Taliban's overthrow as the logical halt to the onrushing fundamentalism in their own midst.

Many have long assumed that an upheaval was inevitable, with moderate Islam battling the religion's extremist, intolerant version.

That confrontation is better fought now than later, they say. ""If there is a silver lining in this, it's that the radicals, the jihadists, will be de-fanged now instead of 10 years later when they'd be stronger,"" said Pervez Hoodbhoy, a physicist and peace activist.

But radicalism has deep social roots here. In the cities, the turn of a street corner can seem to be time travel between centuries. Wide boulevards clogged with expensive cars become narrow lanes where shrouded women carry jugs of water on their heads.

About 75 percent of all Pakistanis reside in rural areas. Most are sharecroppers, eking out a subsistence. In some areas, feudal families still hold sway, making private laws and operating private jails

While the wealthy send their children to college in America or Britain, many of the poor are deprived of even an elementary education. The literacy rate is below 40 percent. A fifth of Pakistan's government schools are ""ghosts,"" with buildings but no students or teachers, General Musharraf himself admitted. This void increasingly has been filled by thousands of madrassahs. Considered a godsend by the destitute, they feed and house their pupils while teaching them the wisdom of the Koran and the moral requirement to fight in holy wars.

Islam is the great refuge of Pakistan's masses. In mosques, in the fields, on the roadsides, men drop to their knees and perform their daily prayers. However empty their pockets, they are equal in these genuflections before God.

But it is not a simple picture. Fundamentalist Muslims, like secular ones, are minorities. Between them are a multitude of gradations in the practices of faith -- one reason why recent polls suggest layers of ambivalence about the current crisis,

Before General Musharraf's address to the nation on Friday, the pollster asked people whom they would support in a war between America and Afghanistan. Seven percent said America and 67 percent Afghanistan, with about 26 percent neutral. Four days after the speech, those who said they would side with the United States remained the same, though 20 percent shifted from Afghanistan to neutrality.

Some of this sentiment reflects a general doubt that America has enough proof against Mr. bin Laden to warrant a punishing attack on Afghanistan. At the same time, many Pakistanis are merely wary of America, regarded as a companion of shallow sincerity.

""Unfortunately, America seems to be Pakistan's friend only when it suits America's needs,"" said Zahid Mahmood, a bank manager. ""When the need is over, America deserts you.""

In the 1980's, America had great needs in the region. In late 1979, the Soviet Union sent its troops into Afghanistan, getting itself closer to a warm-water port. Using Pakistan as a pipeline, the United States and other nations then financed the Afghan resistance. The Soviets soon found themselves bogged down in a crippling war against guerrillas adept at mountain combat. The cold war's end swiftly followed the Soviets' humbling retreat in 1989.

America's attention span, as well its affection, did not last much longer. That was a shock to Pakistan.

Money had seemed a token of friendship, and in 1990 the United States aid package to Pakistan was $564 million; only Israel and Egypt received more. But then the largesse was suddenly withdrawn, the penalty for Pakistan's continuing program to develop nuclear weapons in pace with its archenemy India.

""Looking out for No. 1, that's the American way, isn't it?"" snickered Ajab Gul, a barber in Peshawar. ""That is what Americans are proud of. We're different.""

But the loyalties of Pakistanis are no simple matter, either.

In 1947, after a flurry of cartography, Pakistan and India were mapped out of the British Empire. Pakistan was devised with religious cohesion as a Muslim state. But it, rather than India, has been the one struggling for a national identity.

The country is split among several ethnicities and languages. Mr. Gul, the barber, is Pashtun and admits to feeling a greater affinity for the Pashtuns of Afghanistan than the Sindis of Karachi or the Punjabis of Lahore in his native land.

Democracy has never taken a firm foothold. The military has remained the dominant institution, and while it has failed in its three wars with India, it has had repeated success in overthrowing its own democratically elected governments.

During the 1990's, however, it was civilian governments that generally maintained control. The indefatigably corrupt governments of Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif -- as well the stopped-up American spigot -- helped plunge the economy into the red while at the same time discrediting democracy in the eyes of the people.

Both Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif now live in exile. Their political parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League, are in disarray. For now, public assembly is forbidden.

By order of the Supreme Court, a return to civilian government is supposed to occur by next October. General Musharraf, who recently assumed the title of president, has promised to abide by the timetable.

But his future, like his country's, is now linked to matters that could not have been foreseen a month ago: the number of American soldiers who will touch Pakistani soil, the amount of blood spilled in reflexive outrage, the havoc caused by the coming onrush of refugees and the furtive ability of a Saudi-born multimillionaire named Osama bin Laden."
76,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"On Monday, during four exhausting hours, a man named Asadullah trudged through the mountains, leading his 10 children out of Afghanistan. His right leg, a prosthesis of plastic, was chafing against the stump. But his discomfort, however great, was less than his wife's: Malika, atop a mule, was in labor.

""It was a very steep mountain, and I had to hold on very tight,"" she said today, sitting on a hard cot in the stuffy little tent where she finally gave birth. Her new daughter, just a human smidgen, lay asleep, swathed in a blanket.

Outside, Asadullah, a cobbler, was describing the journey. He unstrapped his false leg, showing where the edge had rubbed away his skin. The family came from Angoor Bagh, a village near Jalalabad, a city with targets that the United States military considers strategic.

""We were living too near the airport, I think,"" he said. ""One bomb shattered our windows. It was time to get out. The Pakistanis had announced they would open the border after the bombing began. We waited and waited for this. I was afraid to wait any more.""

About 1,000 to 2,000 Afghans are crossing into Pakistan each day, the United Nations estimates. They travel a hundred different smuggler routes, enduring hardships and paying bribes. Subject to deportation, they most often hide out in the homes of earlier arrivals, the two million Afghans who fled before them during two decades of turmoil.

""That man there, he is my brother-in- law,"" said Asadullah, who uses only one name.

He was pointing to Chinar Gul, Malika's brother, who left Afghanistan last winter. He now lives in New Shamshatoo, population 52,500, one of the many refugee camps that have been built near Peshawar in Pakistan's northwest. Until recently Mr. Gul presided over two cramped rooms, home to an extended family of 13, including nephews and widows.

Then, with the unexpected arrival of his sister and her still growing family, the simple mud dwelling became a domicile for 26. Then again, this morning another man abruptly showed up with his wife and three children. He was the brother-in-law of Mr. Gul's niece, which gave him a legitimate claim on space. Suddenly the two rooms and two hastily erected tents were housing 31.

""For a man with nothing, I am responsible for a lot of people,"" said Mr. Gul, feeling thunderstruck. He surveyed all that was before him, which included two dozen children. ""They have no bedding,"" he said. ""They have no winter clothes.""

Worst of all, neither they nor Mr. Gul had any food. Each refugee who was already registered at the camp -- something forbidden the newcomers -- was entitled to a monthly allotment of 33 pounds of wheat from the United Nations World Food Program. The family had nearly exhausted their ration and they had three more days to wait until they were allowed more.

That predicament, Mr. Gul said with assurance, was not a matter of overeating.

Rather, he blamed the quality of the wheat, which was reddish-brown and not very finely milled. It required sifting, he said. And once the husks were removed, only about two- thirds was left, the remainder being ""fodder fit only for animals.""

He brought out a nearly empty bag of the grain. On the outside it said ""USA Wheat.""

At Shamshatoo, a sprawling city of flat-roofed structures and dust-laden air, the complaint is a common one, whichever country has donated the wheat. People say they lose 10 to 50 percent of their ration in the sifting.

Commonly, nations donate money to help Afghan refugees, earmarking it for food. The wheat that is purchased is mostly grown and milled in Pakistan, said Azim Khan, who manages the assistance in the Shamshatoo camp for the World Food Program. ""It is not A-1 wheat, but it is reasonably good,"" he insisted.

Abdelwahab Mahmoud Jeme, a senior coordinator for the United Nations program, said strict quality control was enforced and the amount of ""whole meal,"" the undesired husk, was restricted to 3 to 5 percent.

Babar Samsoon, the project manager here for the aid group Shelter Now International, which distributes the wheat, said: ""These people always complain. I know refugees, and you can never make them happy.""

But today, as Shelter Now employees unloaded bag after bag, they themselves said some bags of wheat were of good quality while others were noticeably darker in color and contained a lot of husks.

Asadullah, exploring the camp, wondered what his new life as a refugee would bring.

""There are no bombs exploding here,"" he said. ""But I don't know that this is such a good place for us.""

He walked back up a hill to his brother-in-law's, where a decision had been made about food. They had pooled some money, using 40 cents to buy potatoes.

Between now and Thursday, this is what the 31 of them would eat."
77,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"In the raw gloom, Haziza, 12, helped find her mother and baby brother, dead in the rubble of their collapsed home.

It was early October, the first night of the American bombing of Kabul. The electricity had been cut. Searchers were desperately lighting pieces of paper, one after another, trying to burn away small patches of darkness.

In her mind's eye, the girl said she recalls two still bodies, ""their faces crushed and covered with blood.""

As she spoke, her eyes drifted left and she flinched, as if again in that moment, whether conjured from the stamp of memory or the elastic of imagination. She is a refugee now, having left everything behind but her thoughts.

""She seems unable to concentrate for long,"" said her teacher, a woman named Mullalai. ""Sometimes I look back at her and she is crying. So I go to her. But what is there to say?""

At the Ariana School here in Peshawar, the newly arrived students - the Afghans who have fled the American bombs - are easy to detect. They are anxious. They are mournful. They are withdrawn. And also, they are a head taller than the others in class.

Haziza is such a child. Five years ago, when the Taliban captured Kabul, she was in the first grade. The mullahs' inflexible rendering of Islam forbade girls to attend school. And so Haziza, with her education now hastily revived, is in the first grade still.

After a week, barely a page in her notebook is full. She lags behind her far smaller classmates. They already know the alphabet in Persian. Some know it in English as well.

""I feel very bad because I know less than the others and they are very much younger,"" Haziza said. ""I don't remember the things I was taught five years back.""

Visiting the school, there is an impulse to see a silver lining in Afghanistan's grim situation. For females, the fleeing from home, however sorrowful, comes with a counterweight of liberation. Girls can go back to school, women can again find work. For those who wish it, there is freedom from the mandatory head-to-toe sheathing of the burka.

But the cost of escape has been high, sometimes unbearably so.

As the new children at Ariana tell their stories, rueful themes repeat: the pummeling fury of the air raids, the uncoupling from all that is familiar, the exhausting journey over the mountains, the unremitting neediness of the refugee life.

Haziza's story is sad. ""We lived near the airport and were afraid,"" the girl said. ""My father took me and my brothers to a sturdier house nearby, but my mother said she was not afraid and only if things got dangerous, then she would come.""

Her father, a candy vendor, is a rumpled and sullen man with a tremor in his hands that makes it hard for him to hold a cup of tea. He and Haziza'a older brother independently tell the same details of the bombing and its grim aftermath.

The family now lives in the wretchedness of Tajabad, one of Peshawar's many squatter colonies that teem with Afghan refugees. Haziza sleeps on the dank concrete of their single room, the dampness tempered only by thin bed sheets. Around them is poverty's familiar cavalcade - naked children wallowing in mud, grown men despairing in idleness, chickens foraging in garbage heaps, sewage odors spoiling each breeze.

A relief worker directed Haziza to the Ariana School, where she showed up in the clothes of a ragamuffin and a face that collapsed into grief. She was given a pupil's proper uniform and a seat in one of the rear rows of an overcrowded first-grade classroom.

""She has lost five or six years to the Taliban,'' said Fauzia Habibi, the school's principal. ""Now she cannot concentrate. She and the other refugee children are always thinking about their country, where there is war. They tell us where America is attacking.""

Actually, most of the 2,300 students at the school are refugees, though only 300 are of the post-bombing period. Peshawar, 40 miles from the border, is a city with one million Afghans, an accumulated reservoir of humans from 23 years of crises.

Ariana is a private school where most students pay tuition. The newer refugees, attending free, sit among the others in one of three buildings. Some classes meet outdoors, with canvas as a roof and the grass for chairs. Students squeeze together on benches in the rooms inside. They arrive in shifts, the morning pupils, then the afternoon.

Farishta, 14, fled Kabul during the second week of October. Bombs had flattened houses near her own and terrified her, she said. Her family's escape came over the mountains, and she is still stunned by the abundance in Pakistan, the food and the clothes and the cars. At Ariana, she has been put in the fifth grade, where she left off in 1996.

""I don't know how to solve all the problems,'' Farishta said meekly, tightly tugging on a shawl that covered all but the pale oval of her face. ""I can do the plus and the minus, but the division seems too hard to understand.''

Farishta too lives in Tajabad. It is about an hour's walk from school, through the unfamiliar streets, around a corn field, across enormous ditches gouged into the earth. Her home, like most others in the slum, spills over with people. Her uncle is the main breadwinner, cutting pieces of rubber that are then shaped into cheap sandals.

On a clothesline in the yard hung a burka, now obsolete. Farishta's aunt, Mahtab, 20, had hated to don the Taliban's mandatory womenswear. She suffered eyestrain from looking out its meshed peephole, she said. It made her feel caged. She is glad to be done with it.

But it was the bombing that made her leave Kabul on Oct. 18. Her house was hit during a raid and her mother-in-law was killed by shrapnel, she said. ""It pierced her heart.""

She is angry at America, and when she is told that the United States is trying to minimize civilian casualties, she answered with a list of neighborhoods where innocents have been killed: Khuja Bughra, Maidan Hawai and others. Her patience wore away quickly at this subject. ""It is easier to understand if it is you being bombed,'' she said.

The years of Taliban rule have not only denied girls an education but boys as well. Their schools may have been open but very little teaching was going on. And when teaching did occur, religion very often replaced reading, writing and arithmetic in the curriculum.

""We would only study the Koran, trying to recite with the right Arabian accent,"" said Murtaza, a 10-year- old boy with gentle dark eyes. He tolerated a short pop quiz, giving the right answer for two plus two but the wrong one for 10 plus 10.

""I don't know this math,"" he said humbly.

Along with the 300 new students have come six new teachers, all women who lost their jobs when the Taliban barred women from work outside their homes. Two of them sat for a while in the school's office, telling of their losses and regrets. They were unforgiving of the Taliban. One teacher said her son had been taken away a year ago for the crime of trimming his beard. Another described being beaten for momentarily showing her face.

But in Peshawar, during these difficult days, the target of the harshest rebukes often flip-flop, going from the Taliban to the Americans and then back again.

Suddenly, a third teacher entered, sitting quietly and beginning to weep.

""I have learned our house in Kabul has been bombed,"" Naheeda Kohistani said, resting her forehead in her palms. ""I don't know if my brother and sister are still alive.""

She attempted to stifle her sobs, then pulsed with anger. ""How could the Americans think this was a military target?"" she asked. ""Or is it the Americans don't even care?""

An awkward silence hung in the room, and then she and the others finally returned to class, to rooms full of children eager to share in the rich knowledge of the world."
78,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"Troops of the Northern Alliance scrambled away in sudden retreat today after launching a misbegotten attack against a stubborn Taliban stronghold near the city of Maidan Shahr, just 12 miles west of Kabul.

While the defeat may be only a temporary setback, it exposes the vulnerability of the often disjointed alliance in terrain that is but a half- hour's drive from the capital.

Early this morning, as the sun nibbled away at the deep November chill, impatient soldiers from the alliance heard the command to attack, orders they had awaited all week.

Hundreds of men who had been huddling around wood fires since dawn quickly crowded aboard the nearest vehicles -- tanks, trucks and commandeered sedans -- advancing toward the occupied hills.

They were an enthusiastic lot as their first units circled the initial slope, supported by unanswered blasts of heavy artillery.

But then the Taliban abruptly hit back with small-arms fire from the hills and ridges beyond. The alliance's frontward soldiers dived for a series of ditches and gullies. They were pinned, inside the enemy's cross hairs.

A soldier named Amin was the first to die, taking a bullet in the right side of his chest. He collapsed backward as red began to glide down the green of his fatigues. Two of his comrades lifted the startled man to his knees.

He was then hoisted onto the back of another soldier who risked a similar fate to carry the dying man up the hill to their rear.

""Amin has 10 children,"" said a shaken soldier named Sherzai.

Within minutes, the faces of the alliance's troops, once so illumined with optimism, darkened with anxiety. The rear guard took cover behind the first hill, flattening themselves against the rocky steepness as bullets whistled over their heads and mortar fire hammered nearby.

They groused. ""The commander should not have had us run in so fast,"" one man said. He and the others watched a few of their commandoes try to circle to the east and board an armored personnel carrier.

Even that basic maneuver was ill- conceived. The waiting vehicle loaded within the enemy's range. Another soldier was shot.

As the morning continued to brighten under the now fierce sun, the battle seemed a standoff. Few soldiers ventured into the open, though the alliance took another casualty when its own mortar fire struck too close to its own troops.

The dead man, whose name was Esmat, was carried down the hill by six impromptu pallbearers. The load was awkward, shifting as the men stumbled on the loose incline, and they stopped every 50 feet or so to rest.

""That injured man must surely be badly hurt,"" said one soldier, observing the chore.

""That injured man is surely dead,"" another soldier corrected him.

By 11 a.m., three hours into the combat, an American B-52 raced through the skies, leaving a trail of white in its wake. Men peered upward, shielding their eyes with a row of fingers against their foreheads. They expected bombs to begin falling on the Taliban, but the plane flew past, its only payload being disappointment.

The standoff would only end an hour later as the Taliban, already having proved their mettle, launched a ground attack from the villages to the west. If this assault were successful, the soldiers on the hill would themselves be surrounded.

The reality of this seemed to dawn in a flash, and the alliance forces hurried back toward the dirt road, their Kalashnikovs strapped tightly across their shoulders and their cumbersome ammunition packs jouncing up and down.

""We were just testing the Taliban's strength and morale,"" said a retreating commander named Mahboob, trying a cheerful description of a dismal morning. By his count, the alliance had lost but a single soldier, though at least three -- and perhaps more -- had died.

Other commanders were more honest with assessments, saying that Haji Shir Alam, the overall head of the force, had attacked without much thought to strategy.

All week, the alliance forces in Maidan Shahr had awaited news about negotiations between their leaders and those of the Taliban, led by a commander named Ghulam Muhammad, alternately denounced by his opponents as a brutal butcher and duplicitous scoundrel.

The Taliban occupy a large area, covering most of Jalrez and Tarkana districts in Wardak Province, abutting Kabul. They are in retreat from the Shamali Plain, north of the capital. Their numbers are said to be in the high hundreds or low thousands. Mostly Pashtuns, their legions also include a significant share of Arabs and Pakistanis.

For many of the Pashtuns, the villages around Maidan Shahr are home. They are not only defending themselves but also their families. There is desperation in their task.

""The Taliban are very afraid of us,"" said Zaryaly, a unit commander for the alliance. ""They think the people from northern Afghanistan have come to take everything away from them. They don't want to give up. Certainly, they don't want to give up their guns."" That seems to be one stumbling block in talks. The Taliban appear to prefer an arrangement typical in Afghanistan in which the losers switch sides, keep their weapons and agree to let bygones be bygones until there is adequate reason to fight again.

In this instance, according to leaders of the alliance, Ghulam Muhammad would also like to be named as governor of the province, a steep asking price by a surrounded man.

But today the alliance showed itself to be no juggernaut that could enforce demands. Another attack here on the Taliban will likely require a coordinated assault from all sides -- and possibly American air support as well. The next try may be days away.

Abdul Wali, an 18-year-old soldier who was one of the last to retreat, seemed reluctant to leave at all. ""My good friend, he was wounded,"" he said. ""He is still up on the hill.""

That friend's name was Safiullah, and by Mr. Wali's telling, he, too, was hit by mortar fire from his own side. He looked back forlornly.

""So my friend is up there,"" he said, repeating himself and nodding toward the palette of browns in the distance. He looked back again, then again.

""I suppose he will die,"" he said, this time shrugging, his resignation now a match for his sorrow. ""Yes, that is what I suppose."""
79,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"Dr. Nazifa Tabibzada cut into the abdomen of someone named Abdul last week. It was a routine procedure for a reliable surgeon, remarkable only because she had not operated on a man in five years. Under the austere restraints of the Taliban, men and women were not permitted to mingle, even if one was under anesthesia.

Sabir Latifi, a businessman, also passed a threshold. Opening a cache in his home, he brought out 50 paintings that had been stolen from a storage room in the National Gallery. He had commissioned the theft after learning that the portraits were to be destroyed. The Taliban considered them sacrilegious. Art was not supposed to depict living things. Aziz Khaznavi, a renowned singer, freed himself from an imposed muteness. He rallied a dozen talented friends, and together they went to their hiding place for their dohls and surunders and other Afghan instruments. Then they breached the forbidden. They made music.

And so it continues, three weeks after the Taliban's exodus from Kabul. People are cauterizing the psychic wounds left by the religious police and resuming those parts of their lives outlawed by an uncompromising vision of Islamic purity.

Joy may be too strong a word for the common mood in Afghanistan's capital, for there is wariness of the future. The nation is once again riven into fiefs under the control of tribal chiefs and brutal warlords. What peace there is seems threadbare. But surely, at least for now, a shared sense of relief has embraced the city.

Gone are not only the Taliban but also the horrific American bombing raids that were meant to subdue them. There is fresh wreckage, though a guide is needed to locate it. Kabul was already a violated city.

In the early 1990's, the warlords used it as a battleground, their artillery swallowing entire neighborhoods that came to look like ancient ruins. The newer rubble from American air attacks blends seamlessly into the archaeology of the old.

Indeed, the essential look of the mountain-ringed city remains the same. Cars still maneuver around the pushcarts and donkey-led wagons. Withered old men carry bundles of firewood strapped to their shoulders. Shrouded women move through the bazaars like downtrodden ghosts. Children use the remnants of collapsed buildings as playgrounds.

Only with a second look come the sights that would have been unthinkable a month ago. Over there, some men are clean-shaven, the hat of the Northern Alliance substituting for the turbans preferred by the Taliban. Over here are a few courageous women, walking outdoors without the head-to-toe burka.

""For adult women like me, our houses had become our prisons because the Taliban said we could not go outside unaccompanied by a male relative,"" said Shahnaz Rasuol, 27, who on Wednesday applied for the medical college of Kabul University. She smiled, fingering the necklace that adorned her gold sweater. ""We were barely alive.""

But while some people's lives flood with change, the transformation for most others is barely a trickle. In this male-dominated society, families restricted the freedoms of their women long before the Taliban appeared. Only a very few of Kabul's women have shed the shrouds. Even Ms. Rasuol, seated in the university registrar's office, wore the required burka, though the front was pulled back around her forehead until the garment looked like the long, flowing habit of a nun. Before going outdoors, she covered herself completely.

""Women are still afraid,"" she said. ""The Taliban are gone, yes, but our own community also enforces the burka.""

Poverty also restricts. Kabul's population of 1.5 million is overwhelmingly destitute. Nearly half of its citizens are nourished from bread lines.

There may be a frenzied scene on Nadir Pashtun Street, with people -- long denied television -- carrying newly purchased sets out of the electronics stores. Aziz Ahmad, the young owner of one store, is selling 10 to 15 TV's a day. ""Yes, I will be rich,"" he said cheerily. But Mr. Ahmad's customers, in their leather jackets and clean sneakers, are not the common folk. Most homes not only lack television, they also want for electricity and water.

And it may be nice that Mahbooba, a hairdresser, no longer has to run her beauty shop clandestinely, with those cans of German hair spray on the narrow shelves of her small apartment and the lipstick lined up like spices on a rack. But her clientele comes from the few who can afford $3.50 for a stylish haircut.

""Hats are now the fashion instead of turbans,"" observed Muhammad Asil, a vendor of vegetables. His beard was still long and scruffy. He still wears a turban. ""I have no money to change what I put on my head.""

Mr. Asil's tiny shop is on Butchery Street, where the meat cutters still skin whole cows at curbside. Last week, no one there was willing to offer a kind word for the Taliban. Instead, they showed off scars from beatings or told of time spent in jail because their beards were too short or mustaches too long. ""These were crazy people,"" said Nisar Ahmad, trying to pre-empt any further discussion of the matter as he tossed a severed hoof into a metal pail.

Kabul, a city that the travel guides once considered cosmopolitan, was deemed a place of special wickedness by the Taliban. The thuggish zealots of the Department for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice patrolled the capital in their greatest numbers, sweeping through the streets in their Toyota pickups, stopping to give transgressors a taste of the whip.

Dr. Tabibzada, the surgeon, was once throttled for being outdoors during the time for prayer. The use of cosmetics also got her into trouble, once for lipstick, another time for nail polish. In deference to her position, her punishment was merely to be sent home.

Muhammad Naim, the owner of a photo studio, was imprisoned for 50 days. Passport-size snapshots were permissible, but he took a risk, taking a picture of a family that posed in his shop before the make-believe backdrop of a flowery meadow.

""While some Taliban locked me up, others wanted their pictures taken, holding their guns,"" Mr. Naim said. He pulled photographic proof from a drawer. ""Here they are.""

Welcomed into Kabul in 1996 as a pious remedy to crippling lawlessness, the Taliban gradually squandered the good will. The virtue-and-vice disciplinarians presented the movement's ugly face.

When people here rail against the Taliban, they most often mean the bullying religious police. There were two branches, one for the public, another for the military. They were despised by virtually everyone, including the Taliban rank and file.

At the top, the Taliban were led by Mullah Muhammad Omar, a mystic with a tendency to trust his prophetic dreams and persuasive Arabs. The bottom was diffuse. There were no card-carrying members of the Taliban. The average adherent kept a low flame under his zeal. Many soldiers were conscripts, sent to the front lines by their families in lieu of paying a tax.

The aggressiveness of the religious police varied over time. Last summer found it in a high gear of stubborn vigilance, part of the same quarrelsome lurch that had the Taliban destroying Buddhist statues and putting eight foreign aid workers -- two Americans, two Australians and four Germans -- on trial for the crime of trying to convert Muslims to Christianity. It was considered a capital offense.

A contingent of the international news media came to Kabul to cover the proceedings, which were difficult to observe. Under the Taliban, executions were usually open to the public but trials were not. Finally, an exception was made. Reporters crowded into the chambers of Mullah Noor Muhammad Saqib, chief justice of the Supreme Court. A young man with a black fluffy beard, he sat before a framed prayer mat, two long swords and a strap used for whippings.

He was devoted to Islamic jurisprudence, he said. He promised a fair trial, despite having proclaimed the accused guilty in a sermon at the city's biggest mosque. ""Under the cover of humanitarian assistance, they offer bread to our poor people and then ask them to convert to a religion that was canceled out by the advent of Islam,"" he said.

The trial was still in progress on Sept. 11, when the world's attention veered elsewhere. The eight Christians eventually escaped during the Taliban's retreat.

Today, the courtroom is occupied by Maulvi Fazil Wahab, a chief justice appointed by the Northern Alliance. He also claims devotion to Islamic law. The swords and whip remain. He, too, believes that under certain circumstances, trying to convert a Muslim to Christianity is a crime punishable by death. ""It would depend on the facts but this is a grave, grave matter,"" he said.

The various halls of government all have new men in charge. Little is known of what happened to their predecessors. Some of these erstwhile ministers were sincerely devoted to their work, though few had qualifications beyond their rigorous study of Islam and the rote memorization of the entire Koran. They were better ideologues than bureaucrats.

The Taliban's chief of statistics knew nothing of numbers; one education minister wishfully longed for all young men to be killed during jihad and spend eternity in paradise. The chief of Wazir Akhbar Khan public hospital was a mullah who knew nothing of medicine; so was the director of nursing.

""The Taliban were not from the masses,"" said Sabir Latifi, the businessman who saved the paintings. ""They were like a raft on the river. They had no roots.""

Mr. Latifi was able to get along with some of them. Self-righteous as most were, some understood the global body language of the greased palm. When it came to rescuing the 50 condemned artworks, the businessman dealt with ""a big Taliban, very high up.""

The two men haggled, Mr. Latifi said. There were portraits of naked women involved, which raised both the amount of the risk and level of the transgression.

""I started at $1,000,"" the businessman said, recalling the negotiation. He seemed to respect the shrewdness of the ""big Taliban."" Not all were honest, but each was obstinate.

""It took $5,000 to do the deal."""
80,NYT,Barry Bearak,2002,Afghanistan War,"The giant Buddhas perished in this storied valley. For 1,500 years, the two statues stood in their sandstone niches and stared across the rugged plain toward the snowy peaks of the Baba mountains. The Taliban destroyed them last spring, making precise incisions to strategically place the explosives.

But the Buddhas were only the best known and most visible of the Taliban's victims in this remote region of central Afghanistan. Within months, other terrible crimes were committed here. Ethnic hatred was the grisly wellspring for methodical murder and devastation.

For three and a half years, the Taliban have restricted entry into this battlefield. Only in recent days have outsiders traveled the mine- bedeviled roads to survey the havoc. What they see is scorched earth. Little is left of the hamlets on the heaving single lane west of Bamian except ashes and mud. Decomposed bodies are still being found on the frozen soil.

Squads of mainly Pashtun Taliban marauders went from village to village and house to house, gutting the dwellings of the Mongol-featured Hazaras, their main adversary in these narrow gorges and vaulting peaks, chasing them from even the meager livelihoods of their infertile land.

Now, with the Taliban gone, desperate Hazaras are slowly returning to mountainside homes in places like Shahidan, Shebertoo, Qarghanatoo, Aghrabat and Gulestan. Most often, they discover only the charred shell of a ransacked house. There are no roofs above their heads, no wheat or barley in their bins. Last week, as the season's first snowflakes were whipped by the wind, some wondered whether hunger or cold would be first to claim their children.

""Look at my boy, he has nothing on his bones,"" said Abdul Hussain, holding a feverish 2-year-old in his arms in Shebertoo. The child, wearing a sweater and vest but no shoes, was making faint, pitiful sounds: eh, eh. His legs were as thin as saplings. ""He becomes weaker every day,"" the father said. ""Maybe I have brought him home to die.""

Soon the snow will block the roads, already difficult with axle-jarring ruts. Relief agencies, long endangered by war, have yet to fully mobilize. A few weeks ago, American bombers hit a Bamian-bound 22- truck convoy of the World Food Program, destroying 6 of the vehicles, witnesses said. The city's main hospital has just now reopened. There is one doctor and no medicine. The retreating Taliban stole the beds, the generator and the X-ray machine.

""So many are suffering from pneumonia and grippe and depression,"" said Dr. Ali Khan Sharifi, standing beside a dusty examination table. ""People have no possessions, no pillows, no mattresses, no house, no wheat to harvest. This is why they are depressed.""

As the Taliban retreat, disappearing abruptly after five years in power, the full weight of the devastation they wrought becomes apparent. Bamian and the places nearby are a shocking example.

The road west is as hard to traverse as it is spectacular to behold. The mammoth walls of brown rock seem partially molded by man, like giant sand castles once washed by the sea. Some are honeycombed like sponges. Some are sheared flat at the top. One has a great fissure made white by an icy spring that is said to be the frozen tears of a dragon.

As last Monday unscrolled its morning light, a man and his mule came around a bend. His name was Abdul Hamid, and by necessity his turban was partly unfurled so it could contest the wind as a mask and a scarf.

Two days ago, he had come back to his home in Shahidan. The Taliban vandals -- specially trained for arson and demolition -- had worked efficiently. The beams of his house had been eaten by fire. The roof now lay on the floor.

Still, he was a fortunate man. In June, as the Taliban approached, he had fled. Some others had not. ""Let me tell you about Ghulam Sangzawar,"" Mr. Hamid said. ""He stayed behind. He said he could live with the Taliban but on the second day they slit his throat.""

A death toll is impossible to tally. It is early in the counting and people are dispersed, some gone to safety, others to eternity. But anecdotes accumulate -- stories of men slaughtered while hung upside down or bound with rope or piled in a heap like logs.

Muhammad Hussain returned to a nearly deserted Shebertoo 10 days ago. He surmised that many of his neighbors had been killed, though he only happened upon six bodies.

""What was left of them had rotted,"" he said, staring out at fallow barley fields. ""We couldn't haul them to our cemetery. We buried them where they were without proper prayers.""

Mr. Hussain, a village elder, appointed himself as guide, leading the way up a steep incline toward mud houses built on patches of flatness. He is a stocky man with a white beard made dingy by dust. His chief defense against the cold was a thin corduroy coat.

He stopped at a well. ""This one is useless to us,"" he said gravely. ""It smells bad, and we think the Taliban put chemicals in it. Something dreadful is down there.""

Then there are the houses, ruin after ruin. Such destruction required skill. Mud walls blacken but do not burn. Nourished on wood, the fire had to follow a hopscotch path to consume both roofs and window frames. Long months later, the air is still acrid.

Mr. Hussain and his family escaped by suffering a three-day trudge through the mountains. They slept in the stables of a distant village. Upon their return, fearing the worst, they were surprised by the good fortune of an intact roof. Five families now huddle in two rooms, burning yellow-brown scrub for heat.

""You will not find a better place in Shebertoo,"" the man boasted.

Nearby was another livable space, with one room sheltered by a wood roof and a second one feebly protected with burlap. But this was a house full of sickness. Fatima, an old woman with swollen lips, emerged from the darkness, walking stooped over like a comma.

A lament substituted for a greeting. ""I am dying,"" were her first words, accompanied by a rasp well- burrowed in her chest. ""Do you have medicine?""

Her distress was shared. Bunched in a dank corner of a small room were two other women and five children. A thin line of light was arriving through a tiny window covered by plastic. The weak coughs of the youngsters interrupted the silence. ""We have only tea and barley bread to eat and little of that,"" Fatima said.

She pointed to her best exhibit of affliction. Gulbakht, 25, seemed petrified in one position, her hands grasping her ankles. She did not move or speak. There was a blankness to her face as if she was already far along on the journey to her own demise. ""She has no milk to feed this little baby,"" Fatima said, cradling a wiggly bundle in her arms. ""She has been this way for a month. We had to bring Gulbakht here on a donkey.""

Muhammad Hussain, the elder, had been listening. To him, this seemed a good time to curse the Taliban. ""They want all the Hazaras to die,"" he said. ""They are very bad people.""

In the end, the Taliban turned out to be not just religious zealots but relentless conquerors. To complete their domination of the country they had to go where they were exceedingly unwelcome. The lairs of the Hazaras were such places.

History had provided the Taliban with precedent. One hundred years ago, the Pashtun emir Abdul Rahman made the massacre of Hazaras a central element of his autocratic rule. He was not only offended by their independence but also by their religion. The emir was a Sunni Muslim while the Hazaras were Shiites. He labeled them infidels.

Most of the Taliban are also Sunnis, and some of their leaders have similarly condemned the Hazaras. In 1998, during the conquest of Mazar-i- Sharif, the Taliban-appointed governor converted his religious prejudices into an ungodly massacre.

Thousands of Hazaras were murdered, often in ghastly fashion, their bodies then treated with additional contempt. Hundreds more were crammed into shipping containers that were placed in the sun to bake. Nearly all suffocated. To some Pashtuns, the killing was a fitting reply to a previous massacre in which the role of villain was reversed. Hazaras have committed their own atrocities. Some have nailed spikes through their enemies. Others have used beheadings as entertainment.

""Hazaras cannot pretend to be innocent,"" said one Pashtun who has worked in Bamian.

As with much of Afghanistan's political jigsaw, the pieces rarely fit neatly. There is a temptation to cite last summer's rampages -- as well as earlier ones in the town of Yakaolang and elsewhere -- as classic instances of ""ethnic cleansing."" But while the Taliban were murdering Hazaras in one place, they were accommodating them in others. One Hazara warlord, his chameleon colors on full display, remained a Taliban ally to the last.

The Taliban's scorched-earth tactics also served a military purpose. Their forces had superior weaponry but the Hazaras had popular support. ""When we needed to, we could supply ourselves in Shahidan and other places,"" said Hajji Ali Yar, the Hazara commander in Bamian. ""Without them, everything was harder. This was one reason the Taliban burned the villages.""

Bamian, the provincial capital, changed hands repeatedly. The Taliban first captured it in September 1998, then were dislodged for three weeks in 1999. They lost the city again for three days earlier this year and were finally routed on Nov. 11.

""Look at Bamian now,"" said Sayed Muhammad Hussain Hashimi, a farmer whose family has fled from place to place since the Taliban raided his village. ""War has left people with barely a space to live in, barely a building that has not come under the torch.""

Ten days ago, Mr. Hashimi moved his family to somewhere fireproof. They now live in one of the grottoes that freckle the colossal sandstone cliff where the Buddhas stood. Many refugees from the ravaged villages live there. They are the mountain's new mendicants.

Centuries ago, these hundreds of caves were monastic cells. Bamian was a vital stop for camel caravans along the ancient Silk Route between China and Rome. Buddhism, once flourishing here, had given way to Islam. But ascetics still came here to ponder the ineluctable burden of human suffering and the Buddha's middle path to truth.

The smaller Buddha, 120 feet, was the first to fall. The bigger one, at 175 feet, required a greater injection of explosives. Men with chisels were then lowered by rope to chip away at bulging remnants.

Now, the surrounding niches look like molested keyholes. Only an imprint of the Buddha remains as if preserved in a fossil. Some of the bigger chunks rest in a heap, mingled with rubbish. The Taliban carted off smaller fragments in their pickups.

There was more, of course. The blasting sprayed the air with billions of granules. Those are now dust, freed by the wind and mixed into the soil.

The statues had been springboards of awe. They survived attacks from Genghis Khan and other Mongol conquerors. Their destruction belongs instead to men who found the portrayal of the human form an impiety. Hundreds of years from now this may be the single footnote the Taliban have carried into the annals of time."
81,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"Teofilo Gonzalez Cano stabbed his cousin to death with two quick jabs to the heart.

They had been the best of friends, growing up together in the same mud-brick house in this tiny village in southern Mexico. But one night they drank themselves nearly blind on homemade grain alcohol. An argument about nothing got out of hand, and soon Vicente Gonzalez Santiago lay dead in the dirt.

Teofilo ran. They found him at dawn, sitting in a forest clutching his empty bottle. The local farmer who served as village constable, another cousin of Teofilo's, bound his hands behind his back and brought him in.

The whole village was waiting, more than 300 people. They forced Teofilo to lie facedown next to Vicente's corpse. They shouted at him, called him a murderer. His mother sat in the dirt next to her son, pleading for mercy.

The nearest police were more than two hours' drive away and there was no telephone in Dos Rios, hidden in rugged mountains 180 miles southwest of Mexico City. Justice in this backwater belongs to a half-dozen town elders, who stood over the two cousins in their early thirties, one dead and one accused, and debated the punishment that day in 1999. Finally they agreed.

""They said the two of them should be buried together,"" said Catarina Cano Santiago, Teofilo's mother.

According to Cano, other Dos Rios residents and human rights investigators, the elders enlisted villagers to carry out the sentence. Some of the men hacked a grave in the rocky soil of the village cemetery. Someone banged together a flimsy wooden coffin, and the villagers put Vicente's body in it. They hoisted the box and began a procession down a narrow cow path to the graveyard. Others dragged Teofilo by the arms. Women and children followed, marching under a hot sun past fields of dead corn.

They placed Vicente's coffin in the hole, then threw Teofilo in on top, with his arms and legs tied together. He screamed and begged for his life, calling out to his mother, ""Please don't let them do this to me!"" She tried to help him, but her neighbors and friends held her back. The law had spoken, and no one would stand in its way.

Twenty men started throwing dirt into the hole with shovels and sticks. Teofilo, screaming, tried to climb out. His 14-year-old son, Felipe, ran to him and tried to hug him and pull him up. Someone tossed a lasso around Teofilo's neck and jerked him back into the grave, ripping him from his boy's embrace. They pulled the crying youth away from his father as the dirt piled higher and higher on top of him, until he disappeared into the ground.

""When they finished,"" said his mother, ""you could still hear him screaming under the ground.""

Challenge of Modernization
Dos Rios is a dusty wisp of a village clinging to a mountainside in Guerrero state. It takes 12 hours to drive there from the capital, down a road that turns from pavement to dirt to a harrowing path that drops thousands of feet on either side.

Fewer than 400 people live in Dos Rios, in a cluster of soft-brick huts baked by a close, heavy sun. There is no electricity, not a light bulb in town. The only vehicle is an old Ford pickup truck. A priest comes once a year to say Mass in the crumbling Roman Catholic church. It has been months since a police patrol passed through.

As Mexico seeks to modernize, setting up a formal justice system in places like this is one of its most difficult challenges.

Mexico has more than 148,000 communities with fewer than 100 residents, many of them isolated in the vast stretches of mountains and deserts that cover much of this country. By comparison, the United States, which has five times more land area, has fewer than 2,000 towns with populations under 100.

More than 25 million Mexicans -- a quarter of the population -- live in communities of 2,500 people or fewer. Government officials say it is simply too expensive to run roads and electric lines to many of them, let alone provide police, prosecutors and judges. As a result, millions of Mexicans live in places that remain largely beyond the law.

""The rule of law is absent in these towns. The level of impunity is extremely high,"" said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, Mexico's new ambassador to the United Nations, who served until recently as national security adviser.

He said the administration of President Vicente Fox is working to equip rural police with satellite communication systems and create more uniform police coverage around the country. But he said many state and local government officials have resisted that idea because they still operate under the practices that dominated during seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. For years, he said, the PRI encouraged powerful local bosses to handle justice in their own way.

Abel Barrera, a human rights activist based in Tlapa, near Dos Rios, called justice in Mexico ""unbalanced.""

""Things have changed in the cities, but in parts of the country like this, here in the countryside, violence is still the accepted mechanism of justice,"" said Barrera, who investigated the Teofilo Gonzalez Cano case. ""It's still the law of the jungle.""

There is no formal accounting of how many people are killed in Mexico's rough rural justice every year. But human rights groups estimate that hundreds have been killed and hundreds more beaten over the years in punishments meted out beyond official scrutiny. Barrera said at least 10 people a year are killed in the region around Dos Rios in a form of local justice.

""People here have not yet taken notice that Mexico is changing,"" Barrera said.

Equal protection under the law does not exist. Sentences are given out on the judgment of a few men, who often have little education and no legal training. Their decisions are effectively beyond the oversight of federal, state and municipal governments.

In some cases, their punishment is far more harsh than the formal legal system requires. For example, Mexico has no death penalty or life sentences, but the Dos Rios villagers buried Teofilo alive.

In other cases, local elders are far more lenient than judges. Town elders in Dos Rios said they would punish a rapist with ""a few hours"" in the town's small jail cell, plus a restitution payment of perhaps $100 to the victim's family. They recalled one case in which the rapist was forced to pay for a party that the victim's family was planning.

Dos Rios is a Mixtec Indian community, governed by traditional practices. Mexico has long debated how far to go in allowing its 10 million Indians to run their own judicial systems. Critics argue that all Mexicans should be governed by the same legal system. But Dos Rios remains one of many places -- Indian and non-Indian -- set apart from mainstream justice in Mexico.

With each passing decade, roads and other public services creep closer to these self-ruled villages. Ten years ago, the road into Dos Rios was little more than a donkey path used largely by farmers hauling their opium poppies to market. Today, trucks hauling beer and Pepsi lumber down the roads, supplying villages with the syrupy smack of globalization.

But the rule of law cannot be loaded onto a delivery truck, and the protection of police and courts still barely exists.

""We can't get everywhere,"" said Isidro Basurto Mendoz, the official in charge of police in Metlatonoc, the municipal seat, which is three hours from Dos Rios by car and 10 on foot. ""The distances are too great, and we have no communications. The problem is that when we can't get there, people take justice into their own hands.""

Basurto said he has 18 police officers and one pickup truck to cover 30,000 people in 156 small communities spread over an area about the size of Montgomery County. Most are reachable only by four-wheel-drive vehicles. In the rainy season they are cut off by impassable roads.

As Basurto spoke, word filtered in that two men had been killed the night before in a village a couple of hours' drive into the mountains. A dozen of Basurto's officers grabbed their shotguns and hopped into the back of the police pickup. Despite the display of firepower, Basurto said he and his men would almost certainly not solve the crime.

""I'm going to get the information, give the bodies to the families for burial, then I'll come back to do the paperwork,"" he said.

Basurto said it was unlikely that any suspect would ever be convicted. He said his officers are not trained to gather or handle evidence. Witnesses would need to drive for hours or walk for days to give testimony before a judge. He said people have no money to make such a trip, and would fear retaliation.

Two suspects were recently arrested and charged with murder in a nearby village. Basurto turned them over to regional prosecutors, but they were free within three months. He suspects they paid a bribe to get the charges dropped. Now, he said, they are back in their village, threatening to kill those who identified them.

Basurto said that case is unusual because the suspects were charged and turned over to prosecutors. ""Usually by the time we find out about a case, it's already been resolved,"" he said. ""Or we don't find out about it at all.""

Growing Up Together
Teofilo and Vicente grew up the way all children do here: poorly nourished, without shoes and with little knowledge of the outside world. They played among the chickens and mango trees, and they were lucky to survive. Elders here say that until a state government doctor began making regular visits a few years ago, many children died for lack of medicine and basic care.

The two boys were reared in one of the village's small red-brown cubes of mud. Together, working the fields of corn and beans, they grew into men. There are no known photos of either cousin in this village, where cameras are rare. Their families describe them as typical in every way, two sturdy farmhands.

They both married and had the same kind of families: three sons and a daughter. Then things went sour for Teofilo. His wife died in childbirth. He remarried, but his second wife died of a fever about five years ago. He was raising his children alone.

Vicente was building his own house, next to a shady grove of banana trees where he was raised. His uncle lived there, too. It was in his house that Vicente and Teofilo started drinking one afternoon in March 1999. They drank all night. Some here say that Vicente began making jokes about Teofilo's two dead wives. All that is known for sure is that sometime after midnight, Teofilo pulled out a small knife and stabbed Vicente twice in the chest.

By 8 a.m. Teofilo had been brought in and the two men lay side by side on the dirt floor of Vicente's house, with the six elders standing over them, discussing their fate. Vicente's brother, who declined to give his name in an effort to avoid drawing more attention to the case, said the elders made the decision to bury Teofilo alive.

The town elders also wish to avoid attention. Asked about the case one recent morning, Juan Gonzalez Ruiz, the comisario, or head of the local government, switched out of Spanish and consulted with the five other elders, all men in their forties and fifties sitting outside the village hall. They debated for 20 minutes in their Indian language. According to a local schoolteacher who speaks both languages, Gonzalez wanted to tell the truth but the elders instructed him to lie. They said they did not want any more trouble.

Following their orders, Gonzalez told a reporter that Vicente had died in an accident and that Teofilo had run away. The elders nodded in agreement.

The comisario is elected by village residents, and the elders are former comisarios. They said their main goal was to find negotiated solutions to crimes and disputes. They have 10 unpaid ""community police"" officers, whose duties include helping to keep the peace at festivals and tracking down stolen animals.

Justice varies greatly by community. In some villages, stealing an animal has led to hanging. But here, Gonzalez said, the penalty for stealing a cow is a few hours in jail. He said he or the elders go to the cell and ask the thief why he stole. They try to impress on him that stealing is bad.

Education is sorely lacking. Sixty-seven children study in the village school, which goes to the sixth grade. Only a few children finish all six years. If they wanted to continue their schooling, they would have to drive three hours to Metlatonoc. No one can remember anyone ever doing that.

The people are accustomed to accepting the punishments meted out by the elders. But Teofilo's case shocked many residents. Guadalupe Martinez Castillo, who said she is about 40, said she still cannot believe what her town did.

""It frightens me because I think the same could happen to me, my children, my family,"" she said. ""Everyone lives in fear because they didn't do that to an animal, they killed a person.""

Cano, Teofilo's mother, said she lives with fear and regret. From her home, she can just about see the village's hilltop cemetery, where the two cousins are buried in a grave marked by a single anonymous slab of wood jammed into the rocky ground.

Sitting in the red dirt at her house, Cano said she wished she had filed some kind of complaint about her son's death. But she is afraid to challenge the men who run Dos Rios.

""I don't have the courage to confront them,"" she said. ""If I were a man, it might be different. But people here don't know who to go to for justice.""

Francisco Estrada Rojas, who teaches at the elementary school, said the elders ordered Teofilo to be buried alive to ""teach a big lesson.""

He said there had been several murders in Dos Rios in the years leading up to Teofilo's execution. He said that, in the absence of police, disputes over land, family matters, a few cattle or other minor issues often ended in bloodshed. He said few of those killers were caught, and when they were, they almost always seemed to be able to bribe police or prosecutors to let them off.

""That's why people take justice into their own hands,"" Estrada said. ""This happened because the community had been beaten down by so many crimes without punishment.""

Estrada said that when the police arrived a day after the murders, they wanted to dig up the men to see for themselves what had happened, and to put the two men in separate graves. But local officials told the police that no one in town would help them. Estrada said they told the police: ""You'll have to pay for the food and drink of the laborers, and no one wants to do that kind of work.""

Several people in the community said the police stayed only a few minutes longer. There is a widespread belief here that the officers were paid a bribe to forget about the whole thing.

""They didn't arrest anybody,"" Estrada said. ""Because they would have had to arrest the whole community."""
82,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"The cop looked Jimmy Salguero in the eyes and asked the question that would change his life.

""What's your name?"" he said.

""Jimmy Salguero,"" said Jimmy Salguero.

The officer clicked a few keys on his computer keyboard.

""No, you're Jaime Garcia,"" he said.

""No I'm not,"" he insisted.

But it was no use. It was a Friday night, and the police would look good ending the week with a prize arrest. So a Guatemalan painter named Jimmy Salguero became Tijuana robber Jaime Garcia.

Telling the story later, Salguero, 32, said that he had been just another face in Tijuana, living in a Salvation Army shelter and trying to scheme his way across the border into the United States.

To pick up some cash, he had taken a job painting apartments. As he left work that evening in May 2000, the police stopped him and four Mexican painters and asked for their identification. The others produced ID cards. Salguero had none.

The officers whispered among themselves, then hauled him to the station, gave him a new name and sent him to La Mesa, one of the most notorious prisons in Latin America.

When Salguero protested, the cops punched him. They told him to shut up.

Behind bars, month after month, everyone called him Jaime.

Learning the Hard Way
The presumption of innocence and the right to see an attorney have long been written into Mexican law. But in practice those protections are often available only to those who can afford them.

President Vicente Fox, who took office nearly 16 months ago promising to spread democratic protections to all, has sought to end government abuse of individuals, and in particular to end a tradition of arbitrary, sloppy and corrupt police practices.

But injustice has deep roots in Mexico's justice system. There are still two legal systems in the country: one for those with money and connections, and one for the poor.

Salguero said he saw that up close on the ride to the police station, when one of the officers offered him the opportunity to buy his way out of trouble.

""I hear it costs about $1,500 to $2,000 to cross the border,"" the officer said slyly, Salguero recalled, referring to the going rate for a smuggler to guide immigrants into the United States. Salguero said he understood the deal being offered: Turn over your travel money and you can go home. But he had no cash.

""I just asked, 'How long will I be in this place?' "" Salguero said. When the police officers realized they were squeezing an empty wallet, they turned cold. ""They told me, 'It will be one to three months before the judge sees you.' ""

As an undocumented migrant, Salguero was particularly vulnerable to police abuse. But he figured one person could surely help him: his older sister Ericka, a successful office clerk who lives in Rockville, Md.

He placed a collect phone call from the station. To his relief, she answered. He was certain that his sister, an 18-year resident of the United States with legal status there, could convince the Tijuana police that he was Guatemalan.

Salguero handed the phone to the officer on duty. ""Please talk to my sister,"" he said.

The officer grabbed the phone and hung up.

""The line just cut off,"" his sister recalled. ""They just didn't care who he was.""

Still, she figured the police would correct their mistake: ""You take someone's fingerprints and you find out who he is, or who he is not. How hard is that?""

But everything got harder.

'You Pay for Everything'
At first, Salguero didn't have a bed in prison. He needed cash for that. In La Mesa, as in many Mexican prisons, inmates pay for their accommodations. How well you sleep, eat and live depends on how much money you have. The divide between rich and poor so prevalent in Latin America is exaggerated inside that giant cage.

The night Salguero arrived in the spring of 2000, he was broke. In La Mesa, penniless can mean homeless. Night after night, he joined other poor inmates searching for a patch of hard ground on the basketball court. ""There was no mattress, but somehow I got a blanket,"" Salguero said.

He soon learned that the thin blanket was one of the rare comforts provided free of charge. Even visiting rights and toilet paper would cost him.

From his concrete bed, Salguero could see the prison's version of luxury. The central section of the prison was filled with more than 400 small wooden houses, many with windows, balconies and stereos. The richer inmates live there.

The warden, Carlos Lugo Felix, said it was his understanding that the top price for one of the little houses was $1,500. But inmates and human rights advocates, including Cesar Barros Leal, a Brazilian law professor who visited La Mesa in December, said the black market price is as high as $30,000 for the finest homes. Middle-class prisoners sleep in relatively uncrowded cells, sharing one with perhaps six others. And the poorest sleep on the ground, Barros said.

Prison officials, trying to squeeze 5,500 inmates into a space built with a tiny budget for 2,800, allowed prisoners to build their own tiny houses years ago. Officials also allowed inmates to open kiosks, where they sell shrimp cocktails, hamburgers, tacos and burritos, and even rent videos. Inmates without cash do without.

Family is a kind of wealth here, too. By long-established custom in Mexico, prisons do not provide all of an inmate's food and supplies. An inmate's family is expected to make frequent visits and provide milk, meat, shampoo, jeans, shirts and medicine -- or the money to buy them.

Five days a week, Salguero watched a parade of more than 2,000 visitors enter La Mesa, lugging bags of supplies. Some men around him ate as well as they would at home, with enchiladas one day and fried chicken the next. But Salguero, with no family in Mexico, survived mainly on the gruel that was wheeled around the prison in vats.

All around him, families spent nights together: More than 500 wives and several hundred children spend at least a few nights a week inside the prison. But nobody visited Salguero, and no one threw anything over the wall for him at night in what is known as the ""rain of objects.""

With the guards paid off to look the other way, family members and friends tossed packages over the prison wall, often at times and places arranged on smuggled cell phones. Even cocaine and heroin stuffed inside soccer balls were thrown over the wall.

Salguero's thoughts were consumed by earning money. He needed to eat and to bribe guards. So he worked for other inmates who ran shoeshining and laundry businesses. And he carved wooden ships and picture frames and sold them to inmates and visitors.

""You pay for everything, even for water,"" he said. ""To not have money in prison is like being out on the street without anything, with nothing to wear, no way to bathe yourself.""

Inmates have even divided the territory inside the prison and set up what amounts to a system of tollbooths. When Salguero wanted to use a pay phone, he paid a gatekeeper about five cents in pesos. When he wanted to go into the visitors' area to try to talk to someone else's attorney, he forked over 20 cents.

What really drained his finances was the roll-call bribe. Every night, when the prisoners lined up to be counted, Salguero had to slip a guard 50 cents to be marked present on the attendance sheet. The days inmates spend in prison are recorded only when they are marked present; missing roll call means spending more time in prison. Guards have turned that into a big moneymaker. With more than 5,000 inmates in La Mesa, the total take from the shakedown could reach $2,500 or more a day.

Salguero paid his 50 cents nearly every night. Each time he did, Jaime Garcia got credit for another day in prison. Garcia, a convicted robber, was being sought for violating parole when Salguero was arrested. Now Salguero was serving out the remainder of Garcia's five-year term.

The injustice tore at him.

""I kept saying 'I want to see a judge or a lawyer,' "" he said. ""But nobody paid any attention to me.""

""Other guys in jail said to me, 'Welcome to Mexico. That's how justice is.' ""

'Invisible' Inmates
Salguero was not the only inmate serving time unjustly in Mexico. Human rights advocates and Mexican law enforcement officials said there have been many cases in which the wrong person has served time. Record-keeping has been so sloppy in prisons that officials have not even known the actual identities of inmates, or how many there are. Most prisons lack computerized databases of criminals' fingerprints or mug shots.

Some inmates who cannot afford a lawyer have been kept in prison beyond their sentences. And fugitives wanted for serious crimes have been discovered in prison serving time for petty offenses under assumed names.

A spokesman for the state police in Tijuana said he was unaware of Salguero's case and could not comment on it. Lugo, the warden, said that since he took over four months ago, he has established new procedures for registering and tracking inmates.

Salguero, a quiet, serious man, became withdrawn as time passed. On good days he dreamed of getting out and going back to school to learn automobile engineering. He wanted to build cars in the United States. He had only finished primary school in Puerto Barrios, his home town in Guatemala, 2,600 miles southeast of here.

He joined a Bible study group. His new friends got him off the ground and into a bunk. They paid for his new quarters and later, when he had money, they charged him a small fee each week. But they offered no hope.

""Even my brothers in the Christian group told me, 'You will be here for a long time.' I asked their visitors to help me but they didn't. Maybe they were scared or maybe they thought I was lying. Even a pastor told me I was paying for some debt I probably owed.""

Christmas 2000 came and went.

""In my solitude, I would read the Bible,"" he said. ""It was the only thing that consoled me. I felt invisible.""

Dispatching Help
In Rockville, Ericka Salguero was frantic. With three small children, a new mortgage and a demanding job, she couldn't afford the 2,800-mile trip to Tijuana. Her pleas for help from the Guatemalan embassies in the United States and Mexico went nowhere. She arranged for a relative in Los Angeles to take the three-hour bus trip across the border to give Salguero money and new clothes. She was worried because when she had last spoken to her brother he had said: ""Send money so I won't get beaten.""

Ericka's mother-in-law arrived at La Mesa and waited nervously in the long visitors' line. The sight of police in bulletproof vests on the roof made her jittery; the smell of sewage and the picture of too many people behind chain-link fences made her sad.

When she finally arrived at the visitors' window, she asked to see Salguero -- using the name Jaime Garcia. She didn't know it, but she had just fallen into another moneymaking racket. The inmates who control the visitors' area charge a fee to find the inmate being summoned. And often, they charge the inmates for the ""privilege"" of seeing their visitors.

She didn't know that she was supposed to pay. Salguero never appeared. The inmates persuaded her to leave the package of clothes and money with them; they said they would deliver it. But Salguero said he never received the package or a message that a visitor had come.

""I wanted to scream. I wanted to say, 'I am not this person,' "" he said. But complaints earned him a beating or, from the gentler guards, these words: ""Then prove it.""

Salguero couldn't. So he carved boats. When he had the extra pesos, he paid to get into the visitors' area to beg a few words with other inmates' visitors and attorneys. No one took him seriously.

Finally, one visitor gave him what turned out to be a golden brushoff. If you think you have a real gripe, call the human rights office in Tijuana, he said. The man passed him the phone number.

Salguero was excited about the new lead, but he needed $3 for a phone card to pursue it. He worked and saved, ate less, and finally bought a shiny new phone card.

It had been more than a year since his arrest.

He slipped the card into a phone, dialed the number, and Luis Hernandez picked up.

Finding a Way Out
Hernandez, a 22-year-old lawyer, had been working in the human rights office for four months. He was fielding five or six calls a day from prisoners in La Mesa, all with horror stories. On May 25, 2001, he visited Salguero. After they talked, Hernandez went to the court to see the file of Jaime Garcia.

""I was stunned,"" he said.

The man in the photo in Garcia's file was obviously not Salguero. He was older, taller and fatter. He had dark skin and curly hair, not the fair skin and straight hair of the man Hernandez had just visited. And he had drug needle marks running up and down his arms; Salguero did not.

Hernandez wrote to the judge in Garcia's case.

On June 5, as Jimmy Salguero neared the end of his 13th month in prison, he was summoned to the office of the deputy prison director.

""Are you Jaime Garcia?"" the man asked.

""That is what they call me here. My real name is Jimmy Salguero. I am not Mexican.""

The official, who, along with other top management has since left the prison, was quiet. He told him to wait. An hour later he returned and said only this: ""I have good news. You are free to leave.""

In minutes Salguero was on the street.

He raced to find Hernandez.

""Jimmy walked in and was in disbelief. His face was blank. No one told him why they released him,"" said the lawyer, reached in Spain, where he is now studying for a doctorate in human rights. He said he believed Salguero should sue the Tijuana police.

Ericka Salguero said he should receive an apology, at least. ""They stole a year of his life, and it is not good enough to say, 'Bye, bye,' as if nothing happened,"" she said.

But Salguero's thoughts are already in Canada. They make cars there, too, and since Sept. 11, it's easier to go there than to the United States. He spends his days painting cars in Tijuana, saving his money."
83,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"Alfonso Martin del Campo Dodd stood naked in the basement of a Mexico City police station, where he said cops took turns punching him and slapping him, kicking him in the groin and screaming at him.

His sister and her husband had just been murdered in their sleep, stabbed a total of 64 times, and the police wanted Martin del Campo to confess. They waved a typewritten statement in his face and ordered him to sign it. He told them he didn't kill anybody and wasn't going to sign anything.

Then came the plastic bag.

According to Martin del Campo, whose story was corroborated under oath by an officer who was suspended for torturing him, two cops held him by the arms while another put the bag over his head. ""That's one minute,"" he remembers the officer saying. ""Next we'll do it for two minutes, then three, until you confess."" They put the bag over his head again and again.

 

""I was sure they were going to kill me,"" Martin del Campo said.

So naked, bleeding and gasping for breath, he scratched his name at the bottom of a confession he did not write and had never read, admitting to a crime he said he did not commit. Based on that document and no direct physical evidence -- no witnesses, fingerprints, bloodstains, hairs or clothing fibers -- a judge convicted him of the double murder and sentenced him to 50 years in prison.

That was 10 years ago.

Martin del Campo, a U.S. citizen born in Chicago, now sits in prison in this city 40 miles north of Mexico City. His appeals are exhausted. Four different judges ruled that his allegations of torture were irrelevant. Confessions obtained by torture are not necessarily false, they ruled, repeating a conclusion reached frequently by Mexican judges.

The principle that someone charged with a crime is innocent until proven guilty does not exist in Mexico. Until 1984, federal law explicitly said a defendant was guilty until proven innocent. Although the presumption of guilt was later removed, it remains the practice -- defendants must still prove their innocence. Martin del Campo could not.

He is 37 now, and his hair is tinged with gray. His father moved to this small city to be near him, and he visits every day; his mother, who lives in Mexico City, comes on weekends. They said losing a daughter was devastating enough, and they want their son back.

""I have been legally kidnapped here, and I want to be free,"" Martin del Campo said, sitting in his tiny cell. ""The worst of this is losing my sister. But I am dead, too. I am dead in life.""

Confronting a Dark Legacy
Martin del Campo is a ghost in Mexico's closet, haunting this country as it tries to move beyond a history of authoritarian abuses. Even now, Mexico's record on torture is one of the worst in the world, according to the United Nations, Amnesty International and other groups.

It is a legacy that built up over generations. For much of the 20th century, Mexico was run by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Under its rigid system, from the president's gilded office to thousands of rural villages run by strong-arm political bosses, official power was wielded as a blunt and often brutal tool of control.

In a rule-of-law state, the law is a higher authority than the arbitrary actions of any individual, whether a police officer or president. But throughout recent Mexican history, it was the other way around: Party bosses were above the law. Police departments, especially in the countryside, were developed largely as political security forces to support local bosses, and not as investigative law enforcement units to solve crimes.

Fists and kicks and plastic bags have long been standard practice for solving cases. The innocent and the guilty have confessed simply to stop the pain. Prosecutors have been neglected. There has been little need to professionalize them when their chief function has been to present confessions to judges. ""They just look for a quick, easy solution to a crime, rather than the truth,"" said Emma Maza of the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Human Rights Center in Mexico City.

Mexican judges have also been part of the system that ruled above the law. The goal has been to keep the political bosses satisfied, resolving cases by whatever means necessary. ""To keep their jobs, they have to do what they are told,"" said human rights lawyer Pilar Noriega. Defense lawyers also have seen little chance to buck the system. Public defenders have been even more poorly trained and less likely to serve their clients well.

The PRI era ended in December 2000 with the swearing-in of President Vicente Fox, who was elected by voters fed up with the abuses and corruption of the PRI system. Fox has promised to clean up Mexico's human rights record, but Amnesty International and even Fox's top human rights adviser, Mariclaire Acosta, acknowledge that torture continues. Acosta said Fox's government was trying to pass new anti-torture laws, train police and soldiers not to beat confessions out of suspects, and enact reforms to prevent judges from accepting torture-induced confessions. But, she said: ""Those are still common practices. It's an abomination.""

Theoretically, torture is illegal in Mexico. The constitution prohibits ""all incommunicado detention, intimidation or torture"" and states that confessions made before anyone other than a prosecutor or a judge are not admissible in court. In 1986, Mexico began enacting laws to punish torture, and to make torture-induced confessions inadmissible in court. In addition, in 1987, Mexico ratified a U.N. convention against torture. Fox has invited U.N. human rights officials to set up an office in Mexico.

 

But Mexico is slow to change, and torture is still a common tool of the authorities. Last month, in Nuevo Leon state, a man suspected of robbing an ATM died of asphyxiation while in police custody. The state attorney general's office said it believed he died as the result of torture, and the case is under investigation. On Wednesday, the Durango state human rights commission concluded that five state police officers had tortured three murder suspects in March. Two weeks ago, the national human rights commission concluded that a suspected kidnapper who died in custody of federal police in March was beaten to death.

The challenge facing Mexico today is not only to enforce the ban on torture but to change the mind-set of a generation of police, prosecutors and judges, whose practices and beliefs were set in an earlier era. Acosta said the government faces enormous obstacles, including decades of official indifference to torture and other abuses. Just as important as preventing torture in the future, she added, is redressing wrongs of the past -- including victims of torture locked away in prisons.

Indelible Night
Sitting in his cell, next to a dirt field where other inmates played soccer, Martin del Campo, who has a round face and a soft voice, recounted the story he has told many times, about the early morning hours of May 30, 1992:

He woke to the sound of his sister, Patricia, screaming his name. She and her husband, Gerardo Zamudio Aldaba, slept in another bedroom in the Mexico City apartment they shared. The two men were partners in two businesses: importing carpets, and operating buses for the city. Patricia, 33, worked as a waitress and took care of the couple's three daughters, then 6, 4 and 2, who were sleeping in the next room.

Martin del Campo ran toward the screams. He was met at his bedroom door by two men with stockings over their heads. They called him by his nickname, Chacho, then, he remembers, they beat him. They forced him downstairs and threw him into the trunk of a car. They drove for about 30 minutes, until the car came to a crashing stop.

Martin del Campo heard the two men get out and run. He said he found a tire iron, smashed out a brake light and saw that he was on a highway, where the car had crashed into the concrete barrier dividing the road. He fiddled with a lock until the trunk popped open.

He flagged down a passing bus and rode it to the first tollbooth, where he ran to some police officers and told them what happened. The police drove him to the crashed car, where they found a bloody knife and started asking questions. They drove him back to his apartment, now surrounded by police cars and ambulances. A neighbor's teenage son told him that his sister and Zamudio were dead.

Police drove Martin del Campo to the station, where, he said, he was taken to a basement room and surrounded by a dozen police officers. The officer in charge, later identified to him as Sotero Galvan Gutierrez, asked him to tell his story. Martin del Campo said he told them everything. They made him tell the same story at least four times. Nobody wrote anything down, he recalled, and there was no tape recorder.

Finally, he said, one officer started hitting him, swore at him and said, ""Tell us how you did it -- how did you kill them?""

Martin del Campo said he was shocked. Then all the officers started taking turns hitting and kicking him. They made him strip naked and kept hitting him, some with wet towels wrapped around their fists to leave fewer marks. Eventually, he said, Galvan came to him with a typed statement and demanded he sign. He still refused.

Then came the plastic bag. And he finally signed.

""That made them very happy,"" he said.

Missing Pieces
The case against Martin del Campo, who had no previous criminal record, was made largely by Galvan, according to the court file. In Galvan's version, described in his investigative report, Martin del Campo was drunk and killed his sister and her husband because he was angry with his brother-in-law over a $70 car repair bill. He waited until the two were asleep, then stabbed them with kitchen knives. He smashed his own head and face, hard enough to cause deep cuts, and staged a phony kidnapping to cover up his crime, Galvan said in the report.

But hundreds of pages of court documents contain no evidence to support Galvan's version. They don't prove Martin del Campo's innocence either. But the record shows blood tests indicate he was not drunk. Lab tests showed that hairs found in the clenched fist of his sister when she died, presumably from her killer, were not Martin del Campo's. There were no witnesses, no blood-soaked clothes. There was no motive offered for why he would kill his sister.

Galvan offered as evidence a reconstruction of the events, based on his theory. Officers brought Martin del Campo back to the apartment, over his objections, and took 85 photos as they made him reach for knives in the kitchen, and forced him to pretend to stab the victims, played by two police officers posing in the bloody bed.

Reenactments are a common technique in Mexican criminal investigations and are often accepted as evidence in trials, although they are based on nothing more than a prosecutor's version of events. The trial judge, and several judges who considered Martin del Campo's appeals, cited the reenactment photos as evidence of his guilt, and an appeals judge called it ""convincing"" evidence, according to court documents.

Galvan said Martin del Campo was represented by a public defender during thereenactment. But the person listed by Galvan as defender was a police department computer specialist, court documents subsequently showed. The record also shows that a public defender eventually assigned to his case never argued that the confession should be excluded because of torture. An appeals court judge called the confession ""the only relevant piece of evidence"" against him.

During the trial, Martin del Campo was given the opportunity to question Galvan directly. He asked him if he and other officers had stripped him, beaten him, suffocated him with a plastic bag. The court record shows that, under oath, Galvan acknowledged that he had done it.

But the judge accepted the confession anyway, noting, as the appellate judges also did, that in Mexico, confessions obtained by torture are often still considered as evidence, despite the laws that say confessions obtained by torture are inadmissible.

In April 1993, Galvan shot and killed an unarmed man while on duty. He was convicted of murder, fired from the police force and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After serving five years, he was released for ""health reasons.""

In October 1994, acting as a result of Galvan's admission in the trial, the Mexico City attorney general's office punished Galvan for violating Martin del Campo's human rights. Although he had already been fired, his punishment was a three-year suspension from the police force. The notice was delivered to him in prison.

Galvan, in response to a message sent through an intermediary, said he would not comment on the case.

Martin del Campo also filed a complaint seeking criminal torture charges against Galvan. But prosecutors closed the case in 2000, saying there wasn't enough evidence, despite Galvan's admission that he had tortured Martin del Campo.

Enrique Flota, a top official in the prosecutor's office, was asked why Galvan didn't face criminal prosecution. ""That question has no answer,"" he said. ""It's something that we are going to look into. We are very worried that there were irregularities.""

In one sign of the potential for change, the leadership of the city attorney general's office has changed hands since 2000, when a new mayor was elected. In an office that had long been suspected of covering up abuses, several former private-sector human rights activists have been hired to high positions. Flota, for example, was previously a private defense lawyer who specialized in human rights cases.

Flota, who started his job in January, said he and others in his office were just now beginning to confront abuses from the past. They plan a complete review of Martin del Campo's case. ""There was a frequent practice of torture and irregularities by the police, we all know that,"" Flota said. ""In this case, we have to find out exactly what happened. We have many doubts about this case.""

Flota also said he planned to review why his predecessors never investigated a 1998 complaint filed by Martin del Campo's relatives in which they offered another version of the case. The complaint alleged that Zamudio's family arranged the murders to collect his inheritance. It also alleged that Patricia was killed to prevent her from inheriting her husband's assets, and Martin del Campo was spared so he would be blamed.

The complaint includes documents showing that Zamudio's brother and his mother ended up with all of his assets, as well as Martin del Campo's share of two small businesses in which he and Zamudio were partners.

Martin del Campo, speaking in the fluent English he picked up as a child in Chicago, said no one has ever investigated what he said was the obvious line of inquiry: ""In murder cases, the first question you ask is, 'Who benefited?' "" he said. ""Look at me. Did I benefit?""

Waiting for an End
With no legal appeals left, Martin del Campo has thrown his fate to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, an arm of the Organization of American States, which is reviewing his case to determine if the Mexican judicial system violated his rights. The commission's report is due by the end of the year. If it recommends his release, Acosta said, Fox would find a way to comply.

Martin del Campo has asked the U.S. government for help, but so far it has given him only vitamins and copies of Sports Illustrated, delivered every three months by an embassy official who checks on all U.S. citizens in Mexican prisons.

With 40 years left in his sentence, Martin del Campo passes his days working at a little snack shop in the prison. His father, 68, works alongside him during his daily visits. His mother, 67, spends much of her time trying to find her orphaned granddaughters, who are now 16, 14 and 12. A court awarded her custody of the girls in 1995, but she said Zamudio's family has them and she does not know where they are. ""This has all been the worst thing anyone could imagine,"" she said. ""It has been hell.""

Earlier last month, Martin del Campo married his longtime girlfriend, Janeth, in the prison. They had been dating at the time of the murders.

At the ceremony, they stood in a bare prison room before a priest, nuzzling and giggling and pledging to spend their lives together. It was almost normal, except that the photographer was a convicted drug dealer and the honeymoon trip was a walk past the guard tower to a prison cell.

""It's not how I'd like it to be,"" Martin del Campo said. ""But time is passing. I've had a lot of years of bad news. Now I want to have children, and a life."""
84,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"These gorgeous mountain slopes in central Mexico, blooming with black pepper plants and golden cornstalks, camouflage the sorrow of the two silent sisters. Antonia and Isabel Francisco Melendez, who were born deaf, are nine months pregnant, and the doctors treating them say they were raped.

The sisters, who cannot speak, cry and crumple, and literally fold up, when asked how they got pregnant. Their babies are due at the same time, within a week or so. Do they know the man? Did it happen in the fields on their way home from school? Isabel seemed to try to answer once, to her grandmother, by pointing to a spot high on a mountainside before tears streamed down her face and she turned away again.

Antonia is 13 years old, and Isabel 16. Perhaps if they were older, the pregnancies would have been easier to keep secret, the way rapes and beatings of women are usually dealt with in Mexico. But in this little town of fewer than 500 people, a place where the church bells toll every afternoon at 5 to call everyone to say the rosary, the reality is hard to hide. The girls' tiny frames swell more each day. Their backs and legs are sore -- not from playing tag with schoolmates, but because their bodies are telling them they will soon be mothers.

""This is a crime and there should be an investigation,"" said Juana Maria Diego Victor, a community leader in this village 85 miles northeast of Puebla city. ""Someone should protect these girls.""

Mexico is struggling to modernize its justice system, but when it comes to punishing sexual violence against women, surprisingly little has changed in a century. In many parts of Mexico, the penalty for stealing a cow is harsher than the punishment for rape.

Although the law calls for tough penalties for rape -- up to 20 years in prison -- only rarely is there an investigation into even the most barbaric of sexual violence. Women's groups estimate that perhaps 1 percent of rapes are ever punished. Although the two girls' medical charts say their pregnancies were the ""product of rape,"" no police authority has looked into the case.

In recent decades, Mexico has made strides to improve women's rights and opportunities. Mexican women still have much higher illiteracy rates than men, but that is slowly changing as young girls are staying in school longer. During the 1990s, laws that trampled women's rights were abolished, such as those that said married women needed their husband's permission to hold a job outside the home.

But in the country that made the term ""machismo"" famous, where women were given the right to vote only in 1953, women's rights advocates said rape and other violence against women are still not treated as serious crimes. And they said police, prosecutors and judges often show indifference or hostility toward women who claim rape -- such as in the case of Yessica Yadira Diaz Cazares.

Diaz testified that three police officers raped her in 1997, when she was 16, as she was on her way home from school in the northern city of Durango. She then did a rare thing: She tried to punish her attackers.

When she went to the police station with her mother, she was jeered and then jailed overnight. They forced her, as is mandatory in Mexico, to have a physical vaginal exam by a government doctor. They made her submit to eight separate blood tests, telling her, falsely, that the tests would determine whether she had been raped. But no one ever told her what the lab results were.

When the teenager did not back off, even after her family received death threats, a prosecutor told her that to identify the officers who attacked her, she must physically lay her hand on them. It was not good enough to point out her attackers. She needed to touch them, she was instructed. When she reached out and touched an officer, he taunted her and told her she was crazy.

Finally she gave up. She told her sister she was tired of seeking justice. Three months later, the young girl with big brown eyes and long, wavy hair killed herself with an overdose of prescription drugs. After her burial, the national human rights commission took up her case and helped convict two officers of rape.

""They make the few women who dare to report rape give up,"" said Yessica's mother, Maria Eugenia Cazares, who said her daughter's rape and death shattered the family's life. After her daughter's suicide, she moved her family to Canada where, she said, there are more enlightened laws to protect women.

""In 90 percent of the cases of rape, the Mexican police blame the women,"" she said in an interview. ""In the few cases where they know the man is guilty, they let him 'fix' it with money.""

She said she believes that a ""machismo culture,"" instilled through what is learned in the home, school and church, has allowed many men to ""believe they are superior and dominant, and that women are an object."" She said that mind-set has contributed to making many men -- including policemen, prosecutors, judges and others in positions of authority -- believe that sexual violence against women is no big deal.

""The thinking is 'she's a woman, so she deserved it,' or 'he's a man, so what do you expect?' "" said Cazares.

Rape in Mexico is prosecuted at the state level, and state laws vary. A review of criminal laws in all 31 Mexican states showed that many states require that if a 12-year-old girl wants to accuse an adult man of statutory rape, she must first prove she is ""chaste and pure."" Nineteen of the states require that statutory rape charges be dropped if the rapist agrees to marry his victim.

""What message is this? That the crime is not serious,"" said Elena Azaola, author of ""The Crime of Being a Women,"" a book about how the Mexican justice system discriminates against women.

In order for a woman to file a criminal complaint alleging rape, she must submit to a medical exam by a doctor assigned by the prosecutor's office. Patricia Duarte, president of the Mexican Association Against Violence Against Women, said these exams, routinely conducted in the prosecutor's office, are often carried out with little sensitivity or privacy. The exams, she said, are an obstacle to reporting rape that contributes to ""impunity of rapists"" in Mexico.

Fighting Old Customs
Whatever problems women face in the cities and towns, they are compounded in small villages where old customs are still the only true law. Ten million Mexicans are indigenous, as are most of the people in these highlands of the Sierra Madre. In Mexico's march toward modernity, there is great tension here between protecting women from violence and honoring indigenous customs.

In many of the thousands of indigenous communities, by longstanding custom, women are essentially servants of their fathers, brothers and husbands. In many villages around Reyeshogpan, women are forbidden to go out after dusk without their husband or their husband's permission. After 7 p.m., streets in village after village are populated by men only, many of them drunk. Alcoholism is another problem that contributes to violence against women.

Town elders who act as judges in local criminal matters are invariably men. In one village in Guerrero state, elders were recently asked how they punish rape. The six men looked confused, as if they did not know what the term meant. When it was explained to them, they all laughed and said it sounded more like a courting ritual than a crime.

When they stopped laughing, they said a rapist would probably get a few hours in the local jail, or he might have to pay the victim's family a $10 or $20 fine, but that all would be forgotten if he and the victim got married.

In the case of a cow thief, they said, the robber would be jailed. And, unlike the rapist, a cow thief would be brought before the elders for a lecture about the severity of the crime.

In the southern state of Oaxaca last summer, the one-year-old, government-funded Oaxacan Women's Institute persuaded the legislature to pass heavy criminal penalties against a practice known as ""rapto."" Laws in most Mexican states define rapto as a case where a man kidnaps a woman not for ransom, but with the intent of marrying her or to satisfy his ""erotic sexual desire."" The new law championed by the women's group established penalties of at least 10 years in prison.

But in March, the state legislature reversed itself and again made the practice a minor infraction. A key legislator -- a man -- argued for the reduction, calling the practice harmless and ""romantic.""

Human rights groups disagree. They say it is not charming for a man to spot a woman he fancies sitting in a park, pick her up and carry her away to have sex with her. Yet to this day, that is still how some women meet their husbands. The attorney general's office said there have been 137 criminal complaints of rapto in the state of Puebla since January 2000.

Complete statistics are impossible to find, because most cases are settled between the two families involved and never reported. Because rapto implies that the girl was taken away for sex, her parents want to avoid the shame associated with making a public complaint to police.

In some cases, the girls voluntarily go with the man as a way to elope to avoid wedding expenses. But Gabriela Gutierrez Kleman, a lawyer with the Oaxacan Women's Institute, said in many cases the women are taken against their will.

Gutierrez said it is hard to ask girls to complain about rapto, to buck a system that has changed little since their great-grandmother's time. If they do, she said, the family or the community often ""treats them as outcasts.""

Marriage as a Remedy
The regional maternity hospital in Zacapoaxtla caters to women and children from scores of villages in the highlands here in the northeast corner of Puebla state. White-coated doctors and nurses scurry about among the crying children, past brightly painted walls decorated with basic information about nutrition, breast-feeding and sanitation.

About 220 babies are born there each month, many of them to mothers who are children themselves. Hospital officials said babies are born there frequently to girls as young as 12, many of whom do not understand that intercourse caused their pregnancy.

The pregnancy of a child that age implies a crime: In Puebla, it is illegal to have sex with a person younger than 18. But only rarely are rape charges filed in these cases.

Teresa Arrieta Martinez, 13, petite and hugely pregnant, cringed as a nurse took a blood sample as part of her prenatal care. Her boyfriend, Eliazar Hernandez Martinez, a 20-year-old grocery store manager, stood outside in the waiting room.

About seven months ago, when Teresa was 12, Hernandez had sex with her and she became pregnant. Because of her age, the law says that Hernandez committed statutory rape. But it was not the police who came after him; it was Teresa's mother, Maria Juana Martinez.

""He could go to jail. If he doesn't carry through on his promise to marry her, I'll have to report him,"" she said. ""I'll sue him if he fails her.""

In most states marriage is a legal remedy for statutory rape. Women's groups say if the penalties were harsher, statutory rape cases would not be so common. As it is now, a man can agree to a wedding to avoid going to jail, and then abandon the woman. Social workers say many unhappy, abusive marriages begin with statutory rape.

Any day, Antonia and Isabel, the two deaf sisters, are due to deliver their babies at the same hospital. Antonia, the 13-year-old, lives with her mother in a small house near the main road of Reyeshogpan, a tiny village with little more than a church, basketball court and general store. Antonia is carrying her baby in the breach position, so her doctors expect a difficult delivery.

Isabel, 16, lives with her 95-year-old grandfather in a small wooden house nearby. It is at the bottom of a ravine lined with cornstalks, a challenging 30-minute climb straight down from where her mother, stepfather and sister live. No one seems quite sure how Isabel will be able to make the climb up to get to the hospital once she is in labor.

Isabel passes her days sitting on a log at her front door, staring off into the cornfields or embroidering. She wears her silky brown hair neatly tied up, her white dress and apron are impeccably clean and she folds her hands nervously over her huge belly.

The girls' mother, Ventura Melendez, 35, communicates with them using rudimentary sign language and drawings. When she asked Isabel if she had any pain, the girl put her arm against her lower back. She nodded when asked if she is scared about being such a young mother.

Melendez said she prefers not to dwell on how they got pregnant. ""What happened to them happens to a lot of girls,"" she said. ""We don't want justice. We don't want trouble.""

But Diego Victor, the neighbor who has known the girls since they were born, said she is angry that what happened to the girls will never be punished.

""They deserve better,"" she said."
85,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"Giovanni Hurtado Aviles was hurrying to his engineering class when he realized he didn't have the two pesos -- about 20 cents -- for the subway. When he tried to use somebody's else's pass to get on, he was caught and hauled to jail. ""I made a mistake. I am really sorry. I won't do it again,"" Hurtado, 20, said he told the guard who nabbed him that January morning.

But the Mexican justice system, which often fails to punish serious criminals, zealously prosecutes the most minor of offenders. So the college student with no criminal record was denied bail and forced to mop floors for 12 hours a day for two months while he awaited trial.

""Our justice system is not just,"" said the Rev. Jose Luis Tellez, a Roman Catholic priest and lawyer who tries to get such prisoners freed. ""The real criminals are at home in their houses while these people are in jail.""

Mexico's courts and jails are clogged with people like Hurtado, people who stole a bicycle, bread, shampoo, subway fare. More than half of the 22,000 prisoners in Mexico City's jails are there for offenses so slight that human rights advocates -- and increasingly, city officials -- say they never should have been jailed in the first place.

According to recent testimony to the Mexican Congress by top law enforcement officials, well over 90 percent of serious crime goes unpunished. In a nation with one of the world's highest kidnapping rates, much drug-related bloodshed and a chilling level of violence on the streets of the capital, the prisons are choked with people who stole to eat. Tellez said a man who stole a Gansito, similar to a Twinkie, was released in November after spending three years in jail. He said another man who stole bread worth about $4 was sentenced to six years.

Public opinion polls show that Mexicans are fed up with their justice system. One of the key complaints is that it thunders down so hard on petty criminals. At every turn, the system is consumed with the smallest crimes: Poorly trained police focus on the easiest crimes to solve; corrupt officers, often paid to look the other way when there is more serious crime, have no such incentive to let small-time offenders go. Legislators under political pressure to combat rising crime rates have set tough minimum sentences for the smallest of robberies.

The result is that in many cases, as with Hurtado, the subway cheater, judges are forced by the law to hand down sentences they believe are unfair. Judges in Mexico have almost no discretionary authority. The Mexican legal system, based in 19th century Napoleonic Code, deliberately limits the role of judges. The theory is that legislators should craft penalties and judges should simply impose them.

The judge in Hurtado's case wanted to be lenient but said the law would not let him. He convicted Hurtado of ""using a false document"" -- showing a subway worker's pass that Hurtado said he had found on the floor. That is the equivalent of a felony, a crime considered too grave to warrant bail, punishable by a minimum of four years in prison. Behind bars, Hurtado vomited from nervousness. He fell far behind on his class work and lost wages from an after-school job.

""What my son did wasn't a crime; it was a mistake,"" said his mother, Laura Aviles Rodriguez. ""Who would call this justice?""

A Well-Connected Defendant
Behind the high brick walls of a Mexico City development called Poinsettia, amid gardens of purple bougainvillea and expensive SUVs parked in a row on the cobblestones, Oscar Espinosa Villareal lives the life of an accused embezzler with means.

Espinosa, Mexico City's mayor from 1994 to 1997, is accused of illegally diverting $45 million that was never accounted for during his term. When a judge issued a warrant for his arrest in August 2000, he did what many wealthy Mexicans do in the same situation: He bought a plane ticket and fled the country. His top aide is still a fugitive.

Espinosa flew to Canada and then Nicaragua, where he was caught. He maintains he has done nothing illegal and that he is the victim of a revenge campaign by his political enemies. He fought extradition on grounds that the case against him amounted to political persecution, but the Nicaraguans sent him home.

Espinosa is part of the well-connected old guard of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ran Mexico from 1929 to 2000. He served as campaign finance manager for his old friend, Ernesto Zedillo, who became president and rewarded Espinosa with the mayor's job, a presidentially appointed position until 1997. When Espinosa's term expired, Zedillo appointed him to serve as national tourism minister from 1997 to 2000.

When Espinosa arrived back in Mexico on a federal police jet from Nicaragua, his wealth and connections kicked in. He hired one of Mexico's leading lawyers, who persuaded a federal judge to issue an order forbidding his arrest and detention, allowing him to remain free pending trial. Espinosa was ordered to post bail of about $400,000. He paid about $12,000 in cash, put up his house to cover the balance, and then went home.

Based on Mexico's long history of elites beating criminal charges, few here believe Espinosa will ever be convicted. It is a story Mexicans know well: Accused of stealing $45 million, Espinosa sleeps in his own bed at night, while Hurtado, who sneaked a 20-cent subway ride, was forced to sleep on a jailhouse cot for months awaiting trial.

Francisco Garduno, the former head of prisons for Mexico City, has given speeches to inmates citing Espinosa as an example of how those accused of major crimes get better treatment than minor offenders, who are invariably poor. ""The road to justice opens up wide for them,"" Garduno said. ""But for the poor it is very narrow.""

Behind Bars for Lack of Funds
Far from Espinosa's hillside retreat, in a rough neighborhood in the southeast side of the city, Tellez, the Catholic priest, runs a church program to get minor offenders out of jail.

Frustrated with the government's approach to petty criminals, the church has quietly begun its own effort to help. The church pays fines and bail for thousands of nonviolent petty criminals, most of them first offenders. People convicted of a crime are often allowed to choose jail time or a fine. Tellez said he has handled cases of many who could have avoided jail or served less time by paying a fine of as little as $25.

""It absolutely is unfair that money determines freedom,"" Tellez said.

Church lawyers last year reviewed the files of 11,000 prisoners in Mexico City jails, half the city's inmates. They concluded that at least 4,000 were minor offenders stuck behind bars because they could not afford to pay fines or bail. In all, the church has arranged for the release of 4,100 people.

A private foundation, supported by Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, the country's largest telephone company, has paid for the release of 20,000 minor offenders in the last five years.

The foundation spokesman, Mario Cobo Trujillo, said cases have included a man, charged with injuring another man in a fight, who spent eight months in jail awaiting trial until the foundation paid his $25 bail. Cobo said another man spent more than 18 months awaiting trial for want of $100 for bail.

Mexico's culture of official secrecy has kept the extent of the problem hidden. Until recently all prison records in Mexico were considered confidential, and they are still difficult to obtain. That has made it hard to document how the system has been primarily focused on the least significant crimes.

But now that church lawyers and human rights workers are being given access, members of the public are getting their first glimpses at the make-up of the prison population. What they are finding has sparked a drive to substitute restitution and community service for prison time for minor offenders.

Laws Limit Judges' Authority
Hurtado's case was handled by Judge Eduardo Mata, a chain-smoking former prosecutor. ""Ever since I got this case, I thought it was a shame,"" Mata said in an interview in his glass-walled courthouse office. ""He just did something stupid. But there was nothing I could do.""

Mata, who has been a judge for nine years, said the case was a frustrating reminder of the strict limits on his authority and how minor offenders end up behind bars.

""I think we need reforms that give judges more freedom,"" he said. ""We don't have the flexibility we need.""

A Mexican judge's main task is to read files and issue a sentence that falls between the minimum and maximum penalty established in the criminal codes. In Mexico there are no jury trials. And in many cases, the judge never even sees the defendant, issuing his decision based on the written record. Limiting the judge's authority is meant to limit bribery and other corruption on the bench.

""Our hands are tied by the law,"" Mata said. ""We can't do anything if we think the minimum sentence is unfair.""

Mata recalled a case in which a young man stole a bag of bread from a woman in a Mexico City market. Police grabbed him immediately, and they and the thief discovered that the woman had also stuffed 40,000 pesos -- about $4,500 -- into the bag after a trip to the bank.

Mata said he wanted to sentence the man based on his intention, which he said was to steal a loaf of bread. But because the man had committed a major robbery, even unwittingly, Mata said, the law required him to sentence him to several years in prison.

In Hurtado's case, Mata said the best he could do was issue the minimum sentence for his crime: four years in prison and a fine of about $950. Mata said he then used the only wiggle room the law allowed him, letting Hurtado substitute an additional fine of about $560 for his prison time.

""He didn't damage society in any way,"" Mata said. ""I didn't like the sentence I had to give him. Our laws aren't that fair.""

Gaunt and defeated, Hurtado walked out of jail on March 13 after 63 days behind bars.

A former employer lent him more than $1,500 to pay his fines, allowing him to avoid a prison sentence that would have kept him locked up until 2006. That makes him luckier than most. But it will take every peso of his earnings -- and his mother's -- for more than a year to pay back his debt.

Former prison chief Garduno, who now runs the city's transportation department, is outraged at how the system treated Hurtado and how it punishes the wrong people. So he gave him a city job to help him pay off his debts.

""I am trying to repair the damage done to our society,"" Garduno said. ""I am trying to rectify something that has happened to thousands of people in Mexico."""
86,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"The videotapes and photos arrived every few days. They showed a young woman, bound and scared, crying out as her kidnappers slapped her face and beat her. The pictures, the sounds of pain, tore at her uncle Gerardo like a dull razor.

""When do you want us to stop?"" the kidnappers asked on the tapes, and in phone calls that always came between 2 and 4 in the morning. They threatened that the next time they would send her tongue, her eye, her ears, her fingers. They wanted $5 million in ransom, and they offered specific suggestions about which of Gerardo's properties and businesses he could sell to raise it.

He didn't call the police. The kidnappers said they would kill his niece, his mother, his children if he did. From the extent of the kidnappers' information about him, he suspected that the police were involved anyway, as they are in so many cases here. Police cars parked outside his office and his mother's house seemed like a warning he didn't dare ignore.

Gerardo said he considers himself brave, a steel-spined businessman, tough as his Lebanese grandparents who moved to Mexico at the turn of the last century. But the cries of his 19-year-old niece, kidnapped at the point of a machine gun as she walked to school, were more than he could take. And, he said, the words -- ""When do you want us to stop?"" -- haunted him.

""They get one of your kids and they finish you,"" he said.

At least once a day in Mexico, someone is kidnapped for ransom, ruining lives and extracting a punishing economic cost from the victims and their companies. It has become so common here that being abducted at gunpoint and held for weeks or months has become part of the fabric of life, an accepted risk, a simple cost of doing business.

Mexican businessmen are overwhelmingly the victims, largely because Mexico has developed a culture in which ransoms are quickly paid and the police are rarely notified. According to court records and interviews with victims and security specialists, police are often involved in kidnappings, and a weak and corrupt judicial system often means they won't be caught.

This article is another in an occasional series about how Mexico remains a nation lacking rule of law. President Vicente Fox took office almost two years ago promising to tackle the legacy of corruption that developed during seven decades of authoritarian one-party rule. But as he struggles against these deeply entrenched forces, Mexico is still a place where criminals carry out the cruelest of acts knowing they are safely beyond the law.

""Criminals do risk analysis,"" said Jorge Septien, a private security specialist. ""They know that less than 1 percent of criminals end up in jail because there's so much corruption and impunity. The government is giving the message to criminals that crime is a good business.""

Fifteen years ago, kidnapping barely existed here. But crime began increasing here in the 1980s and an economic crash in 1994-95 seemed to make fundamental changes in Mexico, turning kidnapping -- and crime generally -- into a growth industry. Kidnappings decreased some in the late 1990s, but analysts said they are again increasing in a society where people feel the authorities do not protect them.

Last year, businessman Eduardo Gallo conducted his own investigation into the kidnapping and murder of his 25-year-old daughter, Paola. Furious with police inaction, Gallo began a private probe that eventually nabbed the killers. He recently published a book on his travails called ""Paola: Denunciation of a Kidnapping and of a Corrupt Society.""

Officials at Coparmex, the country's largest and most influential employers' association, said they know of at least 360 kidnappings last year; they already know of 331 in the first eight months of this year. There are no reliable and complete statistics available. But security firms say the actual numbers are many times higher than what Coparmex has recorded, leaving Mexico and Colombia in a league of their own in Latin American kidnappings.

Kidnapping has become such an industry in Mexico that no one is immune: Maids are held for $500 in ransom; a 12-year-old Tijuana girl was kidnapped this year by college students trying to raise money for school; people fake their own kidnappings to collect from their own families or businesses.

Executives are still the most lucrative target, including foreigners. The daughter of the local head of a Japanese tire manufacturer was kidnapped in 2000, and the company paid more than $1 million in ransom. The chief of a German car manufacturer's Mexican operation left the country about 18 months ago after his wife was kidnapped and a $1 million ransom was paid. A Spanish banker left this summer after he was kidnapped and released.

""It's not unusual for people to take their whole families and leave the country,"" said the president of Coparmex, Jorge Espina Reyes. ""Once someone suffers a kidnapping in their family, it affects them for the rest of their lives. They're willing to do anything, leave their country and their business, so that they won't ever have to live through that experience again.""

An Unending Ordeal
Six months after the kidnapping, Gerardo said he is still too frightened of the kidnappers to allow his last name to be used in this article. He said his niece, an architecture student, was held for more than a month in a small, dark room with the television turned up loud day and night. She told him four of her captors slept in the room with her. They never sexually assaulted her, but their presence in the flickering light of the TV every night added to her terror.

Another kidnapping victim, a teenage boy, was being held in the same house. The niece told Gerardo that she never saw him, but she could hear him, listening through the wall as the kidnappers stripped him and beat him until he cried, and videotaped it all for his parents. As they hit the boy, over and over, she heard them say the words her own family had come to dread: ""When do you want us to stop?""

As the patriarch of an extended family, and as the clear target of the kidnappers' demands, it fell to Gerardo to negotiate. He said he eventually paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in ransom, but he would not say exactly how much.

He got his niece back in March, but the ordeal didn't end. He said the kidnappers kept calling him, threatening to kill his children if he made trouble for them, if he called the police. Once, he said, they called to let him know they were sitting outside his mother's house. They described the place to him, told him what his mother was doing just then. And they said they were going to kill her.

""You go crazy,"" Gerardo said. He said he bought a gun.

Then a few weeks ago he sold his Mercedes, put his house on the market and moved his family permanently to Boca Raton, Fla., unable to endure the insecurity he felt constantly in the country where he was born. His niece is now studying architecture in Florida and his children are in school there.

""I can't live here anymore,"" said Gerardo, 45, a fit and trim marathon runner, as he sat among boxes in his Mexico City office on the day before he left. ""We have to change our lives. I have a 5-year-old boy. I can't risk him.""

He said the businesses he built over a lifetime, manufacturing and selling auto parts and selling real estate, will surely go bankrupt and his 35 employees will lose their jobs. He said he would try to manage his businesses from Florida and with discreet return trips every few months. But he said they require more hands-on management than that, and that the kidnappers have forced him into ruin.

He said he spent $150,000 to hire two private investigators to look into his case, and they told him his niece was abducted by a well-organized gang led by state and local police officers. They were too well-connected and too organized to fight, he concluded. ""You can buy anyone with the money they are making,"" he said.

They have taunted him on the phone, telling him, ""You will never catch us, we know too much,"" he recalled. And they did know a lot. ""They taped our phone conversations about two or three months before the kidnapping and replayed them for us. They checked our property records, they knew about our cars and houses. They did an inventory. They said, 'Tell your mother to sell her condo to pay the ransom.' ""

Gerardo said he was angry, that he would like to kill someone. But he said the forces against him were too strong to fight, so his only option was to run. He has never reported the case to the police.

""You work, you study, you get married, have kids, a life, stability,"" he said. ""I was going to stay here always. But now we and our money are leaving Mexico.""

High Cost to Victims
Pedro Fletes Renteria, director of a private school in Mexico City, was kidnapped as he arrived for work at 6 a.m. on March 1, 2001. Masked men with pistols forced him into a car and put him facedown on the floor with a gun to his neck. He was held for 59 days.

Fletes said he was kept for most of that time in a five-foot-square closet, with a bucket to use as a toilet. He was allowed to bathe every three days. Outside, he could hear children playing, families having parties -- the sounds of Mexico City's warm springtime.

Fletes, 54, said the kidnappers knew everything about him, including his children's names and his schedule. He said the only thing they didn't seem to understand was his business: Their $5 million ransom demand was more than the school's total worth.

""I felt every emotion you can imagine, in cycles: anguish, desperation, thinking badly of my family, thinking I would die, crying,"" said Fletes, whose face is soft and round beneath a salt-and-pepper beard. ""It was so inhumane.""

After almost two months, after his family paid a ransom he won't disclose, the kidnappers drove him to a busy downtown intersection and let him out. They gave him back the suit he was wearing on the day he was taken. It had been cleaned and pressed.

Fletes said the kidnapping nearly broke him financially. He said his wife, five daughters and a son spent thousands of dollars for bodyguards and armored cars after he was kidnapped. After he was released, he hired a team of bodyguards to protect him for several months.

""But I got rid of all that,"" he said, tapping the desk with his hands, which flutter around him constantly like nervous birds. ""It was too expensive, and I didn't want to live that way.""

The costs to his school, which runs from elementary grades through high school, continue. Since his kidnapping, he has paid more than $18,000 to install a closed-circuit television security system and motion-sensing alarms. He pays more than $5,500 a month for security measures he never took before, including new guards at the doors and new identification cards and security procedures for his 1,200 students.

He said he'd rather spend that money for a new language laboratory, paint for the school's cracked yellow walls and upgrades to the school's 40 outdated computers.

""If we didn't have to spend so much for security now,"" he said, ""we could make everything here better.""

Investing in Security
Companies in Mexico pay dearly to protect themselves because the government doesn't. Analysts said big companies typically spend between 5 percent and 15 percent of their annual budgets on security -- sometimes $2 million or more.

In a country where more than 54 million people -- more than half the population -- live on less than $4.50 a day, business leaders said their heavy spending on security represents lost jobs and lost opportunities.

""Instead of investing in security, they could be investing in new factories or new lines of products,"" said Javier Prieto de la Fuente, president of Concamin, Mexico's Industrial Chamber of Commerce. ""When you are dealing with global markets, even 1 percent is important. We are losing our competitive edge because of these concerns.""

While many parts of Mexico are relatively safe from the kidnapping epidemic, problems are severe in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puebla and U.S. border areas where much of the nation's manufacturing is located. Many Japanese executives at factories near the border are forbidden by their companies to drive in private cars. Buses with armed guards carry Japanese executives between their homes in the San Diego suburbs and their factories around Tijuana.

Foreign companies pay premiums -- the equivalent of hazard pay -- to lure top executives to Mexico. Foreign and Mexican firms often must buy kidnapping insurance for their top corporate officers. The problem is severe enough that a company here has begun offering surgical implants of devices that could help locate people using satellite technology, although as of recently it had no takers.

Few, if any, companies have left the country strictly over security concerns, as Mexico is simply too big and attractive a market to abandon. Foreign direct investment continues to grow, but many here say kidnappings and other crimes are a key reason Mexico's economy has not grown faster.

Kidnapping has become so common that Fox mentioned it prominently in his annual state of the nation address this month. Crime analysts say the federal government's new elite anti-kidnapping unit is an important step. But even Fox conceded that wiping out the ""scourge"" of insecurity was still ""an outstanding debt to our citizens.""

'We Don't Trust the Police'
Fletes said he never wanted the police involved in his case.

""We don't trust the police, and we want to protect our families,"" he said. ""I know of two other kidnapping cases right now, and neither of them has been reported.""

But he said that at the moment he was kidnapped, one of the kidnappers fired shots -- perhaps as a warning. That caused so much commotion that police came, and an investigation was started.

Fletes said the Federal Preventative Police was the lead agency in the investigation. But Fletes said his brother negotiated directly with the kidnappers, without any police involvement, and eventually paid the ransom himself.

Once Fletes was returned, the search for the kidnappers was turned over to the Mexico City attorney general's office, which has a special unit dedicated to kidnapping investigations.

""I can say they are very friendly, but not very effective,"" Fletes said. ""I think their attitude is that once the victim is returned, the case is solved.""

His own private investigators turned up evidence that top Mexico City police officers might have been involved in the case. Fletes's attorney, Jose Antonio Ortega, a prominent lawyer who heads the security committee of Coparmex, said telephone records show that the cell phone used by the kidnappers was also used to make calls to the home of a top official from the department's anti-kidnapping unit.

Jesus Jimenez Granados, head of the attorney general's anti-kidnapping unit, said he investigated the claims and found no evidence that the police had been involved. But he said the officers suspected of involvement had been transferred to another unit anyway. He said that on a matter as delicate as kidnapping investigations, police and investigators had to be totally beyond suspicion.

""People have to trust us,"" said Jimenez, a stocky bull of a man in a suit made for someone taller. ""We think we're giving citizens results and earning their trust.""

Jimenez said his office received 149 complaints of kidnappings last year and solved 70 percent of them. Jimenez also said police had a suspect in custody who may have been involved in Fletes's kidnapping. ""It's about to be resolved completely,"" he said.

But Fletes remained skeptical, and scared. Sitting in his office, just a few feet from the street where he was kidnapped, Fletes said the police officers he suspects were involved in his kidnapping could ""come back at any time.""

Fletes said Fox's election two years ago was a positive sign, and that some things are beginning to change. But he said Mexico is still a land too often governed more by force and intimidation than by laws. He said his nephew had been ""express kidnapped"" this month by abductors who held him for a few hours and forced him to withdraw money with his ATM card -- a common crime in Mexico City that is almost never solved.

""We've had a political transition,"" Fletes said. ""But Mexico still needs a transition of justice."""
87,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"The walls are 15 feet high and topped with jagged glass and barbed wire, ugly keepers of ugly secrets. For years they stood sentry over abuses of scores of children in state care, who were forced to eat pig food, beaten, even tied to trees for days at a time.

Beto, a homeless boy, was 10 years old when the police brought him here after they caught him stealing two shiny gold buttons from a store bin. He thought he might be going somewhere better than the street.

Instead, Betulio Chi Tzec spent the next five years behind the walls of the Yucatan state juvenile correctional facility, a little boy locked in a dormitory room with two teenagers convicted of rape.

Beto, as well as a teacher and a physician who worked there, said the woman who ran the youth detention home regularly beat the 50 children in her care. They said she kicked the children in the genitals, slapped them and sheared off their hair in fits of rage. Beto said she told the children, ""You are all going to rot here,"" and he came to believe she was right.

According to youths who have spent time inside the system, as well as parents, government officials and many experts here, children are frequently mistreated, abused and forgotten in Mexico's ""little jails,"" as the youth lockups are known. Officially called ""schools for young offenders,"" many of these places are nothing more than cold prisons where classroom teaching is rare.

There are 4,200 children living in dozens of detention centers across Mexico. Conditions vary, and some centers are well run. But many operate the same way they did a century ago: out of public view and with little or no internal regulation or outside supervision. Parents are often barred from entering, though they are encouraged to slip money to guards to prevent harsher treatment of their children.

The Mexican government, battered by crime, has displayed little concern or tolerance for children who break the law. That indifference, as well as the secrecy that shrouds the detention centers, has perpetuated shoddy and often cruel practices, according to those with firsthand experience in the troubled system.

""These institutions are horrible,"" said Elena Azaola, a criminal justice specialist who has conducted studies of the juvenile centers. ""The children live in misery.""

Mexico relies on an informal and largely unregulated system of juvenile justice that has existed for decades. Children who break the law often have no access to an attorney. Administrative judges who handle juvenile cases set sentences, but there is often no judicial follow-up once children are sent to detention homes.

The real power is held by the directors of the centers. They effectively decide how long a child will be held and under what conditions. The directors are appointed by governors or other top officials in each of Mexico's 31 states.

""For children there is no system of justice. They are the victims of arbitrary decisions by those in charge,"" said Guillermo Alonso Angulo, a consultant for UNICEF in Yucatan state.

A system that abuses children and fails to punish the abusers is a legacy of the one-party rule that dominated Mexico for most of the 20th century. From 1929 until 2000, Mexico's presidents, and most of its governors, mayors, police and local officials -- including those in charge of youth programs -- belonged to the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

During that era, government jobs were dispensed more out of political loyalty than expertise. People running programs intended to benefit society often did little other than steal agency funds. Because of the party's hammerlock on power, they rarely had to answer to the public.

President Vicente Fox, who took office in 2000, has promised to create a new day for justice in Mexico. He has vowed that the law, not the personal or political whims of officials, will reign.

Now, the children locked away in detention centers are trying to hold him to his word.

Nearly every week recently, youths have climbed onto the roofs of their detention homes, setting fires and starting small riots to draw attention to their living conditions. When reporters arrive, the children yell over the wall that they have been beaten with brooms and belts.

On Oct. 2, in the western state of Nayarit, 37 children took over a detention center, throwing stones and screaming that they were ""tired of the beatings."" The day before, in the northern state of Sonora, 40 children brawled with their keepers, complaining about brutality. Similar uprisings have occurred in six other states and Mexico City this year, as angry children demand better treatment in their little jails.

Allegations of Cruelty
Mexico is struggling to transform itself into a nation where people feel protected -- not menaced -- by the law. Yet old ways prevail, as seen in the horrors of the Yucatan detention center.

The director, Maria del Rocio Martel Lopez, was a physician who had superb local political connections. Some who knew her recalled that she was tall, thin, blond and impeccably dressed.

Dozens of children under her care have now come forward to say she brutalized them. According to the findings of an investigation by the National Human Rights Commission, which issued a report in April, Martel presided for four years over an institution with ""cruel and degrading treatment"" of children, which included ""denigrating punishments, humiliations, beatings and mistreatment.""

Allegations of cruelty by Martel were reported to the governor's office as early as 1999. But the powerful, longtime governor who appointed her, Victor Cervera Pacheco, did nothing. Many here attribute his inaction to Martel's social and political standing; she is the widow of a former powerful party boss in the state.

A Merida radio station aired a report in 1999 about the allegations against Martel, but the reporter, Jose Luis Preciado, said he was pressured by state officials to drop the matter.

""Sometimes she would tell boys to pull down their pants and she would kick them in their private parts until they cried,"" Beto said of Martel, echoing testimony given to human rights investigators by people who worked at the center.

Psychologists and teachers, in interviews and in their statements to investigators and police, said that Martel beat children until they bled. Several recalled how she forced one homosexual boy to dress like a girl.

Many of Martel's accusers cited the case of a teenage orphan, Catalina Gijon Granados. She was held in the center for four years, often in windowless isolation, even though she had committed no crime.

Dulce Maria Alavez Soberanes, who taught crafts at the detention center, called Martel's treatment of Catalina ""unforgivable."" She said that Catalina was beautiful, sweet and relatively well-adjusted until she landed on Martel's bad side. After months of mistreatment, Alavez said Catalina appeared lost and disoriented and became a chronic bed-wetter, a skinny girl with sickly yellow hollow eyes.

""She was locked up for almost two months in a room without a window, given just one meal a day,"" Alavez said. ""When she was let out, it was as if she was drugged.""

For two years, Yucatan human rights lawyers complained without success to the governor and other officials. Then they called the human rights commission in Mexico City. On an August day in 2001, the commission arrived at the center to investigate. That day Martel quit her job and walked out the door.

A criminal investigation was later opened, but no charges have been filed.

Martel's answer to the allegations against her is unknown. Efforts to locate her were unsuccessful. Several months ago, neighbors said they saw a moving van pull up to her house, and they haven't seen her since. Officials at the state attorney general's office said they did not know where she was, and that she was being sought for questioning.

Rights workers here in Merida said the government allowed Martel to slip away to avoid the embarrassment of a messy trial with potentially nasty political implications. Mexico has a long history of looking the other way at official misconduct.

""They would rather bury this part,"" said Angulo, the UNICEF consultant. ""I think there should be a criminal trial. But I don't think there ever will be.""

Sleeping With Pigs
When Isis Maria Velazquez was 13, she recalled, her mother became exasperated with her misbehavior and turned her over to state care. She spent the next two years in Martel's facility.

The dates of her mistreatment remain etched in her memory. On July 27, 1999, she entered the center, and Martel chopped off most of her long, shiny brown hair, leaving it a short-cropped ugly nest. On May 9, 2000, she said, Martel forced her into a muddy, filthy pen where she spent the next three nights sleeping with 15 pigs.

""She shoved pig food in my face,"" Isis said. ""She was crazy.""

Her father, Lucio Jesus Velazquez, a retired night watchman, said poor people in Mexico are accustomed to being powerless. He said he paid staff at the center so he could visit Isis and tried to buy better treatment for her. He said Mexicans know they have to pay bribes to get service from the government, and that complaining often gets them nothing but more abuse.

""I don't know the laws,"" Velazquez said. ""I'm not educated in them."" He said that until a human rights lawyer told him the state had no right to treat his daughter as it did, he did not realize that what happened to her might have been illegal.

Isis said she watched as other children were beaten with rubber tubes and wooden sticks. She said some boys were tied to trees, blasted with cold water from a hose and left to sleep standing up.

Those allegations have been backed up by others who have complained to police and human rights officials, including Sylvia Zenteno Ruano, a physician hired by the state to make weekly visits to the center. She said she is still haunted by what she found one day: four boys tied to trees, rope wound around them from their necks to their knees.

""There was urine and excrement in their clothes so they must have been there for a while,"" she said. Zenteno filed a complaint with the police and waited. They did not return her call for nine months.

Isis has now been out of the center for several months. She works as a stripper in a bar called Atlantico. There, at night, she dances under a mirror ball that throws the glinting colors of the rainbow on zebra wallpaper. She said dancing helps her forget her hatred, which she described as the only thing she learned during her time in the state's hands.

""They have punished no one,"" Isis, now 16, said of the authorities. She now supports her father and they live in a tiny home in Merida with almost no furniture. ""Some of the people who beat us are still working there. They just don't care.""

""I used to have dreams,"" she said. ""But I don't anymore.""

Shelters Unregulated
A sad failure of juvenile detention centers in Mexico is that some of the imprisoned children have committed no crime. They are held because they had no home and the government could find no other bed for them.

The government operates few shelters for street children, ceding most of the responsibility to churches and other private groups. Thousands of children live in private shelters without any government supervision.

The risks of this unregulated system were recently highlighted in Puerto Vallarta, according to children's advocates, who said an American, Thomas White, started building a shelter for street children in 2000. He was allowed to do so with almost no scrutiny or investigation of his background or qualifications, they said.

""It is easier to open a shelter for children than a restaurant,"" Angulo said.

Police said they are looking for White, who has been charged with offering money and food to street children in exchange for their posing for pornographic photos and videos. He fled after a state judge issued an arrest warrant last year, and his whereabouts are unknown.

Juan Diaz Gonzalez, a Mexico City legislator, said such abuse is common. He said some shelter operators in the capital have forced children into prostitution rings or illegal adoptions. Many of the shelters are so poorly run and funded that he called them ""trash cans where kids are thrown away. The government is investing nothing in these children,"" he said. ""They are throwing away thousands of lives.""

There are new efforts to clean up the system. Since Fox came to power, top officials have been replaced, but many middle- and lower-level officials have not, particularly in the ranks of prosecutors and police. The government has little money to pay good salaries for difficult jobs, such as dealing with delinquents.

Under a new governor from Fox's National Action Party, Yucatan state officials said they plan to build a $1 million detention center. They said that only children who have committed crimes would be sent there.

They promised better record-keeping to ensure that children serve their sentences and no more. They promised that lawyers and human rights observers would be allowed access. But Yucatan, like most Mexican states, has plans and promises bigger than its pocketbook. So far, the officials have had little success in recruiting people willing to take such difficult jobs for as little as $50 a week.

Years of Life Lost
Beto had been abandoned by his parents. Living on the street was tough, he recalled, but it was nothing compared to the years of misery he suffered at the hands of the government.

""I lost a lot of my life,"" said Beto, who is now 16 and was recently released from the facility.

Beto wonders what his life would have been like had he not been forced into the state system. His manner is withdrawn and unsmiling. He seems like a serious man in a child's body. He lives with his ailing grandmother, earning a few pesos a day pedaling a bicycle taxi in a town 45 miles from here.

He doesn't like to talk about his years in Merida.

Interviewed at a taco stand in a colorful town square, Beto paused for a long time after each question, sipping on a soda. He said he was not angry, but the what-ifs nagged at him.

""If I hadn't taken those two buttons, the police wouldn't have picked me up,"" he said. ""I could have found a job and a place to live. You can't do that when you're in jail."""
88,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"Lorena Avila Suarez was 8 years old when she arrived by boat on this tiny Pacific island, coming ashore to be with her father, a convicted murderer.

She grew up among the other inmates and their children in one of the world's most unusual prisons, an island with a church, a bakery and a dance hall where convicts are allowed to serve sentences alongside their family members.

Then she fell in love with a convicted cocaine trafficker. So when her father was released a few years ago, and her mother and three sisters left with him, Avila Suarez stayed behind with her new husband. She still lives here in the prison where she has spent most of her life.

""Sometimes I would rather be on the outside. It is always the same here,"" said Avila Suarez, 25, nuzzling up to her husband, Jesus Lopez, 33, who has 18 years left to serve. ""But when I leave, I would like it to be with him.""

Isla Maria is a Mexican government prison experiment in the Pacific Ocean 95 miles south of Mazatlan. Started at the turn of the century as a Mexican version of Alcatraz, where the worst of the worst were condemned to a life of hard labor, it has been transformed into a relative paradise for inmates who have shown a willingness to reform.

Rehabilitation is a bedrock principle of the Mexican judicial system, so much so that neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment is allowed under law. Proponents say Isla Maria is a logical extension of that idea: If prisoners are going to have to return to life in a normal community one day, why not keep them in a prison that simulates a normal community?

There are no cells or bars here. The inmates are called ""colonists."" They wear no uniforms and live in ordinary housing on streets that look like those in any Mexican town. While navy officers on the perimeter of the 54-square-mile island carry machine guns, the prison guards carry no guns. About 600 children of inmates live in little houses with their parents and attend public schools on pretty, palm-lined streets.

""This prison used to be almost hell. The inmates were treated savagely and humiliated,"" said the warden, Raul Soto Calderon. Now, he said, ""If you didn't know this was a prison, you wouldn't realize it. There is nothing like this in the world.""

For one thing, it would be expensive to duplicate.

With an annual budget of $4 million for 1,600 inmates, the government pays about three times as much to handle each prisoner here as it does for those at any other prison. Transportation costs for supplies and people are high. The warden, for instance, recently had to rent a small plane to airlift a prisoner with a severe kidney problem.

Public Security Minister Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose department runs the prison, questions the wisdom of a cash-strapped government running what he calls a ""paradise."" He would like all Mexican prisons to focus on making criminals pay restitution for their crimes.

Some also question the wisdom of allowing children to grow up in prison. In several other Mexican prisons, children also live alongside their parents, usually their mothers. Although this practice is lauded for keeping families intact, it is also criticized because it means children are raised in a community of criminals, where everything from freedom to food is limited.

""For some children it can be a little damaging,"" said Oliva Suarez Ilago, Avila Suarez's mother, who now lives on a peach farm in central Mexico. ""They see things they shouldn't. They become aggressive and badly spoken.""

Avila Suarez, who does not have children, says other parents worry about having to wait for medicine that arrives on a weekly ship. ""Some children are exposed to good people on the island who say to them, 'See where I am. Learn from me,' "" she said. But other children live among ""people who don't want to change.""

Yet for some children, living here is far safer than it is in the rough neighborhoods they left behind, and the government white-washed housing is often better, too. ""I like it here because I am here with my dad,"" Maribel Cisneros, 13, said recently as she sat at her desk in a history class. ""My dad is here because of drugs.""

The inmates clearly like it here.

""When I got here I cried. What beauty!"" said Guadalupe Rodriquez Quiroz, a convicted heroin-seller who spent four years in a crowded, violent Tijuana prison before arriving here. There, she said, guards made inmates pay for everything, including use of the bathroom.

A key element of the Isla Maria experiment is to take power away from guards, who have often turned Mexican prisons into sewers of bribery and illegal punishments. Here there are only 36 guards.

Most of the inmates are at Isla Maria on drug convictions; the typical sentence here is 10 years for marijuana trafficking. But there are a few who committed robbery, assault or even murder. And the sight of Luis Oscar Mendez Juarez, who killed a man during a robbery in Mexico City, swinging on a hammock by the ocean can be a bit jarring.

The new warden said he is still weeding out the prison population. He said some of the inmates who have been sent here do not meet the island's current standards. He is in the midst of a major expansion, nearly doubling the inmate population this year to 3,000. He is also planning to order off the island any children over the age of 12.

All inmates have the option of bringing their families, but many spouses and children do not want to forfeit their jobs and routines on the mainland. For some, it is prohibitively expensive to get to Mazatlan, where a navy ship shuttles families to the island. Isla Maria has also been unable to completely shed its reputation for harsh treatment, so it has not been much in demand among the main prison population in Mexico. But word is getting out.

Avila Suarez and her husband share a one-bedroom home with a concrete floor and sparse furnishings: a double bed, a tiny television and a radio. They eat red snapper and other fresh fish caught by inmates. Their two lime-green parrots, Lino and Gustavo, fly freely about the house.

""They have never been caged,"" Lopez said.

Before being moved here, Lopez spent several years in a Guadalajara jail, where, he said, ""you are obliged to be aggressive to stay alive.""

""I would be a different person if I had to stay in Guadalajara,"" Lopez said. There he learned that ""you rob or are robbed, you defend yourself or you are beaten. Here, it is so safe you can leave your bike outside for three days and nobody would take it.""

Now the chatty Lopez is host of the island radio show, ""Window by the Sea."" He said people here ""are afraid to make mistakes because they will be forced to leave the island.""

Warden Soto Calderon said that in the nine months that he has been here, he has transferred 93 trouble-making inmates to mainland prisons. A few people have been punished for trying to ferment corn or rice to make moonshine or for smoking marijuana. Punishment is banishment to a camp on the far side of the island where there is no music, television or family life. In the old days, it used to be splitting rocks in the hot sun.

Suarez Ilago, Avila Suarez's mother, said there were many good things about Isla Maria. Her husband, who killed a man in a street brawl, had no formal schooling when he arrived, but spent his years on the island finishing primary school and learning to work a farm.

She said he now works hard on their little peach farm, no longer drinks and has had no more troubles with the law.

Despite the rehabilitative effect Isla Maria had on her husband, Suarez Ilago said, ""I never forgot for a moment that I was in jail."" During the decade she spent on the island with her four daughters, she would look out at the endless ocean and see it as invisible bars.

""I feel bad that I brought her to the island and then left her there,"" she said about her one daughter still in the penal colony. ""It was like leaving half of my heart there.""

But Avila Suarez said she does not feel like someone left behind. She has a job as a telephone operator, takes occasional vacations and lives what she considers a normal life. She said she misses the little comforts that the mainland provides, like variety of food, the sight of a mountain or a highway, the latest magazines.

But more important to her are the good times, and the lifetime of memories here. Nearly everyone on the island came to her wedding ceremony seven years ago. She was just 18, stepping lightly into marriage and adulthood in a prison dining hall with an inmate band playing salsa."
89,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"The Little Mouse yearned to be free.

So after three months in prison, Julio Cesar Lara, a 100-pound burglar known as Little Mouse, took his chance one night. With the speed and agility that had earned him his nickname, he slipped past his guards, crawled through the shadows, scurried over a high wall on a makeshift rope and suddenly found himself a free man.

It was three weeks before the police caught up with him. But in the eyes of the Mexican legal system, he had done nothing wrong. Escaping from prison is not a crime in Mexico. ""The law says that all inmates have the right to seek their freedom,"" said Lara, 27, who is serving three years for burglary but not a single extra day for his jailbreak. ""The opportunity presented itself, and I took it.""

Mexico's legal system recognizes that all people have a fundamental desire to be free. And it does not punish them for pursuing it, as some inmates recently did by disguising themselves as female visitors and tunneling to freedom using a sardine can as a shovel.

Critics of the law call it one more weakness in a judicial system that is holding back Mexico's efforts to modernize. But those who support the law describe it as a humanitarian measure that respects human dignity.

""The person who tries to escape is seeking liberty, and that is deeply respected in the law,"" Juventino Victor Castro y Castro, a Supreme Court justice, said in an interview. ""The basic desire for freedom is implicit inside every man, so trying to escape cannot be considered a crime.""

The same philosophy respects the right to run from the police to avoid capture, said Jose Elias Romero Apis, a lawyer and federal legislator. Likewise, he said, it is not considered perjury in Mexico for people to lie about their guilt on the witness stand.

""It is part of an entire philosophy; the accused is permitted to struggle however he can for his freedom,"" said Romero, president of the Justice and Human Rights Committee in the lower house of Congress. ""Freedom is given priority over other values, including prison security.""

There are, however, a few escape clauses. While escaping is legal, prisoners can be charged if they break laws in the process. If they injure someone on the way out, conspire with other prisoners to escape, bribe someone or damage property, they can be charged. But if, like Lara, they simply figure out a way to hop a wall or sneak out a door, they have committed no crime.

""It's an extraordinary law, a charitable and spiritual law,"" said Sister Antonia, an American Catholic nun who has lived and worked in a Tijuana prison for 25 years. ""Every person in their heart yearns to be free.""

Some said the get-out-of-jail-free law gives prisoners a chance to get even with an unfair justice system. Mexican prisons are clogged with petty criminals, while bankers and politicians accused of stealing millions stay free. Many said the escape law gives the common man one last shot at beating the system.

""There are a lot of people in jail who shouldn't be,"" said Javier Reyes, 38, a city public works employee. He said the justice system is especially harsh on the poor and he didn't object to them escaping. ""This is a result of the unfairness of the system.""

But others said the law, which dates to the 1930s, sends the wrong message, especially at a time when opinion polls show crime is the Mexican public's No. 1 concern. ""It's absurd,"" said Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico City's police chief. ""The prisoner is a danger to society if he leaves prison. You cannot value the right of one person over the rights of all the others.""

Alejandro Gertz Manero, top public security official in President Vicente Fox's government, called the escape law ""nonsense,"" and said he would like to see it changed. He said officials are working on several proposed changes to the federal criminal code. But Congress would have to approve them, and Fox has had limited success persuading the opposition-controlled legislature to pass his initiatives.

Since his election in 2000, Fox has spent time and money trying to bring Mexico's chaotic prisons under control. When he took office, it was not uncommon for wealthy inmates to buy ""weekend passes"" to go home for parties. Some built Jacuzzis and tequila bars in their cells. But recently many of those cells have been dismantled, hundreds of corrupt guards have been fired and new surveillance equipment has been installed.

But that has not stopped prisoners from digging and climbing out of prisons -- or just walking out the front door. There are no reliable statistics on escapes, but dozens are reported in the press every year.

Last month, a prisoner walked out of a prison in the state of Jalisco by showing the guards a fake ID brought by a visitor. Also last month here in Mexico City, a convicted murderer in Reclusorio Sur, the prison from which Lara escaped, sneaked out of a prison hospital where he was being treated for a toothache. Still handcuffed, he flagged down a taxi and rode away.

One of the most famous escape artists here, known as ""El Tarzan,"" made big headlines last December by sashaying out of Mexico City's Reclusorio Oriente dressed as a woman in a wig and a dress.

One of the most audacious was a convicted murderer whose wife carried him out of Mexico City's Reclusorio Norte in 1998 in a suitcase she used to lug home his dirty laundry. Prison officials said he dieted until he weighed 110 pounds so he would fit. His nickname before the escape was ""The Bullet Eater,"" but he is now referred to in the local press as ""El Samsonite.""

He was found nine months later working in a store in Guadalajara and brought back to prison. He escaped again not long afterward and is still free.

The most infamous recent escape was that of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, one of Mexico's most notorious drug lords, who escaped from the maximum-security Puente Grande prison in Jalisco state in January 2001. Guzman bribed guards and prison officials, about 60 of whom are currently on trial. He rode out of prison hidden in a laundry truck and has not been seen since.

If he is found, he will have to finish his 20-year sentence and face bribery charges. But the escape itself will earn him only the admiration of his peers, which is what Lara said he has had since he hopped the wall.

""I'm a hero to the guys who wear beige"" prison uniforms, Lara said during an interview in the office of the prison warden, who jokingly calls him ""our Spiderman.""

Lara said he feels lucky to be alive. Escaping may not be a crime, but prison guards are allowed to shoot and kill anyone trying to escape. Lara dodged a shower of bullets fired by guards who chased him into cornfields.

He has less than two years left on his sentence and said he's looking forward to getting back to running the hamburger stand he operated before. When asked whether he would ever try to escape again, a broad grin crossed his face.

""It depends,"" he said."
90,WP,Sullivan,2003,Mexico Justice System,"The pilgrims began arriving before dawn, with hope in their hearts and folders in their hands. They wanted jobs, pensions, favors, loans. They stood in line for hours, even when the rain came slashing down sideways, waiting outside a fancy stone house to plead their case to the man with the power: Ramon Hernandez Toledo.

""Uncle Ramon,"" as he is known to all here, is the local union boss of Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the national oil monopoly and one of the world's largest producers of crude oil. With annual sales of nearly $50 billion, Pemex accounts for about a third of government revenue in Mexico. That makes its 117,000-member union the most powerful in the country. And as boss of the union's largest chapter, Hernandez's word is law in this town built on oil.

""If he doesn't say so, we don't get it,"" said Alfredo Canepa Martinez, 63, a retired union worker. ""If he says the wind shouldn't blow, the wind doesn't blow.""

In Nanchital, 400 miles east of Mexico City near the Gulf of Mexico, Hernandez directly controls the lives of more than 13,000 union workers, from chemists to truck drivers. They cannot hold their jobs, get a promotion, take a vacation or earn retirement benefits without his blessing.

His influence is everywhere. Children in this town of 28,000 grow up studying in schools and playing in parks paid for by the union and worshiping in a church built by the union. They eat food bought at union-owned grocery stores, take medicine bought at the union-owned pharmacy and, more often than not, eventually become union workers themselves. When people need a loan, they often turn not to banks but to the union. When they die, the union-owned funeral home sends them on their way.

But the few people here who dare criticize Hernandez say his power is corrupt, and describe him as a sort of shadow emperor. Angry oil workers allege that he has stolen millions of dollars, draining union coffers to become wealthy and fund political campaigns. They say he benefits from Mexico's weak system of justice, under which those with the right political connections are accountable to no one.

Critics say Hernandez is the true power in town hall, which the union built. Many people interviewed here said the mayor, a union member, could not have been elected without Hernandez's say-so and could not govern without his largesse. When the mayor needs a new road or school or garbage truck, he said he often asks Hernandez for the money or the land.

Alberto Olvera, a professor at the University of Veracruz who studies the union, said Hernandez's influence extends to the justice system. Oil workers angry at Hernandez said they don't bother complaining to local prosecutors and judges, because justice officials work in a building owned by the union and aren't about to rule against their landlord.

""He has the power to influence the decisions of judges, so the judicial power is unable to have autonomy,"" Olvera said. ""You are looking at a place where the past is still alive.""

There are hundreds of local strongmen like Hernandez across Mexico, according to human rights groups and academics. Some are union leaders, some own large amounts of land, some are simply well-connected thugs. What they have in common is that they are the de facto government and law for tens of thousands of people. They pass out favors to friends and punish enemies, protected by a system that thrived during seven decades of authoritarian, one-party rule in Mexico.

""It's like a medieval royal court where the king sits there, people line up to see him, and he makes all the decisions,"" said historian Lorenzo Meyer of the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City.

President Vicente Fox, elected two years ago after campaigning against corruption, is trying to establish a justice system based on laws, not on the arbitrary decisions of powerful individuals. But local bosses remain a powerful obstacle to those efforts.

As federal authorities try to tear down old castles of corruption, the most explosive scandal is known as Pemexgate. The government alleges that $170 million in Pemex money was illegally diverted to political purposes. They are investigating Pemex and union leaders, including Hernandez, for allegedly shoveling money to Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for its unsuccessful 2000 presidential campaign.

During the PRI's 71-year rule of Mexico, which ended with Fox's election, it used Pemex as its not-so-secret piggy bank, Meyer said. He said it skimmed off vast amounts of oil money for campaigns and favors, and the looting of Pemex became part of the political culture. Many here say that is a key reason a country with such vast oil resources can't adequately feed and educate its people, more than half of whom live in poverty.

Oil workers have also filed federal complaints alleging that Hernandez has siphoned off money from a union bus transportation business. They claim he has bought houses and cars and enriched himself with funds that should have gone to workers' housing, loans and pensions.

Hernandez declined repeated requests for an interview for this article. A local union spokesman said Hernandez ordered the union to provide ""no help"" to reporters. A spokesman for the national union said Hernandez and the other union leaders accused in Pemexgate have done nothing illegal, and he accused Fox of conducting a ""political witch hunt."" Officials from Pemex, Mexico's largest company, declined to comment.

On the streets of Nanchital, many people interviewed said they were only vaguely aware of the allegations against Hernandez, which have gone mostly unreported in the local press.

""He buys reporters,"" said Jorge Caceres, who covers the union for a local newspaper. Caceres said the union helps pay reporters' long-distance phone bills at a union-run press room, and Hernandez has handed checks for as much as $600 to reporters who earn as little as $2 a story. Caceres said he had never taken Hernandez's money but knows many reporters who have. ""You don't have freedom of expression,"" he said, ""if you cannot criticize the person who is giving you money.""

Workers here who have created a dissident wing of the union to protest what they see as its abuses say that Hernandez laughs at efforts to hold him accountable while, they say, looting the union for himself and the PRI.

""He does whatever he wants with the money, and nobody can touch him,"" Canepa, the retired oil worker, said. ""People tolerate it and don't demand their rights because they are afraid. If they did, they would get no loans, no raises, no jobs. We're in a circle that we can't get out of.""

Awash in Wealth
The union's local chapter receives millions of dollars in annual dues, as well as fees paid by Pemex and profits from union-owned businesses. Hernandez has no legal obligation to tell rank-and-file members how he spends it. By tradition, powerful union bosses have no check on their authority to spend union funds as they please.

""You simply cannot imagine how much money he has,"" said Elda Luz Palma Martinez, who worked with Hernandez in the union's leadership for five years in the 1990s. Speaking in her small home here, with a concrete floor and few furnishings, Palma said Hernandez forced her out for questioning his financial dealings.

Palma said she saw Hernandez regularly hand union money to PRI candidates. She said other money simply went missing. ""He lives totally above the law,"" she said.

Federal Authorities investigating Hernandez have not filed any charges against him. PRI officials are openly discussing plans to place him in the national Congress next year, where he would be immune from prosecution.

Many here say Hernandez is one of Mexico's many ""untouchables."" Martin Aguilar, a researcher at the University of Veracruz, said most workers are afraid to criticize him. Others, he said, are so accustomed his power that they see nothing wrong with it. ""Corruption is tolerated as long as the union provides them with jobs, schools, health care and other benefits,"" Aguilar said.

It's a balance that has long existed here. Hernandez's predecessor, Francisco ""Chico"" Balderas, spent millions of dollars on the town. People here say he too was corrupt, but that he was also beloved because of his generosity.

Union leaders used to be even more powerful, said Arturo Alcalde, a labor lawyer in Mexico City. After major oil deposits were discovered in Mexico in the 1970s, union bosses were so strong that they controlled even the most intimate corners of everyday life: They arranged marriages, named babies and decided on punishments for cheating husbands.

Old-style bosses silenced dissent by bashing heads, Alcalde said. Today, he said, they are just as nefarious, but more subtle: They keep people loyal by providing jobs and benefits, smiling to their faces while stealing behind their backs. ""They are just like the Mafia,"" he said. ""They offer people protection, and they are corrupt.""

When Balderas died in 1991, Hernandez won a power struggle and was elected to lead the union. Analysts said it has been under his control since, despite his stints in other positions, including Congress, when one of his loyalists nominally served as union head.

Julio Cesar Rodriguez, a leader of dissidents who claim 500 workers locally and 9,000 nationwide, said workers are suffering. He said corruption within the union had robbed workers of money that should be used for loans for homes or to send their children to college. And he said it should have been used to improve the town where they live.

Rodriguez said Nanchital was once a ""model city,"" but that since Hernandez took over, it has steadily deteriorated. The postcard-pretty town square is filled with teenagers eating tacos from a stand in the red-tile-roofed gazebo or using computers at the ""American Internet"" cafe. But just a few blocks away, the roads are poorly paved, and many houses are crumbling. Workers complain that their salaries have not kept up with inflation, and Hernandez is stingy with home loans that were once plentiful. Rodriguez said many workers can't afford to buy houses that the union built for them.

Mayor Ricardo Castelo Castillo said Hernandez has spent less on the town than his predecessor did, but only because the union has less money now. But even Castelo, one of Hernandez's closest allies, paused when asked if Hernandez had stolen workers' money. ""I don't want to say that he steals or he doesn't steal money,"" he said. ""I don't know about that.""

Rodriguez said oil workers see the obvious when they look around their worn-down town.

""If the benefits that Pemex gives to the union for the workers actually reached them, the workers would live better,"" he said. ""But the benefits don't arrive. The only one who benefits is Hernandez. If there were an honest use of the money, the streets of Nanchital would be paved with gold.""

Centuries of Strongmen
The system of local bosses, who are known as caciques, was introduced by the Spanish conquistadors 500 years ago as a way for a relatively small number of Spaniards to control many Mexicans. When the PRI was created after the Mexican Revolution, in the early 20th century, its leaders realized that the local strongmen could be as useful to them as they had been to the Spanish, said Meyer, the historian.

These people helped build the PRI into the 20th century's longest-running political machine. The PRI gave caciques government money, and they handed out milk for babies, seed for corn fields, cash for school pencils. In exchange, recipients were counted as automatic votes for the PRI. The disloyal were cut off from perks and jobs, and, in some cases, punished violently.

Although the party was defeated by Fox, the PRI system survives in many areas. The PRI still controls half the nation's governorships and mayors and the leadership of many unions.

The long-standing connections between the former ruling party, the oil monopoly and the union endure. Hernandez is president of the PRI in Coatzacoalcos, the nearby oil town where he lives. He also sits on Pemex's 11-member board, a group that includes four of Fox's cabinet members.

Despite the investigations, Hernandez moves about as he always has. He rides in his chauffeur-driven Chevrolet Suburban to the popular restaurant his family owns, to the PRI offices and to union headquarters.

And every morning, crowds looking for favors line up at his home in his expensive neighborhood.

One recent morning, Adela Hernandez waited like a sad statue beneath her umbrella, her bright blue dress and thin shoes soaked through. Her husband, an oil worker, died five years ago, and his pension payments suddenly stopped. With her money running out, she said she is desperate.

So the 62-year-old widow, who is no relation to the union boss, has come here twice a week for two years, lining up with the others to plead her case to Hernandez as he leaves his house in the morning.

""I know he is going to help me,"" she said. If Hernandez didn't restore her only source of income, however, she said she had nowhere else to turn -- no one else has the power to help her.

At about 8 a.m., a guard told her and a dozen others waiting in the rain that the boss would be out soon. One young woman, who declined to give her name, said her father was retiring from Pemex, and she wanted to inherit his union job and become a Pemex accountant. Under union rules, jobs can be passed to a relative -- but only if Hernandez approves.

""It's so hard to see him at the union office,"" she said, as the sun rose over Hernandez's house, outfitted with Christmas lights and surveillance cameras. ""He's so busy with all the things he's in charge of. It's easier to come here. But now we just have to wait until he wakes up.""

Asked if she was bothered by allegations against Hernandez, she looked surprised. ""No,"" she said. ""The señor helps us a lot. If we need something, he gives it to us.""

Hernandez's chauffeur pulled up. He ran past the waiting workers through the puddles, carrying a package of soft, hot tortillas for his boss's breakfast. That was a good sign, everyone agreed, because Hernandez usually comes out right after he eats. They know his every move, like well-informed students of the local monarchy.

An hour later, however, Hernandez's wife appeared with a bodyguard holding her umbrella. As she stepped into her car, she told the crowd that her husband wouldn't be granting any audiences that morning."
91,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"The melancholy wail sailed across the city and pierced the walls of the middle-class Baghdad home. The sleepless family listened in silence until the mother, her face lined with fear and pain, shook her head.

""Siren,"" she whispered.

At that, her daughter jumped up and threw open the door. She ran to open the windows next, fearful the blast would shatter them. The son sprinted outside, hoping to spot a low-flying cruise missile that would send the family huddling, yet again, in a hallway.

And they waited for the bombs.

""It's terrible,"" the mother said, as the minutes passed. ""We really suffer, and I don't know why we should live like this.""

Her daughter nodded. ""I get so scared, I shake,"" she said. ""I'm afraid the house is going to collapse on my head.""

While the outside world has grown accustomed to detached images of fire and fury over Baghdad, and the government here boasts of victory over the invaders, this rattled family of five in the middle-class neighborhood of Jihad has watched war turn life upside down. Their world now is isolation, dread and a bitter sense that they do not deserve their fate.

""We're in a dark, dark tunnel, and we don't see the light at the end of it,"" the daughter-in-law said.

The family met privately with a journalist today, without the presence of a requisite government escort and with a promise that their identities would not be published. Over a lunch of Iraqi dishes -- pickled mango, kibbe, kufta and chicken cooked with rice, peanuts and raisins -- they spoke with unusual candor about politics and war. At times brashly, they discussed subjects that are usually hinted at, as if Baghdad were already in limbo between its past and its future.

""Iraq is ready for change,"" the father said. ""The people want it; they want more freedom.""

But family members expressed anger at the U.S. government, which has promised to liberate them. They criticized President Saddam Hussein and his dictatorial rule, but insisted that pride and patriotism prevent them from putting their destiny in the hands of a foreign power.

They spoke most fervently of a longing for routine -- the most mundane rituals of going to work, sharing dinner on a quiet night and sleeping at a set hour. They predicted little of that stability ahead. From a bloody battle for the capital, to lawlessness, to the humiliation of an occupation, they braced for a future that hardly anyone in Baghdad dares predict.

""Everything is turned around,"" the daughter-in-law said.

For weeks, the daughter-in-law helped prepare the house for war. She and her husband hauled a mattress downstairs, setting up their bedroom in the dining room. The family rearranged furniture so that they could sprint to open the windows. Sofas and tables were cloaked in dust cloths to protect them from flying glass and debris. Two rifles and bags of ammunition were propped against the wall.

Scattered around the two-story house were supplies to help them withstand a siege. Two tanks were filled with kerosene for cooking in case the electricity went out. The mother filled every pan, kettle and thermos with water, in case the pumps stopped working. Flour, sugar, rice, beans, powdered milk, biscuits, jam, cheese, macaroni, wheat, and cereal filled bag after bag.

""These will last three months,"" the son said, surveying the stockpile.

His wife interrupted to disagree. One month, no more. ""The men in our family have very big appetites,"" she said.

It was a rare moment of levity in a city with little joy. The family members gazed out the window at a sky shrouded in black smoke from fires lit by Iraqi forces to conceal targets from U.S. strikes. The oil pits burned for a second day, turning a sunny, cloudless Baghdad sky into an eerie gauze. In vain, the family hoped the smoke would limit the air assault.

They had already had enough, they said. The worst so far was Friday, when U.S. and British forces fired 320 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Baghdad, wrecking the symbols of Hussein's rule. Ten of the missiles landed near their home, shattering the window in the front of the house. The shock waves threw open the refrigerator, tossing its drawers on the kitchen floor.

""They were powerful, really powerful,"" the mother said. ""They came one after another.""

Baghdad is a city that takes pride in its toughness. Residents are fond of listing the challenges history has thrown before them. The men in the family sounded a similar theme.

""We have 11,000 years of history. I know it sounds facetious, but it gives you resilience,"" the father said.

Of the bombs, his son added, ""The bark is worse than the bite."" But in private moments today, the suffering was close to the surface. Friends, they said, had fled to Syria in January, only to run out of money before the war started. Others had headed north to the city of Mosul, hoping to endure the war with relatives.

Those who stayed have struggled to negotiate the uncertainty. A pregnant friend of the daughter-in-law was supposed to have a Caesarean section within 10 days. But her doctor has vanished. Hospital after hospital has refused to admit her, overwhelmed with the task of preparing for the wounded. Another friend who is seven months pregnant has begun taking valium.

A neighbor said she stuffed cotton in the ears of her two young children every night. She fretted about finding diapers and milk.

""She's in a complete panic,"" the daughter-in-law said.

When it came to the cause of Iraq's predicament, family members pointed to Hussein, describing him as rash. He invaded Iran, trapping them in an eight-year war. He seized Kuwait, bringing on the Persian Gulf War and the devastation of sanctions that largely wiped out Iraq's middle class. After that war, they were ready to overthrow him themselves.

But they bitterly denounced the war the United States has launched. Iraq, perhaps more than any other Arab country, dwells on traditions -- of pride, honor and dignity. To this family, the assault is an insult. It is not Hussein under attack, but Iraq, they said. It is hard to gauge if this is a common sentiment, although it is one heard more often as the war progresses.

""We complain about things, but complaining doesn't mean cooperating with foreign governments,"" the father said. ""When somebody comes to attack Iraq, we stand up for Iraq. That doesn't mean we love Saddam Hussein, but there are priorities.""

A friend of the family interrupted. ""Bombing for peace?"" he asked, shaking his head.

""I don't even care about the leadership,"" the daughter-in-law said. ""But someone wants to take away what is yours. What gives them the right to change something that's not theirs in the first place? I don't like your house, so I'm going to bomb it and you can rebuild it again the way I want it, with your money? I feel like it's an insult, really.""

Gathered around the table, the family members nodded their heads.

""There are rumblings of dissent,"" the father said. ""But these rumblings don't mean: Come America, we'll throw flowers at you.""

The family is Sunni Muslim, a minority from which the government draws its strength. Sunnis appear to have the most to lose in a postwar Iraq that would undoubtedly devolve authority to Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslim majority in the south. The son acknowledged that some Shiite friends had a different opinion of the U.S. attack. But Iraqi nationalism -- and a history replete with sometimes violent opposition to foreign intervention -- could influence the course of the war and its aftermath.

On this day, though, survival was the more pressing issue. By late afternoon, the thunder of bombing broke across the horizon. The son said he heard a rumor that B-52s were on their way, and the family members guessed at the time it would take them to arrive.

They were jittery, flinching at the slightest sounds. ""That's wind, that's wind,"" the father said when the door slammed shut. When the son got up, his chair banged the wall and the mother jumped. A few minutes later, he did it again.

""Quit doing that,"" his mother said. ""I'm so scared. Every little noise.""

Outside, the sounds of ordinary life came from the street. A cart passed the house, its horn blowing. It had come to collect trash and refill kerosene tanks for cooking. As the cart passed, the routine it evoked seemed to anger the son.

""I should be able to live like other people are living,"" he said glumly. ""I shouldn't fear bombs falling on my head, I shouldn't be hearing sirens. Why should I have to like this? Why should this be normal?""

Everyone looked to the floor, no one saying a word."
92,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion," Shards of corrugated tin dangled from roofs like chimes, colliding on the winds of a savage sandstorm. Shattered pipes poured sewage into the streets. The charred carcasses of cars sat smoldering, hurled onto the sidewalk.

Ali Abdel-Jabbar watched helplessly as his friend, Mohammed Abdel-Sattar, lay on the ground, his legs torn off. He lived. Across the street was the severed hand of Samad Rabai, tossed gracelessly in a pool of blood and mud. He died.

In a moment, two explosions transformed a busy stretch of life today into a junkyard of mangled wires, uprooted trees, toppled lights, anguish and grief.

Iraqi officials said at least 14 people were killed and 30 injured in the blasts -- a count that matched hospital estimates -- in the biggest loss of civilian life in Baghdad since U.S. and British air attacks began last week. The explosions devastated a 100-yard swath of shops, homes and a restaurant in the working-class neighborhood of Shaab, on Baghdad's northern outskirts.

Pentagon officials denied responsibility for the bombing, saying there were no U.S. targets near the neighborhood. But U.S. military officials in Qatar said that U.S. aircraft targeting Iraqi surface-to-air missile launchers in a residential area in Baghdad had fired precision-guided weapons at about the same time as the bombing, possibly causing civilian damage.

In the Shaab neighborhood, the carnage spoke of the helplessness and dread that has enveloped the capital.

""Who accepts this?"" shouted George Said, a mechanic whose store was littered with spilled oil, a door torn from its hinges onto the floor. ""Does America like this, does Bush like this, do the American people like this? How can they accept the destruction?""

Crowds poured into the muddy, congested streets, shouting, ""We will sacrifice our blood and souls for you, Saddam.""

But in private, some residents complained bitterly that the Iraqi military had trucked missiles and other weapons to a grass-and-mud clearing at the neighborhood's edge. One neighbor said the trucks moved in from 11 p.m. to dawn, their movements shrouded to a degree by a two-day sandstorm that Iraqis said was the fiercest in years. Four tents and military equipment remained there today, concealed in part by trenches and dozens of industrial-size spools for cable. Down the road were at least four antiaircraft guns.

The neighbor said he blamed ""both sides"" for the destruction that sent shattered glass cascading through his apartment. His refrigerator and television rested against the pockmarked wall, tossed across the room by the force of the blast. Flying debris injured his mother, father, brother and sister, all of whom lived together in a cramped, two-room apartment.

""We are the simple people who get hurt. The government doesn't get hurt, but we end up getting hurt,"" the 35-year-old resident said. The government ""is responsible for the people. They should take care of the people.""

It was a day of menace in Baghdad, a capital forced to contend with around-the-clock bombing, smoke billowing from burning oil trenches that has compelled some to flee, and a sandstorm that has convinced many that divine intervention rules their fate.

On the storm's second day, the city of more than 5 million was coated in a film of dust, blown in from Iraq's deserts. The sky turned from a blinding yellow at dawn to blood-red in the afternoon. A dusk-like brown was followed by an eerie orange at nightfall. An occasional vegetable stand provided the city's few glimpses of color in its onions, tomatoes, eggplant and oranges. Rain fell throughout the day, bathing Baghdad in mud.

Cars drove with their headlights on at noon, and street lights cast a faint glow over the city streets. Residents complained of sleeplessness, some saying they had started taking Valium to ease the anxiety brought by the storms and the bombing. Few in the capital predicted that the worst was over; even fewer were willing to predict what the next few weeks would bring.

Shaab today was their worst fears made plain.

U.S. forces have, on the whole, waged their air assault on Baghdad with precision, targeting presidential palaces, government offices and intelligence headquarters since last week. At dawn, blasts shook the area that houses the Information Ministry, knocking Iraqi television off the air for several hours. But there have been errant strikes too, demolishing a student union building at Mustansiriya University, a laundry in a village outside Baghdad and clusters of homes in the neighborhoods of Adhimiya and Qadisiya.

In Shaab, the bombs struck at 11:30 a.m., a time that the streets, even in war, were crowded with mechanics, vendors of auto spare parts, customers at electric appliance stores and families sitting down to a late breakfast after a jarring night of bombing.

Residents said they heard the murmur of a bomber in a cloaked sky. Seconds later, the first explosion struck.

Abdel-Jabbar was in his workshop, putting together cardboard boxes. The blast collapsed the shop's entrance, showering the store with bricks and cinderblocks. He said the shock waves tossed cars and people several feet. One of them was Sattar, a 22-year-old friend repairing his car in the street. Sattar survived, Abdel-Jabbar said, but his legs were severed.

""Does he carry weapons of mass destruction?"" Abdel-Jabbar shouted, as the sirens of ambulances, police cars and civil defense vehicles tried, in vain, to navigate traffic that had come to a standstill in the wrecked street. ""Do his wife and children carry weapons of mass destruction?""

Next door, two workers had been scurrying around the Dulaimi Restaurant, preparing for lunchtime. Both were killed in an instant. The restaurant's red and blue tiles lay splintered on the sidewalk, plastic white tables and chairs were turned upside down, wires hung from the ceiling like a spider's web and its sign dangled overhead, giving perch to a bird.

Within moments, the second blast struck the other side of the street. Qais Sabah and his family of eight were sitting down to a breakfast of falafel, boiled eggs and bread. They jumped at the first explosion, then were thrown to the ground by the second.

Hours later, the 35-year-old day laborer looked out over the detritus of his house. A cracked porcelain plate that read ""God"" hung askew on the wall. On the sidewalk outside was the severed hand of Samad Rabai, 17, the owner of an appliance store.

""It's a crime against us,"" Sabah said. ""There's nothing here to bomb.""

Tareq Abdullah was making a halfhearted attempt to wash the dust off his white Lada sedan when the bombs struck. He was thrown several feet, then crawled to his car. He said he was desperate. His 4-year-old son, Ali, was still inside, screaming.

In the hospital, Abdullah lay in a bed with bandages covering wounds to his head, chest and both legs from flying debris. He had trouble hearing, his ears still ringing from the bomb's percussion. ""I feel pain,"" he said, over and over.

Next to him, his brother Ahmed, wearing a soccer jersey smeared with dried blood, looked at the bed and started crying.

""Look at my brother,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Look at my friends.""

In another room, Alawi, the nickname given to young Ali by his relatives, lay in a bed with a bandage over his head. With deep brown eyes and the look of a young child struggling to make sense of disaster, he said the Americans were trying to kill his father. He pulled nervously on the threads of the blue-and-white blanket covering the cut on his shoulder, recounting his fear.

""But I'm not afraid anymore. I'm brave,"" he said meekly.

Hours after the attack, residents piled trucks with their belongings. One patriarch threw mattresses, red and pink blankets and pillows off a ledge to his children below, careful to keep their few belongings out of the mud and sewage. Another man carted a refrigerator, chairs, shelves and blue bedding in a pile along the street. Workers emptied a workshop of battered machinery, then slapped mortar on cinderblocks to build a wall across its door.

""We'll clean up,"" Sabah said. ""We'll find our relatives. We have to go somewhere else. We have no place left."""
93,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"The bombs crashed that morning on Baghdad, declaring war. At nightfall, Karima, a mother of eight, took her eldest son to the bus station, sending him off to fight in the north.

Their farewell was infused with the deeply religious idiom of Arabic, phrases at once formal and personal. ""God be with you,"" she remembered saying, as her 20-year-old son boarded the rickety red bus for Mosul, a 30-cent fare in his hand. ""God protect you.""

Those words, spoken a week ago, were their last.

Her son, a tall, gaunt soldier known for his generosity, traveled five hours to man an antiaircraft battery in Bartalah, about 25 miles north of Mosul. She returned to her three-room apartment, tears running down her face, under a black veil.

""A mother's heart rests on her son's heart,"" she said. ""Every hour, I cry for him.""

In a city scarred on its surface by bombing and deep in its psyche by years of hardship, a week-old war is only her latest tragedy. The story of Karima is perhaps most remarkable for how unexceptional it is.

A short woman with worn hands, she has no money, no work other than selling chewing gum from a canvas mat in the street, and the dearth of hope that forces so many in this once-proud city to put their faith and future in God's hands.

Speaking to a journalist, without the presence of a government escort, Karima expressed sentiments in Baghdad today that seemed confusing, even contradictory. Yet they remain common, coloring the Iraqi capital as it enters its second week of war.

She is a Shiite Muslim in a land ruled by a relentlessly repressive government dominated by Sunni Muslims. She takes pride in her son's service in the army, but deems the war a waste and waits for news she hopes will never come. Her five daughters reflexively break into a chant in support of President Saddam Hussein, perhaps more out of fear than fealty. In more reflective moments, they speak not of defending his government, but of protecting their homes, their country and their faith from a war they consider an invasion.

Most telling are their priorities. They speak not of politics, not of ideology, but of survival.

""God willing, the war won't last long,"" Karima said. ""I wish it wouldn't have lasted one day.""

Sitting on mats lined against the wall, her daughters -- age 16, 15, 13, 12 and 11 -- giggled, awkward in the presence of a foreigner. Overhead was a portrait of the prophet Muhammad's grandson Hussein, a resonant symbol of suffering in Shiite theology. Hanging over a battered refrigerator, its white paint peeling and its rusted handle broken, was a porcelain blue plate that read ""God.""

""This war is such a loss,"" the mother whispered.

Karima's life has been a chain of tragedies, but she has proved resilient. Her husband died eight years ago. A driver for a Japanese company in Baghdad, he was killed in a wreck when another car's brakes malfunctioned. She lost her job as a maid when the Lebanese doctor she worked for left Iraq two years ago.

In January, she was evicted from her home, a garage in which the family had pirated running water and electricity. Her eldest son, the breadwinner, joined the army a year and a half ago. Another son, 18, got on the wrong side of the law and served five months in jail for stealing a car. She said the youngest son, 9, is too young to work.

She managed to find another apartment in a run-down building, wires hanging from the ceiling and tattered furniture stacked in the dilapidated hallways. But her rent is about $18 a month, a sum she has no chance of paying. She expects to be evicted again soon.

Now, she said, she is coping with war, and the dread it has brought. At first, many of her friends and relatives -- those with enough money -- fled the city. Her sister-in-law put only her children in a car for Syria, leaving everything else behind. ""Whoever could, left,"" she said. ""Whoever couldn't is sitting in their houses.""

Then she dealt with spiraling prices, as residents made a run on stores to stock up on bottled water, rice, flour and beans, kerosene for cooking, and gas for their cars. A tray of 24 eggs went from 50 cents to $1.40. The price of slightly more than two pounds of potatoes -- a favorite for war-weary Baghdad because of their shelf life -- jumped more than three times in a week.

And then there's the seclusion. Schools were canceled three days before the war started, making Karima's children go stir-crazy in the suffocating confines of three rooms.

Karima said she was terrified of the bombing and afraid to go outside. When the explosions send shudders through their shoddily constructed building, she and her children run into the stairwell, joining another family huddled in darkness.

""We don't know what will happen. We don't know when it will happen,"" she said. ""There's no life, there's no death. Only tension.""

At night, they try to pick up the Arabic-language service of Radio Monte Carlo to hear what they consider unbiased reports on the war -- straining to hear the names of Umm Qasr, Nasiriyah, Basra and Najaf. In silence, they listen for any detail on fighting in the north, where the eldest son is stationed.

When the war started, he had been at home. For one week each month, soldiers get leave, and he was spending his week here, working as a plumber. Karima said he hesitated only briefly to rejoin his unit.

""He wasn't scared,"" one daughter insisted.

Her mother shot her a look of disapproval. ""Of course, he was scared. He's anxious. And we're anxious for him. But God is present.""

Her other son picked up a gun, as well. He was released in an amnesty ordered by Hussein in October that emptied Iraq's jails of their prisoners. A ne'er-do-well, even by the accounts of his family, he joined the motley crowd of militiamen patrolling Baghdad's streets. In street clothes and carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle, he looks after an antiaircraft gun parked in front of a school.

The family's view: He's looking for a fight.

In conversations in Baghdad -- always framed by the lurking menace of an omnipresent police state -- the conflict is rarely if ever talked about in terms of liberation. Those sentiments may exist, cloaked in the silence that talk of politics here provokes. But far more dominant, even in private, is a view that the war is imposed on people against their will, an intervention they resent.

Karima's Shiite family was no different. They spoke not of freedom, but of defending their faith.

The mention of liberation prompted them to shake their heads. They seemed angry, even bewildered, by a conflict that has left them guessing uneasily as to its outcome.

""The United States is strong,"" she said, nodding her head. ""But God willing, we'll be stronger. We have right on our side. They attacked us. We didn't attack them. They have weapons, but we have God.""

Her daughter, a vivacious girl of 13, joined in. ""If you were sitting in your house and somebody attacks you, would you accept that? We won't accept somebody coming into our country. We'll defend our country, and we'll defend our home.""

Of Iraq's many aggrieved parties, Shiite Muslims, the majority in Iraq, have perhaps suffered the most. Through three decades of Baath Party rule, they have endured bloody crackdowns, the forced exile of tens of thousands to neighboring Iran and the underdevelopment of the southern region where they predominate. The government has executed their religious leaders and, at times, publicly questioned their loyalty, given the community's historic ties to Shiite Iran.

Beyond the tired rhetoric in support of the Iraqi president, Karima's family had little to say about Hussein, whose visage glares down on Baghdad residents from every street corner, intersection, ministry and monument that shapes Baghdad's skyline.

To them, Hussein is not Iraq, and Iraq is not Hussein. Their country was the sacred cities of Najaf and Karbala, where members of Muhammad's family are buried. It is the cities from which their relatives came. And it is Baghdad, which they call theirs.

""If a foreigner wants to enter Baghdad in peace, we will welcome him like a brother,"" one daughter said. ""If a foreigner wants to enter as an enemy, every family will go out and confront them, even with stones. If they don't throw rocks, then they'll throw dirt.

""Not only the Iraqi army will fight, but the families, the children, even the elderly will,"" she said.

Karima looked on approvingly. But her life served as a note of caution. No one wants to be occupied, she said, and no one wants a war. No one asked foreigners, be they the Americans or others, to invade Iraq. But tragedy has visited her time and again, and in the powerlessness those calamities provoke, the only recourse is God. Being in his hands, she said, is their only comfort.

""It's true we have to fight for the sake of our nation, land and culture,"" she said. But using an Arabic expression that signifies fatalism and helplessness, she said: ""There's no life or power that does not come from God. What God wants will be."""
94,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"On a cold, concrete slab, a mosque caretaker washed the body of 14-year-old Arkan Daif for the last time.

With a cotton swab dipped in water, he ran his hand across Daif's olive corpse, dead for three hours but still glowing with life. He blotted the rose-red shrapnel wounds on the soft skin of Daif's right arm and right ankle with the poise of practice. Then he scrubbed his face scabbed with blood, left by a cavity torn in the back of Daif's skull.

The men in the Imam Ali mosque stood somberly waiting to bury a boy who, in the words of his father, was ""like a flower."" Haider Kathim, the caretaker, asked: ""What's the sin of the children? What have they done?""

In the rituals of burial, the men and their families tried, futilely, to escape the questions that have enveloped so many lives here in fear and uncertainty. Beyond some neighbors, family, and a visitor, there were no witnesses; the funeral went unnoticed by a government that has eagerly escorted journalists to other wartime tragedies. Instead, Daif and two cousins were buried in the solitude of a dirt-poor, Shiite Muslim neighborhood near the city limits.

The boys were killed at 11 a.m. today when, as another relative recalled, ""the sky exploded."" Daif had been digging a trench in front of the family's concrete shack that could serve as a shelter during the bombing campaign that continues day and night. He had been working with Sabah Hassan, 16, and Jalal Talib, 14. The white-hot shrapnel cut down all three. Seven other boys were wounded.

The explosion left no crater, and residents of the Rahmaniya neighborhood struggled to pinpoint the source of the destruction. Many insisted they saw an airplane. Some suggested Iraqi antiaircraft fire had detonated a cruise missile in the air. Others suggested rounds from antiaircraft guns had fallen back to earth and onto their homes.

Whoever caused the explosion, the residents assigned blame to the United States, insisting that without a war, they would be safe. ""Who else could be responsible except the Americans?"" asked Mohsin Hattab, a 32-year-old uncle of Daif.

""This war is evil. It's an unjust war,"" said Imad Hussein, a driver and uncle of Hassan. ""They have no right to make war against us. Until now, we were sitting in our homes, comfortable and safe.""

As he spoke, the wails of mourners pouring forth from homes drowned out his words. He winced, turning his head to the side. Then he continued. ""God will save us,"" he said softly.

At the mosque, hours after the blast, Kadhim and another caretaker prepared Daif's body for burial -- before sundown, as is Islamic custom.

Bathed in the soft colors of turquoise tiles, the room was hushed, as the caretakers finished the washing. They wrapped his head, his gaze fixed, with red and yellow plastic. They rolled the corpse in plastic sheeting, fastening it with four pieces of white gauze -- one at each end, one around his knees and one around his chest.

Kadhim worked delicately, his gestures an attempt to bring dignity to the corpse. He turned Daif's body to the side and wrapped it in a white sheet, secured with four more pieces of gauze. Under their breaths, men muttered prayers, breaking the suffocating silence that had descended. They then moved toward the concrete slab and hoisted the limp body into a wood coffin.

""It's very difficult,"" said Kadhim, as the men closed the coffin.

On Friday, he had gone to another mosque, Imam Moussa Kadhim, to help bury dozens killed when a blast ripped through a teeming market in the nearby neighborhood of Shuala. The memories haunted him. He remembered the severed hands and heads that arrived at the Shiite mosque. He recalled bodies, even that of an infant, with gaping holes.

""It was awful and ugly,"" he said. ""This is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.""

In an open-air courtyard, the men set the coffin down on the stone floor of a mosque still under construction. In two rows, they lined up behind it, their shoes removed before them. Their lips moved in prayers practiced thousands of times.

""God is greatest,"" they repeated, their palms facing upward in supplication.

In the background, men discussed the war. In the repression and isolation that reigns in Iraq, rumors often serve as news, and the talk today was of carnage unleashed on a convoy taking the body of an 80-year-old woman to be buried in the southern city of Najaf, where U.S. forces are confronting Iraqi irregulars and soldiers.

For Shiite Muslims, Najaf is among their most sacred cities, housing the tomb of Ali, the son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad, whom Shiites regard as his rightful heir. Tradition has it that the dying Ali asked his followers to place his body on a camel and bury him wherever it first knelt; Najaf was the site. Millions of pilgrims visit each year, and devout Shiites will spend their life's savings for the blessings of being buried in the vast cemeteries that gird the city.

The woman from Rahmaniya never made it. Residents said U.S. forces attacked three cars, one carrying her body. It was another ignominy visited on the city, the men agreed. They insisted that infidels would never enter the city by force of arms. The U.S. siege of the city -- its severity accentuated as rumors circulated -- was an act of humiliation.

""It's a disgrace,"" said Hattab, one of Daif's uncles.

Hussein, another relative, echoed the words of others. ""They didn't come to liberate Iraq,"" he said, ""they came to occupy it.""

In his words was a fear that strikes deep into the Iraqi psyche. Many worry that the U.S. invasion is a threat to their culture and traditions. They wonder if an occupation would obliterate what they hold dear, imposing an alien culture by force on a society that, in large part, remains deeply conservative and insulated.

""We don't want the Americans or British here. Our food is better than their food, our water is better than their water,"" he said.

With the prayers over, the men hoisted Daif's coffin over their heads. They left through the mosque's gray, steel gates and ventured into the desolate, dirt streets awash in trash. Some were barefoot and others wore sandals.

""There is no god but God,"" one man chanted. ""There is no god but God,"" the pallbearers answered. Bombing on the horizon provided a refrain. The men crossed the street, past concrete and brick hovels, the Shiite flags of solid black, green, red and white flying overhead.

As they approached Daif's house, its door emblazoned with the names Muhammad and Ali, they were greeted with wails of women covered by black chadors. They screamed, waving their hands and shaking their heads. The cries drowned out the chants, as the coffin disappeared indoors. The despair poured out of the home, its windows shattered by the blast that killed Daif.

""My son! My son!"" his mother, Zeineb Hussein, cried out. ""Where are you now? I want to see your face!""

The men in Daif's family embraced each other, sobbing uncontrollably on their shoulders. Others cried into their hands. From within the house came the sounds of women methodically beating their chests in grief.

In the houses along the street, neighbors and relatives spoke of injustice -- a resonant theme in the lives of Shiites Muslims, whose saints and centuries of theology are infused with examples of suffering and martyrdom.

""We're poor. We can't go anywhere else. What is the fault of the families here? Where's the humanity?"" asked Abu Ahmed, a 53-year-old neighbor sitting in a home with three pictures of Ali and a painting of his son, Hussein. ""I swear to God, we're scared.""

Their talk was angry, and they were baffled.

If the Americans are intent on liberation, why are innocent people dying? If they want to attack the government, why do bombs fall on civilians? How can they have such formidable technology and make such tragic mistakes?

In Hussein's Iraq, with a 30-year-political culture built on brutality, some were convinced the Americans were intent on vengeance for the setbacks they believed their forces were delivered in Basra and other southern Iraqi cities. Others, in moments of striking candor, pleaded for the United States and Britain to wage war against their government, but spare the people.

""If they want to liberate people, they can kick out the government, not kill innocent civilians,"" one relative said. ""The innocent civilians are not in business with the government. We're living in our houses.""

Before dusk, Daif's coffin was carried from his house. It was set on the back of a white pickup truck headed for the cemetery. As it drove away, kicking up clouds of dirt, some of the neighbors and relatives shouted, ""God be with you."" Other men waved, a gesture so casual that it suggested the strength of their faith, that they would eventually be reunited with Daif.

Hattab, the uncle, looked on at the departing coffin. His eyes were red, and his face was drawn.

""He has returned to God,"" he said. ""It's God's wish."""
95,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"Swept aside by U.S. troops who drove through the streets of Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein's government collapsed today, ending three decades of ruthless Baath Party rule that sought to make Iraq the champion of a modern Arab world but left a legacy of fear, poverty and bitterness.

As U.S. Army troops occupied the west bank of the Tigris River and U.S. Marines rolled into the eastern part of the city, facing only scattered resistance, thousands of Baghdad residents poured into the streets to celebrate the government's defeat and welcome the U.S. forces in scenes of thanks and jubilation.

With pent-up fury, the crowds also rampaged through offices of the government and state-owned companies, lugging away everything from plastic chairs to Toyota pickups once doled out as patronage. In festive moments, others tested their newfound freedoms, engaging in noisy debates in the street and denouncing Hussein in words that would have brought a death sentence only days ago.

The feared Baath Party apparatus disappeared from the streets. Its junior officials and militia fighters, once posted at every intersection, were nowhere to be seen. Many were said to have changed into civilian clothes to escape detection. Party uniforms and weapons were scattered at sandbagged positions that only days ago had been vaunted as the heart of a bloody last stand. Along some streets, military vehicles stood bleak and deserted, testimony that a once-efficient administration had come to a halt.

The fall of Baghdad -- and its celebration by thousands of Iraqis eager to heap scorn on their leader -- marked a climactic moment and a clear turning point in the war launched by the Bush administration 21 days ago to take down Hussein's government and rid Iraq of what U.S. officials said was a store of weapons of mass destruction.

Since launching the invasion from Kuwait March 20, U.S. and British forces have seized control of all the country's important centers south of Baghdad and at least two-thirds of its territory. The Euphrates River city of Hilla came under U.S. Army control today, completing occupation of the Euphrates Valley. The seizure of Baghdad added to the list the seat of Hussein's government and the heart of Iraq's old and storied civilization.

But Hussein, 65, his family, his ministers and members of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council remained unaccounted for, having vanished from public view over the last several days as U.S. forces closed in. U.S. officials cited radio traffic from the remote town of Qaim, in the far west near the Syrian border, as an indication some Hussein followers might be hiding there. In addition, several major Iraqi cities have not yet been occupied by U.S. forces, including Tikrit, Hussein's home town, and Kirkuk and Mosul in the northern oil fields.

'This Is Not Over' 
""There's a lot more fighting that's going to be done,"" Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned in Washington. ""There are more people [who] are going to be killed; let there be no doubt. This is not over, despite all the celebrations on the street.""

The Pentagon has identified 91 U.S. military personnel as killed in action or missing in action and about 400 wounded since the war began, a count that has often fallen behind reports from the field as information travels through the bureaucracy and families are notified. The number of Iraqi casualties has not been reliably compiled, but U.S. officials have estimated them in the thousands.

Although Hussein and his sons were targeted in an airstrike two days ago on the strength of intelligence that they were gathered at a meeting and vulnerable to attack, Rumsfeld said he did not know whether they were still alive.

""It is hard to find a single person,"" Rumsfeld said. ""It is hard to find them when they're alive and mobile, it's hard to find them when they're not well, and it's hard to find them if they're buried under rubble. We don't know. And he's not been around. He's not active. Therefore, he's either dead or he's incapacitated, or he's healthy and cowering in some tunnel someplace, trying to avoid being caught. What else can one say?""

But in Baghdad, today was for merrymaking as, in quick succession, U.S. forces took control of the streets and the symbols of Hussein's rule fell. In Firdaus Square, dancing crowds aided by U.S. Marines toppled a 20-foot statue of the longtime leader, his arm raised in Stalinist fashion. With ropes, residents dragged its severed head through the streets, cheering along the way. Hussein's ubiquitous portraits, as early as this morning still gracing newspapers, were smashed. On one defaced picture, a devil's horns were scribbled in black.

""I can tell you the fear has lifted from people's hearts,"" said Faleh Hassan, sitting at Abu Ahmed restaurant in central Baghdad.

It was a startling collapse for a government that, only three weeks ago, had predicted Baghdad would become a quagmire for invading forces and declared, with bluster and bravado, that it was debating whether to bury U.S. and British troops in mass pits or individual graves. It followed one of the quietest nights of the war in Baghdad, with only sporadic shelling and the crackle of gunfire.

Government No-Shows 
The fate of Hussein and his government was a mystery that intrigued Baghdadis as well as officials in Washington. But in Baghdad, there was no one to ask about it. For the first time since the war began, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahhaf, whose comments had grown increasingly bizarre as the war unfolded, failed to arrive at the Palestine Hotel to deliver his daily briefing. Only a day earlier, he insisted -- with not a hint of irony -- that Baghdad was bracing ""to pummel the invaders.""

Other Iraqi officials, who appeared less and less in public as the war progressed, were also nowhere to be seen, including Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay. Despite the bombing on Monday of a compound in the well-to-do Mansour neighborhood where Hussein was believed to be hiding, many residents of Baghdad expressed belief he survived and possibly went to Tikrit, the home base of his clan and many of his closest lieutenants.

Many spoke of settling scores with those officials. ""If I see my enemy before my eyes, I will kill him,"" said Hassan, the restaurant owner. ""To be honest, that goes for all Tikritis.""

But scenes of celebration were more common. In images broadcast around the world, hundreds of Iraqis poured into Firdaus Square, where they headed for a statue of Hussein perched on a 20-foot pedestal of purple granite. First came a sledgehammer. Men took turns knocking chunks off the base, to the wild applause of the crowd. Then a rope, tied like a noose, went over the statue's head. Finally, Marines brought an M88 tank recovery vehicle. They tethered one leg, then two, before finally settling on a thick chain that went around the statue's neck. It fell halfway, then crashed to the ground.

All that was left was the twisted metal of his feet, two rusted pipes jutting out.

With the rage of grievances accumulated over a lifetime, members of the crowd beat the fallen statue with sledgehammers, rocks, chains and their feet. Some slapped their shoes on it. Others made off with its head, dragging it through the streets.

""It was a strong statue,"" said Stefan Abu George as he watched the scene unfold. ""It's not strong anymore.""

Conflicting Emotions 
Down the street, crowds greeted U.S. troops with flowers, candy and, occasionally, kisses.

""We love you!"" some shouted. Others, with more anger, cried out, ""No more Saddam Hussein!""

Some scrambled for packaged meals-ready-to-eat the Americans handed out, almost setting off a riot near the tanks. Others picked flowers from a nearby park and distributed them to soldiers and anyone resembling an American. A few simply stood and stared, as curious as they were jubilant. For the first time in a half-century, troops were rolling down Baghdad's streets with a foreign flag.

Those conflicting emotions gave rise to odd moments.

""I'm not happy,"" George said. But when a tank rolled by, he waved. Then he declared, ""I love Saddam, he's courageous, he's a hero."" The words set off a boisterous debate in the streets, an argument of the sort not heard publicly in a generation.

""Saddam is a dog, a son of a dog,"" shouted Majid Mohammed, 47, an electrical engineer.

But even Mohammed's family bore the scars of a system that relentlessly tried to link its fate to Iraq's, its leader's destiny to its own.

""I'm sad,"" said Mohammed's 12-year-old daughter, Sara, as they left the scene. ""They stole our freedom.""

Her words pained Mohammed. ""Until now, I haven't been able to speak my feelings about him.""

Even during the jubilation, Hussein still felt present in Baghdad after such a long period as absolute ruler. He became the effective head of government soon after the Baath Party took over in a coup in 1968 and formally assumed the presidency in 1979. His sudden absence opened a horizon that was at once unknown and uncharted. Iraqis spoke freely, fascinated by saying words only expressed in private, and even then, in whispers. But there was a nagging sense that words were still monitored, that statements could come to haunt them.

""Are you sure the regime is gone?"" asked Mohammed Abdel-Amir, 34, a Shiite Muslim from Karbala.

Others had more mundane worries. They asked when electricity and telephones would return, after a week-long interruption. For others, it was the more fundamental issue of their relationship to U.S. forces that arrived today as liberators. Even in the celebratory scenes in the streets, some expressed hope that the U.S. presence would not become an occupation. Others were unsettled by the presence of a U.S. flag atop a column of tanks and other armor in a city whose name still resonates across the Arab world for its medieval glory.

""They got rid of the oppression, there's no question about that. But we want to know how it turns out -- are they here for our sake or for the sake of oil?"" said Shidrak George, 38, watching the crowds pull down Hussein's statue.

Reflection and Uncertainty 
In a country where virtually every family has a tale of suffering at the hands of the Arab world's most brutal government, the day prompted reflection -- over the fate of a rich country left poor and over a dictatorship that proved relentlessly durable. After three decades of powerlessness, many braced for the claims that the disenfranchised Shiite majority would make.

The uncertainty revolved as well around the enormous task of U.S. forces in crafting a new government. Many asked whether Iraqi dinars, emblazoned with a portrait of Hussein, could still be used. If not, when would they change? Others asked when the United States would return telephone service, cut off last week in a move that left the city isolated and secluded.

The war began in Baghdad with a barrage of missiles at a compound on the city's western outskirts where Hussein was thought to be hiding. What followed was an air assault that, at times, terrified the population. Casualties stayed relatively light when bombing targeted the symbols of Hussein's rule -- largely deserted presidential palaces, intelligence headquarters and government offices. They rose dramatically a week later when the attacks broadened to include telephone exchanges and transmission towers in crowded neighborhoods and, even more spectacularly, when U.S. forces arrived in the city on Saturday.

Kindi Hospital, which treats many of Baghdad's civilian wounded, this morning reported one of its busiest days.

Some said they would not forget the toll the war has caused among civilians. But remarkably, many seemed to look past it.

That future seemed to make some Iraqis more anxious. How long would the Americans stay, what did they plan to do, what government would they bring and what were their real intentions? The questions suggested that the United States -- its credibility suffering in much of the Arab world -- had a window of goodwill in a capital that seemed genuinely thankful for the removal of Hussein's government. But how long that window lasts may become a more pressing question in time.

""It's up to the Americans what this becomes,"" said Nazir Mustafa, 46, watching the tanks roll down the street. ""Maybe it will be colonialism, maybe it will be liberation from the regime. The truth will soon become apparent."""
96,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"By the standards of Iraq and its Shiite Muslim majority, Sayyid Muqtada Sadr is a blue blood.

He wears a black turban, signifying his privileged descent from the prophet Muhammad. For a century, his family has given Iraq its most revered clergy, men whose very word, blessed by God, goes unquestioned by their followers. Like a badge of honor, he bears the deep scars of ousted president Saddam Hussein's government, which assassinated his father and two brothers in 1999 in Najaf, one of the most sacred cities in Shiite Islam.

Now, by birth and choice, the 30-year-old Sadr, his hands soft from a life of religious study, has inherited his family's mantle of leadership.

In the void left by the precipitous fall of Hussein's government after a U.S.-led invasion, Sadr and his followers have overseen checkpoints to end looting and moved, with the force of arms and power of persuasion, to restore authority in the streets. They have kept a distance from U.S. forces, suspicious of their motives. Sadr and his men are cognizant that their authority derives from their independence. With little hesitation, Sadr has reached out to Iraq's powerful tribes for support and rallied his followers from the pulpit of Friday sermons.

In words lacking the usual subtlety of religious discourse, Sadr's message is clear: He is both a political and religious leader, carrying the still-resonant banner of the Sadr name. The future of Iraq, he insists, is in the hands of the Shiite majority he hopes to represent.

""I accept the burden and the responsibility,"" he said in a rare interview this week while in hiding here, fearful of conflicts with others in the Shiite community. ""We are with God and God is with us.""

Sadr and other clerics stand at the center of the most decisive moment for Shiite Muslims in Iraq's modern history. It is a revival from both the streets and the seminaries that will most likely shape the destiny of a postwar Iraq.

In the streets, the end of Hussein's rule has unleashed a sweeping and boisterous celebration of faith, from Baghdad to Basra, as Shiites embrace traditions repressed for decades. In politics, the prominence of clergy -- the major institution to survive the repression of Hussein's powerful Baath Party -- has signaled that in coming years, power may be reflected through a religious prism. And for Shiite populations abroad -- including in Iran -- the community's newfound freedom may reestablish the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala as centers of religion and politics, recasting an arc of Shiite activism that began with the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

But the community is already struggling with the challenges that will deepen as a new government is formulated. How will they interact with a United States that has done little to engage them? Will they relinquish the power they have seized to a more representative government, one that also includes Iraq's Sunni Muslims, Christians and Kurds? And how will they reconcile the deepening rivalries of personality and vision within the community that are already tearing away at the unity that the clergy so desire?

Some among Iraq's minority Sunni and Christian communities are gloomy, predicting sectarian strife reminiscent of Lebanon's civil war. They predict the United States will never accept a Shiite government, much less a religious one -- a concern shared by Sadr and many Shiite leaders. Others are more optimistic, hopeful that Iraq's diversity will temper the Shiite community's demands and that its moderation, so far, is a signal of intentions.

""Iraq could become an inspiration to the Shiite world,"" said Wamid Nadhme, a political science professor at Baghdad University.

Until then, much of Iraq, anxious and uneasy, is watching the writing on the wall -- graffiti that has exploded across Baghdad and other cities. The sentiments in those slogans chart the emergence, concerns and ambitions of the country's resurgent majority.

'The Tyrant Is Gone' 
On the walls of Najaf, Karbala and Baghdad, the slogan was simple. The tyrant Saddam. The tyranny has ended.

Within hours of Hussein's fall, hundreds of Shiite Muslims poured into the Kadhimiya shrine in Baghdad in demonstrations that ballooned into thousands. In chants and banners, the symbolism was unmistakable -- a reclamation of a 1,300-year-old faith relentlessly repressed by Hussein since the 1970s.

""The oppression is gone, however long it took,"" the crowd chanted, louder as they approached the shrine. ""The tyrant is gone.""

They held the green flags of Imam Ali, the prophet Muhammad's son-in-law, who Shiites believe was his rightful heir. The 7th century dispute over leadership, deepened by centuries of disenfranchisement and discord, has formed the lasting division of Islam into its Sunni and Shiite branches. Others carried the black banner of Hussein, Ali's son who -- outnumbered, betrayed and deprived of water -- was martyred in a battle in 680 at Karbala, near the Euphrates River. He was decapitated, his head carried away on a stake. Yazid, the caliph blamed for his death, is known to Shiites as the tyrant.

The celebrations are building toward a climax on Tuesday in Karbala, where thousands have already begun marching to mark the traditional 40 days' mourning that follows the anniversary of Hussein's death.

In a pilgrimage that until weeks ago brought a year in prison, they have come from Baghdad and Najaf, Nasiriyah and Basra. Some walked barefoot, in a symbol of the suffering Hussein endured. Others walked in groups, waving black, green and red flags that speak to their faith. They have crowded the roads, passing the craters and wreckage of war.

As they entered Karbala this week, many pounded their chests, a drumbeat of mourning known as lutm.

From the Shiite leadership down, the message has been that these celebrations are religious, not political. In gestures that have won admiration from skeptical Sunnis in Baghdad, clergy have reached out to their counterparts, seeking to portray unity and deflect attention from the internecine strife that many expected would erupt after the government's fall.

""No Shiites, no Sunnis, Islamic unity, Islamic unity,"" read one slogan on a mosque in Baghdad.

But others worry what comes next when Shiites seek to claim their political role as the majority.

""There are no problems now, but there will be problems between Shiites and Sunnis in the future,"" said Abu Nouri, a 66-year-old Shiite resident of Baghdad, as he gazed at the slogan. ""There will be competition for power.""

In some cities in Iraq, that competition has already started.

Taking Control of Cities 
Abdel-Mahdi Salami, a Shiite cleric, has risen to power in Karbala. With thick-framed glasses and a beard peppered in gray, Salami led a group of 25 clergymen who have effectively seized control of the city over the last month. They have deployed hundreds of armed men, keeping the streets remarkably quiet and stanching the looting that devastated Baghdad, Basra and other cities. They restarted the civilian administration, after expelling hundreds they deemed too tainted by the Baath Party. With banks under their control and donations they receive, they have paid salaries to Karbala city workers.

Their goal, he said, is simple. ""We want to make Karbala an example.""

It is a trait of Shiite clergy, from Lebanon to Iran, to disavow ambition; a lust for power is considered unseemly. Salami, who likes to call himself Karbalai, or ""from Karbala,"" has adopted that modesty. When asked who led the city's new government, run out of a dilapidated hotel for pilgrims, he looked at the ground. ""Many of us,"" he said softly.

""You're being modest,"" his followers cried.

""We work sincerely, and we have no ambition for power,"" Salami answered. ""But what we want is an administration for Karbala and the other provinces of Iraq that represents the people and delivers them what they want.""

Across southern Iraq, Shiite clerics have filled the vacuum left by Hussein's fall. Although they pay allegiance to the pre-eminent seminary in Najaf, led by Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, they speak with their own voices, some more bold in their independence than others. Like Sadr, they claim the birthright of their own families. The father and grandfather of Salami, for instance, were prominent clergy in their own right. Others tout themselves as favorite sons, carving out territory in neighborhoods of Baghdad, or entire cities.

In Kut, along the Tigris River, Sayed Abbas, a 52-year-old Shiite cleric, has seized the city hall, surrounded by legions of armed supporters who have promised to block the entrance of U.S. forces that have yet to recognize his right to rule the city. In poor Shiite swaths of Baghdad, Mohammed Fartousi, a cleric dispatched by the seminary in Najaf, has claimed authority over an unruly collection of Shiite preachers, some of whom have installed groups of armed men at their mosques. In Najaf, the seminary under Sistani and the followers of Sadr have each moved to administer a city whose very name speaks to centuries of Shiite religious authority.

Outside their offices, powerful tribes and local leaders have flocked to pledge their allegiance -- and seek their support.

""Most of the people listen to the clergy,"" said Hassan Mushin Hassan, a 53-year-old cement trader in Najaf. ""They have great influence over the people, and they will support the clergy to be the government. Why not?""

Suspicion of U.S. Intentions 
Among Shiites like Hassan, the symbol of religious authority in Iraq is the Hawza, a seminary established more than 1,300 years ago in Najaf and long the pre-eminent center of religious learning. Until recently, clergy fluent in Persian and Arabic -- Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini among them -- studied theology, law and logic there with its greatest living thinkers.

It then became a backwater, repressed by the secularist Baath Party and overshadowed by the prominence given to the seminary in the Iranian city of Qom after the revolution Khomeini led. But now, just weeks after the government's fall, the Hawza has again begun to flex its muscle, inspiring hope among some that its diversity of views will bring a new vibrancy to Shiite thought long dominated by Iran. Housing 3,000 students, the Hawza sprawls around the shrine of Ali here, a collection of low-slung, brown-brick buildings.

During the war, Sistani, a cleric of Iranian origin regarded as leader of the Hawza, urged Shiites to neither support nor oppose the U.S. invasion. In the chaos that ensued, he delivered religious judgments forbidding looting. Now, with U.S. forces on the outskirts of Najaf and Karbala, the seminary has begun saying that it does not view the American presence as welcome.

""The presence of foreigners in the country is rejected,"" said his son, Mohammed Ridda Sistani, who acts as his spokesman.

It is a refrain echoed by cleric after cleric. Many have boycotted any dealings with U.S. officials. Some of the clerics are still bitter over what they view as the failure of U.S. forces to support a Shiite uprising after the 1991 Gulf War and blame the U.S. troops for the recent looting and lawlessness. Many remain suspicious of U.S. intentions and, in more private moments, suspect it will hand-pick a government that will deprive them of power.

But there is sharp disagreement about the tactics to organize their opposition, a dispute at the heart of the growing differences among rival wings of Shiite leadership.

In a debate that has raged for decades, the clerics in Najaf say the seminary is deeply split between a traditional wing and an activist wing. They are divided over whether clerics have a role solely in the spiritual sphere or in secular affairs. The controversy generates such great sensitivity that senior leaders refuse to even discuss it. By all accounts, Sistani subscribes to the traditional wing that shuns politics, viewing it as beneath his religious calling.

""My father does not request authority and he's not concerned with politics in any form,"" said Mohammed Ridda, sitting in an office near the shrine of Ali with two simple wooden tables and thin mattresses laid across the floor.

Others, like Sadr, see the clergy as a force for change, their calling intertwined with politics. As Sadr put it, ""One hand with the Hawza, one hand with the people."" He is sharp in his criticism of Sistani's reserve.

""From Saddam until now, he has not intervened in anything,"" said Sadr, who requested and was refused a meeting with Sistani.

Rivalries May Grow 
The split between Sadr and Sistani is only one among a slew of rivalries and allegiances that many expect to grow amid the competition for power and influence. By tradition, all Shiites look to a senior cleric --marja al-taqlid -- endowed with the ability to arrive at original decisions on theology and law. Sistani is among those. But he is not the only one.

Sadr, dismissed by some for his age and lack of religious learning, looks to Kadhim Husseini Haeri, an exiled religious leader considered a successor to his father.

Some pledge loyalty to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, although some also question his scholarly credentials. Others, like factions of the shadowy Dawa Party, look to Lebanon's Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, once a spiritual guide of Hezbollah.

Those rivalries were blamed in part for the killing of two clerics at the shrine in Najaf on April 10. Since then, Sistani and Sadr have gone into hiding, fearful of more violence, and some have suggested Sadr was behind a move to exile Sistani.

Sadr, sitting under a clock bearing a portrait of his assassinated father, makes clear his seclusion is temporary. He insisted he would follow the orders of his marja. ""But if he gave me a choice to have a political role, I would accept it,"" he said, surrounded by a coterie of young advisers. ""I'm ready if I receive permission.""

In recent weeks, his leaflets, speaking in the name of his father and competing with Sistani's own, have gone up in Karbala. Next to them are statements from Haeri, urging Shiites to follow the teaching of Sadr's family. His followers have taken to calling the Baghdad slum of Saddam City after his father. Saddam Hospital in Najaf, where his father's body was taken, has been renamed Sadr Hospital. Across a portrait of Saddam in the capital reads the slogan, ""The blood of Sadr will not go in vain.""

In the interview, his son delivered his view of ties with the United States.

""I advise the Americans to ally with the Shiites, not to oppose them,"" he said.

He recalled what Shiites view as centuries of oppression and suffering. Added to that, he said, was the national character of Iraq -- of rebellion and dissent. ""You can read history,"" he said The Shiites ""will reject any government brought by America, any leader, any state. They have rebellion in their hearts."""
97,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"Two hours before the dawn call to prayer, in a village still shrouded in silence, Sabah Kerbul's executioners arrived. His father carried an AK-47 assault rifle, as did his brother. And with barely a word spoken, they led the man accused by the village of working as an informer for the Americans behind a house girded with fig trees, vineyards and orange groves.

His father raised his rifle and aimed it at his oldest son.

""Sabah didn't try to escape,"" said Abdullah Ali, a village resident. ""He knew he was facing his fate.""

The story of what followed is based on interviews with Kerbul's father, brother and five other villagers who said witnesses told them about the events. One shot tore through Kerbul's leg, another his torso, the villagers said. He fell to the ground still breathing, his blood soaking the parched land near the banks of the Tigris River, they said. His father could go no further, and according to some accounts, he collapsed. His other son then fired three times, the villagers said, at least once at his brother's head.

Kerbul, a tall, husky 28-year-old, died.

""It wasn't an easy thing to kill him,"" his brother Salah said.

In his simple home of cement and cinder blocks, the father, Salem, nervously thumbed black prayer beads this week as he recalled a warning from village residents earlier this month. He insisted his son was not an informer, but he said his protests meant little to a village seething with anger. He recalled their threat was clear: Either he kill his son, or villagers would resort to tribal justice and kill the rest of his family in retaliation for Kerbul's role in a U.S. military operation in the village in June, in which four people were killed.

""I have the heart of a father, and he's my son,"" Salem said. ""Even the prophet Abraham didn't have to kill his son."" He dragged on a cigarette. His eyes glimmered with the faint trace of tears. ""There was no other choice,"" he whispered.

In the simmering guerrilla war fought along the Tigris, U.S. officials say they have received a deluge of tips from informants, the intelligence growing since U.S. forces killed former president Saddam Hussein's two sons last week. Acting on the intelligence, soldiers have uncovered surface-to-air missiles, 45,000 sticks of dynamite and caches of small arms and explosives. They have shut down safe houses that sheltered senior Baath Party operatives in the Sunni Muslim region north of Baghdad and ferreted out lieutenants and bodyguards of the fallen Iraqi president, who has eluded a relentless, four-month manhunt.

But a shadowy response has followed, a less-publicized but no less deadly theater of violence in the U.S. occupation. U.S. officials and residents say informers have been killed, shot and attacked with grenades. U.S. officials say they have no numbers on deaths, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the campaign is widespread in a region long a source of support for Hussein's government. The U.S. officials declined to discuss specifics about individual informers and would not say whether Kerbul was one.

Lists of informers have circulated in at least two northern cities, and remnants of the Saddam's Fedayeen militia have vowed in videotaped warnings broadcast on Arab satellite networks that they will fight informers ""before we fight the Americans.""

No Protection From U.S. Troops 
The surge of informants has also provoked anger in Sunni Muslim towns along the Tigris. Some residents say informants are drawn to U.S. field commanders' rewards of as little as $20 and as much as $2,500. The informants are occasionally interested in settling their own feuds and grudges with the help of soldiers, the residents said. Others contend that the informers are exploiting access with U.S. officials to emerge as power-brokers in the vacuum that has followed the fall of the government on April 9.

""Time's running out. Something will happen to them very soon,"" said Maher Saab, 30, in the village of Saniya.

The U.S. military says bluntly it does not have the means to safeguard those providing intelligence. ""We're not providing any kind of protection at the local level,"" said Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the U.S. military commander in Iraq.

In Saniya, where slogans still declare ""Long Live Saddam Hussein,"" Abdel-Hamid Ahmed sat in a well-to-do house along dirt roads and arid fields of rolling hills where sheep graze. He proudly described himself as the first person to greet the invading Americans and ticked off the help he has offered since they arrived, most notably information on saboteurs of electricity wires.

Since then, he said, he has met U.S. soldiers at his house at least once a week, usually for no more than 15 minutes.

""I'm not an informer, but I help explain to the Americans the situation here,"" he said in a well-kept living room, adorned with a new Toshiba television, a stereo, karaoke machine and 15 vases of plastic flowers.

Ahmed, who works in the mayor's office, was on two lists of informers circulated in the village and in the nearby city of Baiji, 120 miles northwest of Baghdad. Under the heading, ""In the name of God, the most merciful and compassionate,"" each list had about 20 names, and, over the past month, the leaflets were left before dawn on doorsteps and utility posts. On the first list, he was ranked 10th; on the second, he said, he was fourth. He said he told the Americans about two men who distributed the list, and they were arrested.

In the street, some people have heckled him as an agent -- ""a grave word,"" he said. He has not been physically threatened, but a grenade was thrown at another person on the list, Kamil Hatroush, although neither he nor his family was hurt. Ahmed said he carries only a 9mm pistol, eschewing the almost standard AK-47s wielded by most Iraqis in the countryside.

""I'm not scared,"" Ahmed said, flicking his hand lazily and insisting that only a minority resent those working with the Americans. ""If someone wants to kill you, why would they give you a warning first? They would just kill you right away.""

Ahmed was kicked out of Baghdad's National Security College in 1983, the training ground for the government's sprawling apparatus of intelligence services. He said the disappointment led him to alcoholism, then part-time work, most recently at the mayor's office, where he earned the equivalent of about $2 a month.

""If the Americans offered me a job in security, I would work with them,"" he said. ""Every person has to plan for the future.""

U.S. military officials attribute most of their tips to good will, either out of an informant's desire to eliminate the vestiges of Hussein's rule that are unpopular even in the Sunni Muslim-dominated north, or to end attacks that have unsettled a region still reeling from the government's fall. Maj. Josslyn Aberle, a spokeswoman for the 4th Infantry Division, which is based in Hussein's home town of Tikrit, said only a ""very small percentage receive money"" and that the U.S. military vets intelligence before acting on it. Ahmed denied seeking money, saying he cooperates for the good of his town.

In Hussein's government, informers were encouraged, paid and protected by the intelligence services, a crucial but despised means of control in 35 years of Baath Party rule. Some residents contend today that at least some people in the new batch of informers -- those willing to defy mounting threats -- have charged protection fees or sold their services as perceived intermediaries with U.S. forces.

Outside Ahmed's house, a group of men sat in a battered white Toyota, as relatives sought an audience with Ahmed for help in getting back a car that was seized by the Americans.

Over the weekend, the family of five men arrested by U.S. forces near their base in Baiji said they gave Ahmed a sheep, worth about $30, to help secure the men's release. He denied it.

In Samarra, about 65 miles north of Baghdad, Abdel-Razzaq Shakr, the brother of the town's mayor, was on another list distributed in the town two weeks ago, with at least six names of suspected informers. Residents said people in the town had gone to Shakr for help with U.S. forces in getting their guns back and to deflect suspicion from friends and relatives.

Shakr acknowledged providing the Americans information on Baathists, but he denied taking money from residents.

""I haven't taken even a cent,"" said Shakr, 45, who is unemployed. ""On the contrary, I want to leave a mark on our town so that our children will thank their fathers for what they did.""

A grenade was thrown at his house on July 18. It landed in the courtyard near a tangerine tree, shattering windows but hurting no one. Another person on the list, Mustafa Sadeq Abboudi, was shot in the arm with an AK-47. Shakr said he has a pistol and a rifle, but his brother, Mayor Mahmoud Shakr, has urged him not to seek help from U.S. forces.

""The Americans cannot offer protection,"" the mayor said. ""If the Americans stood outside the door, it would only cause more trouble because it would mean he is definitely working with them.""

Sitting in a chair and holding a cup of sweet tea, the mayor expressed frustration. Suspicions have become so common that more than 100 Muslim clerics met last week and issued a statement that not all Iraqis working with U.S. forces should be considered informers. ""When ever somebody talks to the Americans,"" he said, shaking his head, ""they think he's an agent.""

Calls for Revenge
Residents of Thuluya said they had no doubt about Kerbul. After the operation in the village, dubbed Peninsula Strike, a force of 4,000 soldiers rounded up 400 residents and detained them at an air base seven miles north. An informer dressed in desert camouflage with a bag over his head had fingered at least 15 prisoners as they sat under a sweltering sun, their hands bound with plastic. Villagers said they soon recognized his yellow sandals and right thumb, which had been severed above the joint in an accident.

""We started yelling and shouting, 'That's Sabah! That's Sabah!' "" said Mohammed Abu Dhua, who was held at the base for seven days and whose brother died of a heart attack during the operation. ""We asked his father, 'Why is Sabah doing these things?' ""

In the raid, three men and a 15-year-old boy were killed, all believed by villagers to have been innocent. Within days, many focused their ire on Kerbul, who had served a year in prison for impersonating a government official and was believed to have worked as an informer after he was released. Young children in the street recited a rhyme about him: ""Masked man, your face is the face of the devil."" Calls for revenge -- tempered by the fear of tribal bloodletting getting out of hand -- were heard in many conversations.

Kerbul's family said U.S. forces took him to Tikrit, then three weeks later, he went to stay with relatives across the Tigris in the village of Alim. As soon as word of his release spread, his brother Salah and uncle Suleiman went there to bring him back.

""We sent a message to his family,"" said Ali, a retired colonel whose brother was among those killed during the operation. ""You have to kill your son. If you don't kill him, we will act against your family.""

His father appealed, Ali recalled, saying he needed permission from U.S. forces.

""We told him we're not responsible for this,"" Ali said. ""We told him you must kill your son.""

Kerbul's body was buried hours after the shooting, his father said, carried to the cemetery in a white Toyota pickup. He said he and Kerbul's brother accompanied the corpse. Salah, his son who fired the fatal shots, said he stayed home.

Neither U.S. military officials in Thuluya nor Tikrit said they were aware of the killing.

""It's justice,"" said Abu Dhua, sitting at his home near a bend in the Tigris. ""In my opinion, he deserves worse than death."""
98,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"In an austere room with concrete floors and walls adorned with two renderings of Islam's holiest shrine in Mecca, two brothers of Adnan Fahdawi pulled out a creased and torn green folder stuffed with the memorabilia of martyrdom.

There was a tag from the black body bag in which the 31-year-old Fahdawi's body had been delivered to the police station. ""Multiple GSW,"" read the bloodstained card, using a shorthand label for gunshot wounds. Cause of death: ""extrusion of brain matter."" Next, a picture of Fahdawi's hard, bearded face. Smoldering eyes, hinting at determination, stared out over a caption that declared him a martyred hero. After that was a letter he and several others had written before they attacked U.S. forces under a full moon on July 15 near this Euphrates River town.

""Today, we have sacrificed ourselves to defend our honor and pride,"" read the typed statement, embossed with traditional religious invocations in floral, Arabic script. ""We have sacrificed our souls for the sake of Islam, sacrificed our souls to get rid of the monkeys, pigs, Jews and Christians. To all our brothers and sisters, we prevail on you to be joyful with us.""

In the guerrilla war that grips the provincial towns and weary villages of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys, the U.S. occupation is meeting resistance from those President Bush has described as foreign terrorists and ""members of the old Saddam regime who fled the battlefield and now fight in the shadows."" They have a common goal, he said in an address this month: ""reclaiming Iraq for tyranny.""

But in this Sunni Muslim town colored in shades of brown and intersected by canals of open sewage, Fahdawi and the others who died are celebrated as heroes. Neighbors and relatives call them defenders of faith, not supporters of former president Saddam Hussein. And in their words, actions and ideas, relatives say, the men represent a homegrown movement, grounded in a militant reading of religion, that augurs a new enemy for the occupation.

Fahdawi and the five others hailed from different families and tribes, their relatives say, but were united by the resurgent piety that followed the collapse of Hussein's government in April. They were devotees of a militant Syrian preacher, whose once-banned bootleg tapes and videos sell for less than $1 and intersperse calls for jihad with images of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. They congregated in a small mosque, with a tidy garden of periwinkles and jasmine, whose chalkboard at the entrance reads, ""You, the ones who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as guardians.""

They went into the attack, relatives say, believing that their deaths would serve as a collective example.

""When the neighbors arrived, they said, 'We didn't come to give condolences, we came to give congratulations,' "" said one of Fahdawi's brothers, Salah, 33. ""He was a hero. We wish God would plant the faith in our hearts that He put in Adnan's.""

As the brother spoke, U.S. helicopters whirred overhead, a familiar sound in a town where guerrillas have repeatedly attacked U.S. forces and where the police chief, considered by many a collaborator, was killed last week. Salah Fahdawi, filled with pride, ignored them.

""Adnan truly believed in God,"" he said.

A Formidable Presence 
For weeks, Fahdawi's picture hung at the Mashaheer Barbershop, on Khaldiya's main drag. His portrait was bordered by roses. Written above it was the familiar Koranic saying: ""Do not consider dead those killed for the sake of God. Rather they are living with God."" Below it was inscribed the date of his death, July 15, and a caption saying he had been ""martyred for the sake of raising the words 'there is no god but God.' ""

The men at the barbershop said Fahdawi had been a formidable, even intimidating presence in this conservative town.

Born into a family of 14, he formed a construction crew after his discharge from the military, and he was a familiar sight on his battered red motorcycle in the serpentine alleys of Khaldiya. In his leisure time, he studied Islam with the town's elder cleric, 65-year-old Sheik Abed Saleh, and he brought religious fervor, they said, to almost every element of his life.

He never missed the obligatory five daily prayers, often performing them at the Nur Mosque. He fired his employees for not doing the same. He refused to eat with residents he suspected of looting in the war's chaotic, lawless aftermath. During the lunar month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sundown, he would refuse to speak with those he suspected of having cheated.

At 31, the equivalent of middle age in Iraq, he had yet to start a family of his own.

""He preferred to be a martyr than to marry,"" said Salah, his brother.

Neighbors and relatives said Fahdawi was at the center of the cell that came together for the attack. Through construction jobs, he met Khalil Huzeimawi, a stocky, 32-year-old father of five who moved from neighboring Fallujah a year ago. Fahdawi shared a passion for sports with Omar Shaabani, a quiet, 24-year-old father of three. And he was a childhood friend of both Hamid and Raed Kirtani, cousins in their twenties who worked together selling poultry from a shack built of chicken wire and dried reeds.

Each had his own lifestyle. Fahdawi was nicknamed ""the sheik,"" a reflection of his religious study and public demeanor. Shaabani and Huzeimawi were more mature, with families to raise. Hamid, the only one not to serve in the military, was working on obtaining a business degree in Baghdad, commuting 50 miles from Khaldiya on most days. Raed, who was supposed to marry last month, was obsessed with soccer, hanging pictures of Argentina's Javier Saviola, Gabriel Batistuta and his favorite, Diego Maradona, on his wall.

Relatives recalled that the men shared a growing piety after the war, along with new influences made possible by Hussein's fall.

The relatives said most of them enjoyed listening to Koranic recitation and began attending with devotion the Friday prayers at Khaldiya's Grand Mosque. At least three listened to the sermons of Mahmoud Quul Aghassi, the militant Syrian preacher. Relatives said two of them, upset and angry, went to the funeral in Fallujah for Sheik Laith Khalil, a fiery prayer leader who was killed June 30 together with six religious students in what U.S. officials said appeared to be a mistake during a ""bomb manufacturing class"" in his mosque.

While their neighbors complained of rising prices -- cooking gas that has gone from 16 cents to $2, cement that has gone from $20 to $90 a ton -- the men railed against the U.S. occupation, a presence they viewed through the prism of religion, not politics.

It was a message, relatives said, pronounced often at the Nur Mosque, a small worship hall down the street from a vegetable stand where the men often met. Inside the mosque, along freshly painted walls, is a picture of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites. Across the top, lettering reads, ""Jerusalem, we are coming.""

""The Americans are infidels,"" Sheik Aalam Sabar, a 33-year-old cleric, said as he sat on his mosque's spotless gray carpets. ""It is legitimate to fight the Americans.""

On the night of July 14, Fahdawi prepared for his death.

His brothers said he told his mother to put henna on the palms of her hands, a sign of joy and celebration often reserved for a wedding night. He told his family he wanted no grieving if he was killed -- not the tents set up for mourners, not the shooting in the air that traditionally marks funerals. As a martyr, they recalled him insisting, he believed he would be alive in heaven.

He sat down to a dinner of rice, tomatoes and eggplant. When the last call to prayer pierced the sweltering summer night, he got up from the table, said an abrupt goodbye and left through a yard of lotus trees. ""He didn't return,"" said Salah.

The muezzin's sonorous call, at 9:30 p.m., was the signal for the others.

Raed Kirtani had taken a bath and put on cologne, then laughed with his mother before leaving. Shaabani simply bid his family farewell. Some of the men donned their dark tracksuits and tennis shoes before they left. Others wore them under their dishdashas, a traditional gown. Fahdawi, his family said, had put his clothes in a bag and taken them to the mosque a day earlier.

'I Had a Feeling' 
They staged their attack near an ammunition depot where U.S. forces are still stationed, between Habanniya Lake and a canal that snakes along brown, rocky bluffs interspersed with scraggly eucalyptus trees and electric towers.

At about 1:30 a.m., Fahdawi and the others lay in wait as troops left the depot. U.S. officials at the time said the men might have been expecting Humvees. Instead, they met Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Armed with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s, they opened fire, but were outgunned. Fahdawi and four others were killed. A sixth fighter was captured. There were no U.S. casualties.

In central Khaldiya, a mile or so away, residents woke up and clambered onto their roofs to watch a battle that some said lasted 90 minutes, others three hours. But even before the fighting ended, relatives and friends said they knew what the outcome would be.

""I had a feeling,"" said Khaled Kirtani, Raed's brother.

As the sun rose, relatives went to the moonscape that was the battlefield. U.S. soldiers had taken the bodies to the hospital, a nearby base and finally Khaldiya. Left behind were 100-yard trails of blood, marking where relatives believed the bodies had been dragged away, along with spent rounds, soiled shoes and shreds of clothing. Muthanna, Shaabani's 19-year-old brother, found the bloodied, bullet-holed head scarves of Shaabani, Fahdawi and Huzeimawi. Nearby were the baseball hats, one emblazoned with the Nike logo, that had been worn by the Kirtani cousins.

""We delivered each one to their families,"" Muthanna said.

Sheathed in body bags and transported for hours in Humvees under a scorching sun, the bodies arrived at the police station in the afternoon. Khaled Kirtani said his brother's face was so mangled he could recognize him only by his hair. The belly of his cousin, he said, was ripped open. He thought Shaabani's body had been run over by a tank. Fahdawi's relatives said half his face was blown away.

Within hours, the relatives recalled, the men crossed the threshold from death to martyrdom in the eyes of the town.

Khaled said his brother's body seemed to retain a lifelike quality, as befitting a sacred death. ""There was no odor,"" he recalled, surprised even now. ""They had gone to meet God.""

In the funerals held the same day, hundreds of relatives and neighbors paid their respects.

Shaabani's father, Ahmed, 45, displayed a yellow and black notebook with the names of 40 relatives and 318 friends. Carefully recorded in handwritten script, it noted their names and the sums they gave -- from $1 to $14 -- to mark his death.

In Fahdawi's house, the family heeded his wishes and refused to cry as they received mourners who numbered -- in Salah's words -- ""200, 300, perhaps 1,000."" Sheik Abed, his former teacher, told the family not to wash the body, but, as is customary for martyrs, to bury it as was. He bestowed on Fahdawi an honorific reserved for fathers, a symbol of the marriage that awaited him in heaven.

As they placed his body in a white shroud, then inside a wood coffin, the sheik declined to utter the funeral prayers.

""A martyr doesn't need the prayers,"" Salah recalled the sheik saying. ""He's guaranteed to be in heaven. He's already there.""

Sheik Abed, a pacific man with a gray and black beard, was long the most influential cleric in Khaldiya. In an interview, he acknowledged knowing Fahdawi and said they had sometimes studied together, but he declined to call him a martyr. That's God's judgment, the sheik said. While he said he understood their reasons for fighting -- as Muslims, they should not be ruled by infidels -- he described the men as reckless and impetuous. The occupation is too young, he said, and it is too early to take up arms.

""It's not time for jihad,"" he said.

But relatives of the men said Sheik Abed is no longer an unquestioned voice in Khaldiya. With Hussein's fall, they said, the city has opened to influences that were once underground, currents that have swept the Arab world for a generation.

For Fahdawi and the others, Aghassi, the preacher also known as Abu Qaqaa, was their cleric of choice. Based in Syria, the tall, lanky Aghassi refrains from criticizing his own government but delivers a stern message of jihad that views the United States and Israel as allies in a campaign against the Muslim world. As it does for other Islamic preachers, the Palestinian cause sits at the heart of Aghassi's rhetoric, which is framed as a struggle between religions. In a booming voice, he punctuates his speeches with talk of traitors and mercenaries.

His cassettes and videos are available in religious bookstores in Jordan, but were circulated only by hand in Iraq before the occupation. Now they are freely sold in neighboring Fallujah for less than $1 each. Relatives said the young men around Fahdawi rented them for 15 cents, sometimes watching them together and trading them among themselves.

A Love for Death 
A gifted orator, Aghassi favors a style that builds to a crescendo, then softens, only to build again.

""We want manhood and heroism,"" he declared in one taped sermon, delivered to a crowd that broke into tears. ""We want people to love death and yearn for heaven. We want the words 'no god but God' to shake the world.""

Muslims, he said, should look to martyrdom ""as a thirsty man looks to water.""

In another video, he delivers his sermon as images are shown of planes flying into the World Trade Center, followed by pictures of the White House, Congress and Kremlin and sounds of loud explosions. In the background, the cleric stands clad in camouflage, with an M-16 rifle in one hand, a pistol in the other.

""America has tyrannized the Muslim nation,"" Aghassi said in a sermon titled ""The Cadence of Justice in the Time of Defeat"" and recorded last year. ""Pour on it your anger and change its strength to weakness, its wealth to poverty, its unity into disunity.""

On a cassette taped after Baghdad's fall, he railed against Arab leaders allied with the United States ""who know nothing but palaces"" and drew on Islamic history to make his points. While forgiving of Hussein and Syria's president, he suggested the conflict would unfold in a clearly religious context -- of infidels against believers, of Muslims against others.

""Show these mercenaries a black day,"" he intoned. ""Like a dark night, drown them in the Euphrates and the Tigris.""

Capt. Michael Calvert, a military spokesman in neighboring Ramadi, said U.S. troops along the Euphrates have yet to determine the motives for the guerrilla attacks that seem to be on the rise.

""If you can build us a profile,"" he said, ""we'll hire you.""

Little Doubt on Motives 

But Khaled Kirtani, whose brother was buried with his cousin in a cemetery overlooking the green-domed Sheik Masoud shrine, has little doubt about the men's motives. Their tombstones called them ""martyred heroes."" Ribbons colored the green of Islam are tied at the base.

Kirtani, like other relatives whose conversations are peppered with the phrases of Aghassi, said they died for God, not Hussein. ""Saddam Hussein put a tent over the Iraqi people,"" said Kirtani, 27. ""He cheated the Iraqi people.""

Slender and stern like his brother, Kirtani listed the former Iraqi leader's sins. He started the Iran-Iraq war, in which Muslim killed Muslim. He invaded Kuwait. He gave the Americans a pretext for occupying Iraq. And his army, he said, ""dissolved in minutes.""

""Saddam Hussein is behind all our problems,"" he said, wearing a black shirt inherited from his brother. ""My expectation is that Saddam Hussein is in the United States on an island. They'll build a monument for him because he made their mission easy.""

Some residents of this Sunni Muslim town express nostalgia for the days when their region was favored at the expense of the Kurdish north and the Shiite-dominated south. To many of them, Hussein stands as the embodiment of a recognized past as opposed to an uncertain future. But Kirtani angrily dismissed those sentiments, voiced most often by his parents' generation.

""The young people are waking up. I saw it with my brother and cousin,"" he said. ""They're not Baathists, they're not party members. They did it for God. When they saw the Americans come, raid the houses, steal from the people, they didn't accept it.""

He invoked the Koran. He quoted the prophet Muhammad's sayings. And he talked with the fervor of the converted.

""The American people should realize they're going to start receiving coffins,"" Kirtani said. ""We're not their slaves."" He stopped to catch his breath, shaking his head as if uttering a self-evident truth. ""We accept death as easily as we drink water."""
99,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"Staring down on the crowds of Najaf are portraits of men killed during 35 years of Baath Party rule. They were clergy, their families and followers who were assassinated or executed, often tortured first. Along the street's colonnade are leaflets celebrating the community's new freedoms. Signs announce the anniversary of the death of Shiite Islam's most revered saint, and rickety stands offer the beads and prayer stones of ritual long discouraged. On banners and posters are the demands of the resurgent community. Elections, some insist. Others urge loyalty to the clergy or call on the young to join the muammimeen, or turbaned ones.

Through the landscape walked Heidar Moammar, a gaunt, 25-year-old cleric in a white turban.

""What was forbidden is beloved,"" he said, smiling as he glanced at the signs of the city's reawakening.

Across a thousand-year history as a seat of Shiite Islam, Najaf has weathered pillaging by puritanical tribes from the desert, the tyranny of Sunni Muslim rulers in Baghdad and the ascent of rival seminaries in Iraq and Iran. But in the wake of the fall of former president Saddam Hussein, a rebirth is underway in a city that, by virtue of its religious stature, looks to Baghdad as its equal. Long-dormant Shiite seminaries are proliferating, hotels are being built to cope with tens of thousands of pilgrims, and the bazaars of Najaf are boasting of profits that have doubled, even tripled, despite growing frustration with a lack of basic services.

More than just a city's renaissance, Najaf's revival is a story of shifting fortunes and unintended consequences in the tumult of postwar Iraq. The U.S. invasion dismantled one system, the construction of another is lagging, and a vacuum of leadership has ensued. With renewed confidence, the clergy have begun fashioning their headquarters into the spiritual capital of the country, and their leaders as the guardians of Iraq's Shiite majority. Few endorse Iran's Islamic government and perhaps even fewer support the U.S. goal of a secular state. But in between are vigorous debates -- over law and religion, Islam and state -- that could resonate throughout the Shiite world, where Iran and its revolution have long held sway as the unchallenged model.

Moammar -- a religious student by age 13, a prisoner in Hussein's jails by 16 -- sees himself as a soldier in that struggle.

As the call to Friday's prayers floated along the Prophet's Street, he walked toward the shrine of Imam Ali, the gold-domed resting place that gives Najaf its sanctity. The melancholy call clashed with the city's vibrant sounds. Iranian pilgrims chattered in Persian. Television blared footage of a Shiite ceremony from Iran and the training of a Shiite militia. Vendors hawked cassettes of ritual chants of grief, near piles of yellow brick for construction. Along one wall, scrawled in red, was a slogan that declared, ""Saddam is a criminal.""

""This is the freedom that is available to the Shiites,"" Moammar said. ""In the time of the tyrant Saddam, no one could let even a prayer fall from his tongue.""

He glanced at leaflets announcing the opening of new religious centers -- Imam Mahdi, Imam Ali, Imam Sadiq. ""Space is very limited,"" one said. An advertisement offered courses to memorize the Koran. The prize: a trip to the Iranian shrine of Mashhad.

And, in the tone that tolerates little compromise, politics were in the air. A poster pictured Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, his fist raised. ""Absolutely no to Israel, absolutely no to America,"" it said. In another, Mohammed Bakir Hakim, killed with dozens of others in a car bomb in August in Najaf, looked out with a halo around his head. ""Our submission is out of the question,"" it read.

""The future of Najaf depends on the future of Iraq,"" Moammar said as he walked the street. He thought for a moment, then insisted the opposite was true as well. ""Najaf is the only guarantee for the Shiites and for Iraqis.""

'Money From God' 
Sitting in a lobby smoking a water pipe, with a grin that comes with dazzling profit, Farhan Thijil celebrated his good fortune. For two months, busloads of Iranian pilgrims, seizing the opportunity of an open border, have kept his 45-room hotel booked solid. He has more than tripled his rates -- from $8 to $25. His revenue has jumped five times, he estimated, and he no longer pays taxes. His only inconvenience: angry pilgrims who, he said, feel they are being cheated. (They often are, but not by him, he insisted.) Who does he credit?

""It's money from God,"" said the ebullient Thijil. ""And the thanks after that go to the shrine of Imam Ali.""

""If it wasn't for the shrine,"" he added, blowing as he flicked his wrist, in a motion that suggested throwing it all away, ""nothing.""

Baghdad and Najaf are both cities of geographical coincidence. Baghdad was founded by a medieval Arab emperor, who chose the site after spending what a contemporary historian called ""the sweetest and gentlest night on Earth."" By tradition, Najaf was founded when a dying Ali -- a son-in-law and cousin of the prophet Muhammad whom Shiites consider his heir -- instructed his followers to put his body on a camel and bury him where it knelt.

To their residents, both are cities whose pasts outshine their present. But unlike Baghdad -- mired as it is in frustration and violence -- Najaf has showed signs of recapturing its luster.

""A million times better than Baghdad,"" as Thijil put it.

Real estate has skyrocketed. Next to Thijil's hotel, a 7,250-square-foot parcel has gone from a price of $25,000 in 1999 to $1.4 million today. Twenty hotels are under construction; the existing 120 hotels are all full.

In the covered market -- bombed by the Iraqi army after a 1991 Shiite uprising and then looted by Iraqi soldiers -- Iranian pilgrims haggled with vendors, nearly all of whom speak some Persian. ""Visit me! Visit me!"" a merchant shouted to visitors in English. Young boys pushed carts down alleys lined with goldsmiths, appliance and clothing stores, and pastry shops baking a Najaf specialty known as dahina.

""In Saddam's days, tomorrow was worse than today,"" said Aqil Rubaie, a jeweler. ""Now tomorrow is better than today.""

Like many in Najaf, Rubaie had a list of complaints. Electricity, as in much of Iraq, has become scarcer in past weeks. That, in turn, has hampered the water supply. A shortage of gasoline has made for hours-long waits in lines that snake down the street. Security remains a mantra among residents, who still shudder at the memory of the Aug. 29 car bombing, the worst in Iraq since the government's fall.

""We're a rose between the thorns,"" he said. ""The scent is not enough. We want to grasp it in our hands.""

No one in Najaf seems to know the precise number of pilgrims who have unleashed the boom. The overwhelming majority are from Iran, but others have come from Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. For the pilgrims, many of them elderly, Iraq is a journey of a lifetime. Six of the 12 most revered Shiite saints are buried within its borders, and pilgrims typically spend a few days in Najaf before making their way to Karbala, then on to shrines in the Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad and Samarra to the north.

""There's 2,000 a day,"" said Najah Bahash, a jeweler whose family has worked in the market for 40 years.

""Maybe more,"" interjected his friend, Heidar Najafi.

""At night, they're sleeping in the street!"" Bahash said, throwing up his hands.

Bahash runs a store selling rings of carnelian and other stones thought to bring blessings, and he speaks about traditions with the authority of his family's experience. This ring, he said, pointing to a particularly old stone from Yemen, stops bleeding. This one, he said, holding up a ruby, regulates the heartbeat. Jade, he added, settles the stomach.

His revenue from the rings has tripled, and he delights in telling stories about dozens of Sunni businessmen visiting him to ask about opportunities in Najaf. Like the rings, he said, his city is driven by tradition, and its traditions are the key to its future.

""Najaf is considered the capital of the Shiites,"" he said. ""We expect Najaf to be the capital of the future.""

Surviving Hussein 
Adel Zirgani followed a circuitous path to the seminary.

Born to a family of eight in the southern city of Nasiriyah, he began his adult life as a reporter for the newspaper Babel, owned by Saddam Hussein's son Uday. In time, he was fired. He was a gadfly, he said, in a business that tolerated almost no dissent.

The Persian Gulf War followed, and after that came the Shiite uprising that was encouraged, then abandoned, by the first Bush administration. Scarred by its toll -- thousands killed, their bodies filling mass graves -- Zirgani chose to enter the clergy, splitting his time between study in Najaf and a mosque where he preached in Nasiriyah.

He estimated that he was detained 10 times in the decade that followed. Of his 30 fellow students, he said, 15 were arrested and 10 were executed. He suspected that of those who weren't detained, many were spying.

""I never slept well before the fall of Saddam,"" he said. ""Now I sleep well.""

On this day, he had registered for classes at the Imam Ali College, a new religious school set up by one of Iraq's leading religious parties, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. In Hussein's time, he was afraid to openly accept stipends that serve as a student's income. Now, at the beginning of each month, he visits the offices of the four highest-ranking ayatollahs and collects a monthly subsidy -- about $12.50 from each, $50 in all. He was determined, he said, to restore respect for the clergy.

""This is the land of the prophets. This is an Islamic country,"" he said. ""This is where the revival should happen.""

For centuries, Najaf was the preeminent seat of Islamic scholarship. Its seminary, founded in the 11th century and known as the Hawza Ilmiya, often maintained an element of independence. In modern times, brilliant clerics such as Mohammed Baqir Sadr planted the seeds of Shiite religious activism in the 1950s and '60s. But Najaf was long feared for its influence, and Hussein's Baath Party was well aware of the decisive role the clergy had played in crucial moments of Iraq's history. Hundreds of clerics were arrested, expelled or killed, independent sources of income were stanched, and students were relentlessly harassed.

The best estimates say those students numbered in the thousands before the Baath Party seized power in 1968, and in the hundreds -- perhaps dozens -- when it fell. As Najaf emerged after the U.S.-led invasion this spring, it was left with little more than its reputation for past glory.

""It is still the mother of all Hawzas,"" said Hussein Sadr, a ranking cleric in Baghdad who was educated in Najaf, referring to the seminary-based fraternity of scholars.

Along the Prophet's Street, the new openness is everywhere. Mohammed Baqir Sadr's books -- imported from Lebanon and copied in bulk in Baghdad and Najaf -- line shelves. At the Imam Sadiq Center, down a winding alley, Majid Zeini shows off his stacks of books from Lebanon's most prestigious cleric, Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who once served as the spiritual leader of Hezbollah, a militant Shiite movement. Fadlallah's religious organization in Beirut sent dozens for free, adding another current to what has become an intellectual free-for-all unmatched anywhere in the Shiite world.

""The tyrant has collapsed,"" said Zeini, who returned in September from 23 years of exile, ""and new horizons have opened.""

Sitting on a green Persian carpet, leaning against pillows that match, Qassim Hashemi has emerged as a force in the expansion of the city's religious scholarship. A member of the Supreme Council, Hashemi has helped oversee the establishment of the Islamic University, with a student body of 200. Registration has begun for the Imam Ali College, which specializes in the Shiite equivalent of missionary work and staffing mosques with Friday prayer leaders. He said he expects 300 students, maybe more. A counterpart for women, the Zahra College, is planned to follow. About 160 women have already enrolled, he said, after they met the requirements -- age 17 to 30, high school graduate, their father's permission and a character evaluation.

The growth is no less dramatic in the more traditional seminary. At one point, lessons were offered to students in only three mosques and the homes of senior clergy. Renowned seminaries had become dormitories; studying there was considered too risky. Since the fall, however, the number of seminaries has grown to as many as 40, the most influential of them run by a group loyal to a radical cleric, Moqtada Sadr.

Along with their revival is the return of hundreds of students to Iraq. Hashemi estimated that at least 50 scholars had come from the prestigious Iranian seminary of Qom, which has eclipsed Najaf.

""Day after day, the Hawza is improving,"" said Hashemi, who himself returned to Iraq after 13 years studying in Qom. ""The day is coming when we will be able to say, 'This is the Hawza. Pay attention to it.' ""

Guidance and Direction 
Assembled with brick but constructed by ideas, that Hawza is now being built. Its architects are steeped in tradition, endowed with prosperity and emboldened by ambition. In a contest for leadership, they view themselves as the arbiters of Iraq's future.

The judgments they make will echo across a country in ferment and pose the greatest challenges to U.S. aspirations for Iraq. At stake is the very essence of the nation's future -- the line between religion and law, between faith and government.

In the clerical families that have long held sway in Najaf, Mohammed Hussein Hakim claims proud parentage. His great-grandfather was Muhsin Hakim, a renowned marja al-taqlid, or source of emulation, the highest clerical rank. His father is Mohammed Saeed Hakim, who sits with three other clerics -- among them Ayatollah Ali Sistani -- as the four marjas in Iraq today. He speaks for his father. His message is that the marjas see this moment in history as theirs.

""Who will guarantee the rights of the people?"" he asked, sitting in the courtyard of his home. ""Who will prevent the exploitation of the people and prevent the repetition of the same experience we have already endured?""

The U.S.-led administration has proposed carrying out Iraq's transition to sovereignty, beginning with a basic law by February and a provisional government by June. The process -- cobbled together in hasty deliberations -- will play out over months.

Hakim and other clerics said they viewed the process in years, even decades. Many acknowledge the decisions they make will determine the legacy of the clergy and their city for future generations. Their perspective is shaped by the sense of betrayal and duplicity in the Shiite community's past. A conversation in Najaf rarely ends without mention of the 1991 uprising. Often referred to are the 1920 revolt against British occupation and battles over Iran's constitution in the 19th and 20th centuries.

""We have a previous experience with the foreigners,"" Hakim said. ""Is it possible to trust them?""

The clerics see themselves as the last and perhaps only bulwark to protect what they call Iraq's Islamic identity. Suspicions abound -- that the Americans fear elections will show Shiites are an even greater majority, that elections will prevent U.S.-advocated secularism, that elections will give voice to the influential clergy, if only indirectly.

""America doesn't cross the seas and spend of millions of dollars for the purpose of leaving,"" said Bashir Hussein Najafi, the son and spokesman of another marja. Delaying elections, he said, ""is another reason for them to remain here.""

But even today, very few in Najaf advocate a direct role for clerics in Iraq's future government. Many see Iran's theocracy as an aberration of centuries of Shiite thought in which the clergy were not the rulers, but an effective counter-establishment. Instead, the phrase heard often in Najaf is ""irshad wa tawjeeh"" -- guidance and direction. Debate is underway over what guidance and direction mean.

""We believe in God, we believe in the Koran, and I am a Muslim, but there is a difference in claiming you represent God. The person who claims he is the legitimate representative of God is a liar,"" said Ayad Jamal Din.

Jamal Din, 42, is a cleric at one end of the debate -- in the clergy's context, admittedly extreme. He rejects any political role by the four marjas -- three of whom were born outside Iraq. He has no problem, he said, with guidance and direction, but it should amount to no more. Even he hesitates to use the word secularism, given the baggage it carries among clerics. But the concept is clear in his argument -- an unbreakable barrier should be established between religion and state.

""I've said more than once that I have no problem with the president of Iraq being an apostate, Christian or Jew,"" said Jamal Din, who returned after 24 years in exile. ""I don't want to pray behind the president. I want the president to manage the country.""

Moammar, the cleric walking down the Prophet's Street, bristled at the notion. The clergy should be able to dismiss the president, he insisted. They should be the final arbiters of what violates sharia, or Islamic law.

""Sharia is above the law,"" said another cleric, Mustafa Jabari. ""Sharia is the law.""

With Ghaith Shukur, Jabari edits the magazine Holy Najaf, sponsored by Iraq's marjas. Both have served in the clergy for nearly a decade. Both have weathered Hussein's repression, and both insist their role will be greater than that advocated by Jamal Din.

They listed the laws that would contradict sharia -- inheritance laws that did not generally grant male relatives twice as much as female relatives, interest on loans, artificial insemination and taxes beyond traditional religious levies. The marjas would decide when disputes arose. Sharia itself should be the only source of legislation.

Anything short of that, they said, endangers the country's Islamic identity.

Sitting in the magazine office, over cups of sweet, dark tea, Shukur compared the struggle between the Americans and the clergy over the law to two men walking in the desert. They have one piece of bread between them.

""Who gets it?"" he asked."
100,WP,Shadid,2004,Iraq Invasion,"The Bridge of the Imams draws together two Baghdads and divides two Iraqs.

Arching over the Tigris River, the overpass ends in Kadhimiya, a Shiite Muslim neighborhood built around the gold-domed shrine of a descendant of the prophet Muhammad. On Friday, the neighborhood pulses with promise. Pilgrims crowd its intersections, sidewalks overflow with money-changers, jewelers and kiosks brimming with hummus, cardamom and olives. Slogans written on the walls declare deposed president Saddam Hussein an infidel, and newspapers celebrate the capture of the man they call the tyrant.

At the other end of the bridge is Adhamiya, a grim Sunni Muslim neighborhood where the venerated Abu Hanifa Mosque is shielded behind eight steel barricades. Its twin minarets, clock tower and brick walls bear the scars of war. The slogans along the neighborhood's streets, where many of the shops are shuttered, convey nostalgia and anger. ""Long live Saddam,"" reads one, scrawled in black. ""Jihad is our way,"" declares another. A dozen or so men carrying AK-47 rifles sit atop the mosque's roof and patrol the street below, casting wary glances toward the bridge and the celebrations beyond.

""The future? What's the future?"" asked one of the guards, Ammar Abu Nour Quds. ""We don't have any future.""

Of the emotions unleashed by Hussein's arrest, the darkest were those that gripped the country's Sunni minority, of which Hussein was a member. As a new Iraq unfolds, with Hussein's arrest the latest milestone, they are on the inside looking out -- a community besieged, leaderless and relentless in its refusal to accept the eight-month U.S. occupation. The Sunnis' reversal of fortune marks a spectacular shift for a group that for most of the country's modern history, and for centuries before that, guided Iraq through colonialism and coups, dictatorship and war.

In interviews across the Sunni Triangle, which gave Hussein much of his support and suffered the most with his fall, many insist they are no longer fighting for the privilege they enjoyed in previous decades, but rather for their community's survival in a country with a Shiite Muslim majority. Once divided and discredited clergy have stepped forward to try to end a crisis of identity, bringing a message of political Islam to a community that once embraced secular Arab nationalism and tribal traditions.

No longer kingmakers, the community's leaders vow that they still hold the key to stability. But casting a shadow over conversations with men such as Quds is a sense of dispossession, of a minority searching for a voice in the contest to create a new state.

""The people are waiting for something, to hear something, to see something,"" said Khaled Ahmed, a 23-year-old Sunni whose photo store is across the street from the Abu Hanifa Mosque. He listened for a moment to the sermon, a homily urging restraint and unity that was broadcast from loudspeakers. ""They're waiting for some kind of hope,"" he said.

'A People Without' 
Col. Abdullah Jassem and his brother, Gen. Abed Jassem -- two retired military officers from the northern town of Thuluya -- still espouse hope for what they admit is unlikely, that Hussein was somehow not captured.

It is the talk that swirls through towns in the Sunni Triangle and neighborhoods of Baghdad. In Tikrit, near Hussein's ancestral home town, young men insisted, without a hint of doubt, that the former Iraqi president visited Wednesday and doled out ""10 papers"" -- Iraqi slang for $1,000 -- to the sheik of the Bayt Habous mosque. His message: distribute it to the poor. They recounted another story, spread at a wedding last week, that Hussein was seen in the streets of Tikrit on the day of his capture, Dec. 13, greeting the people.

""I have some suspicions,"" Abdullah Jassem said while sitting in his home with a riverfront view of the meandering Tigris.

For the Jassem brothers, men of rural origins who rose to influence and prestige under the 35-year rule of Hussein's Baath Party, the suspicions derive as much from their fear of the future as from their loyalty to the past.

The Sunni Triangle stretches from the Iranian border in the east to Syria in the west, an arid region of central Iraq made livable by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. But until Hussein took power, it was the Sunni elite in the capital -- not their poor, rural cousins -- who controlled the country. Blessed with wealth, education and the favor of overlords, they were the administrators and officers under the Ottoman Empire, then in large part through inertia, the favorites of the British who arrived after World War I.

To build the Baath Party, Hussein broke their hold on the country. Ever suspicious, he relied on the ranks of his fellow disenfranchised Sunnis, the neglected from cities such as Tikrit, Samarra and Thuluya. At first, he recruited from tribes, imbued with the fierce, often unforgiving traditions of the countryside. While, in time, he narrowed the ranks of his faithful to his family, men such as the Jassems profited, and today, the ranks of Thuluya's newly unemployed are filled with former military officers, intelligence agents and bureaucrats.

Hussein guaranteed their interests and provided their patronage. In a region given to prejudices against Shiites, he ensured that power would remain out of Shiite hands. Until Hussein's capture last week, when he crawled out of a dirt hole without resistance, the Jassems thought they shared with Hussein the ideals of dignity, pride and honor. After his arrest, they felt only shame, another reflection of their growing humiliation.

In Thuluya and elsewhere, the word that punctuated their conversations was ihana, insult.

""He's supposed to fight with honor, he's supposed to defend his honor,"" Abed lamented. His brother shook his head in dismay. He stretched out a leg crippled by shrapnel during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. ""We believed in him, that he would always resist,"" he said. ""We can't believe that he would be reduced to his level, as a coward.""

""Believe me, the day of his capture was the same as the collapse of Baghdad, maybe worse,"" Abdullah added.

Qahtan Jabbouri, a friend sharing small cups of bitter coffee, interrupted. ""We are now a shaab biduun,"" he said. ""A people without.""

Feeling Disenfranchised 
For generations, sect and ethnicity have cast a long shadow over Iraq, and under Hussein's clan-based rule, Shiites and Kurds were the most frequent victims of his government's brutal repression. But now, in the freewheeling, postwar era, sect and ethnicity have come to define politics almost exclusively, with explicit quotas determining the allotment of power and patronage under the U.S.-led occupation. In that contest, the Kurds are represented by the community's two traditional parties. The Shiites, comprising perhaps 60 percent of the population, have a voice through formerly exiled groups or clergy, both radical and mainstream, who emerged forcefully in the wake of Hussein's fall.

The Sunnis, about one-fifth of Iraq's people, find themselves largely disenfranchised, posing a formidable challenge to the U.S.-led administration that is trying to craft an inclusive political process to transfer power by June.

The Baath Party, its leadership traditionally dominated by Sunnis, was outlawed in May. The Sunni-led Iraqi Islamic Party, whose leader serves in the U.S.-appointed Governing Council, struggles for support among a constituency that, in overwhelming numbers, refuses to accept the status quo. In the words of one leading Sunni cleric, Abdel-Salaam Kubeisi, the party does little more than ""market the occupation."" The sheiks of Sunni Arab tribes, aggressively courted by the U.S. administration, are seen by many Sunnis as compromised.

""In the past they took money from Saddam,"" Jabbouri said. ""Now they're taking money from the Americans.""

The sense of disenfranchisement is powerfully felt among Sunnis. Even today, many are reluctant to identity themselves by sect. They insist they are Muslims and that sectarian differences are only a ploy to divide Iraqis. Others say they are Arabs, even as the Arab nationalism that gave them voice has receded. Often, they identify themselves in opposition -- against the occupation or, more commonly, as a besieged community, facing an escalating campaign of shadowy killings of Baathists and Sunni clergy.

""We were the heads of the Arabs, and the people were happy,"" said Mohammed Abed, 24, owner of a CD store in Tikrit, recalling an Arab proverb. ""But by God, time has turned its face on us, and we've now been placed at the mercy of the villains.""

The play list at Abed's store is a window on such sentiments. It points to a society that he and others believe is growing more radical and ceding ground to once-divided clergy that can claim independence and moral stature.

From a room decorated with posters of Arab and international pop stars -- Kadhim Saher, Assala and Britney Spears -- he points to the video that he has trouble keeping on the shelf. It is by Sabah Abu Hashim Jannabi, an Iraqi singer from the northern city of Mosul. It is titled ""Wrath,"" and at about 50 cents a piece, he said he sells 40 or so a week -- by far his best seller.

The video is a wild mishmash of images -- scenes from ""The Lion of the Desert,"" a movie starring Anthony Quinn as the famed Libyan guerrilla leader Omar Mukhtar, promotional video from U.S. armed forces and relentlessly violent footage taken from Arab satellite networks and Fox News of U.S. attacks and raids in Iraq.

To a heavy drumbeat, Jannabi sings: ""America is losing in the thousands. Our paths are paved with bullets.""

The Clergy's Role 
Sheik Nadhim Khalil represents a new generation of leader. He has achieved influence by religious appeals and anti-occupation rhetoric. Only 25, he has led the Caliphs Mosque, Thuluya's oldest and most prominent, for seven years. Since the government's fall, he said, worshipers have tripled in number. Plans are underway, he said, to build a new floor to house them.

His followers, many of them young, point to his credentials. The Americans raided his house last month, they said -- a sure sign of his independence. Under Hussein, they recalled, he was questioned often for his sometimes explicit criticism of the government -- that it should build schools rather than palaces, that its administration lacked the justice of Islam's forebears.

""Now there's space. Now there's an opening,"" said Khalil, sitting atop red Persian carpets and leaning on pillows stacked against the wall, which was adorned with framed verses of the Koran. ""Only the mosques represent the Sunnis.""

While fearing their influence, many Sunnis express envy at the authority commanded by the most senior Shiite clergy. To religious Shiites, the pronouncements of the grand ayatollahs carry the force of law, and the clerics' ascent through a rigid hierarchy of scholarship is measured by their prestige among their followers. In times of change, the institution provides a voice of the community.

Through history, the Sunni clergy have lacked that status, tainted by what many view as subservience to the state and bereft of stature in a sect that, at its most orthodox, sees no intermediary between man and God.

Now, the Sunni clergy are trying to raise their standing. Just days after the government's collapse, several clerics established the Commission of the Muslim Clergy. Today, it claims 3,000 members, with offices in most provinces. Its advisory council of 41 scholars and clerics and secretariat of 11 meet weekly, and its statements speak explicitly on behalf of the sect. The most recent warned of consequences of more killings of Baathists and clergy.

""We have moral authority with the majority of the Sunni people,"" said the group's spokesman, Abdel-Salaam Kubeisi. ""But there is no doubt now that things are boiling. The question is how long we can control the feelings of the people.""

In his own way, Khalil has repeated the commission's experiment. Inside Thuluya, perched on a bend in the Tigris, he has convened weekly gatherings of the town's 17 clerics, the setting for the two-hour meeting rotating among the mosques. They have dealt with U.S. raids in Thuluya, sectarian strife in nearby Balad, with its mixed Shiite-Sunni population, and efforts to refurbish the mosques.

His message is harsh -- opposing the American occupation, defending Sunnis against Shiites.

Some worshipers recall a sermon Khalil delivered last month in which he spoke of three men competing to be the most vile. The first saw a woman carrying wood atop her head. He beat her. The second tore off her clothes and raped her. The third stood back. When the other two asked what he would do to prove his wickedness, he laughed. That was my mother, he said.

As the mosque fell silent, Khalil said the mother represented Iraq, and the men were those who betrayed the country.

""The occupation is like a cancer, and it has to be removed,"" he said. The clerics, he said, ""are fighting with our tongues.""

On this day, Khalil expounded on the need to form a Sunni militia to offset the armed presence of Shiites and Kurds. He said former military officers had started recruiting in Thuluya -- in his view, a welcome development.

""If you lose and cannot get a place in the government, you have something to fight with,"" said Nadhim, wearing a white skullcap. . ""It's something to create a balance of power.""

The future, he predicted, was grim. He saw no end to the occupation. He saw sectarian strife only mounting.

""The seeds for civil war have been planted,"" he said, his tone matter of fact. ""I really think so."""
101,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"Medna Bayrakova remembers the day a middle-aged woman showed up at her door and asked to speak to her 26-year-old daughter. They shut themselves in the bedroom for half an hour, and then her daughter left, saying she was walking the visitor to the bus stop.

An hour later, Zareta still hadn't returned and several men in camouflage knocked at the door of the family's ravaged apartment in this ruined Chechen capital.

""We have taken away your daughter. She has agreed to marry one of our men,"" one said.

Bayrakova protested. ""She's a sick girl. She has tuberculosis. She was coughing up blood only this morning.""

""We will cure her,"" they replied quietly.

The next time Bayrakova and her husband saw their daughter's face, it was 24 days later -- separatist Chechen rebels had seized Moscow's Dubrovka Theater, along with 800 hostages. Zareta's unmistakable dark eyes were visible above a black veil on the television screen. Her fingers were clasped below a belt of powerful explosives.

There was one last view, this one a postmortem photo taken after federal agents gassed and stormed the theater in the early morning hours of Oct. 26, 2002, leaving all 41 hostage-takers and 129 of the captives dead. This time, Zareta's face was swollen and bruised -- barely recognizable.

""They asked me, 'Is it your daughter?' "" Bayrakova said. ""But the face was all smashed. She looked all beaten up. And then I passed out.""

In strapping the explosives belt to her waist that fall day in 2002, Zareta Bayrakova joined the cult of the ""black widows,"" the female suicide bombers who have left much of Russia on wary watch for the mysterious, dark-eyed woman in a long fur coat who is believed to recruit them.

A nationwide alert has been issued for a middle-aged woman with a hooked nose and dark hair popularly known as ""Black Fatima,"" who has been identified as a recruiter for the women known as shahidas, or martyrs. The woman reportedly has been seen lurking on the edges of terrorist bombings during a decade of tensions between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Russian troops pulled out of the republic after a disastrous 1994-96 war, and the mostly Muslim region exercises self-rule.

Seven women have launched suicide attacks against Israel, the first one in January 2002. By that time, Russia had already recorded two such attacks, and since then their numbers have grown. More than three dozen Chechen women -- roughly half of the suicide bombers -- have launched or attempted attacks against Russian targets since the second Chechen war began in 1999. Russian authorities say many appear to be dazed and under the influence of drugs; some would-be bombers have reported that they were forced by relatives in the Chechen resistance into attempting such attacks.

Most recently, on Dec. 9, a young woman blew herself up in front of Moscow's historic National Hotel, killing six people. An older woman in a dark coat and fur hat reportedly was seen slipping away from the scene. On Dec. 5, suicide bombers blew up a commuter train in the southern region of Stavropol, killing at least 44 others and injuring more than 150. Authorities said three women and one man were involved in the attack.

Nearly 150 people died in black-widow attacks last summer -- so named in the Russian media because many of the female perpetrators have lost husbands, brothers and fathers in the war in Chechnya.

Abu Walid, a Saudi national who is one of many Arabs who have joined the Chechen militants, is believed to be the commander of the rebels' eastern front in Chechnya. He recently explained the use of female suicide bombers in an interview with the Al Jazeera television network.

""These women, particularly the wives of the moujahedeen who are martyred, are being threatened in their homes. Their honor and everything are being threatened,"" he said. ""They do not accept being humiliated and living under occupation. They say that they want to serve the cause of almighty God and avenge the death of their husbands and persecuted people.""

Sergei Ignatchenko, spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service, said Arab militants ""have abused the idea of Chechnya's independence to suit their own ends.""

Chechen commander Shamil Basayev is said to have trained a force of up to 50 black widows for suicide attacks against Russian targets. Basayev claims to have masterminded several recent terrorist operations, including the Dubrovka Theater siege and the bombing at the National Hotel.

Meanwhile, the political leader of the separatists, Aslan Maskhadov, has repeatedly disavowed any connection with terrorism and even accused Russia's secret services of staging the Dubrovka siege for ""propaganda purposes."" But Russian security officials provided The Times with a videotape, dated Oct. 18, 2002 -- a week before the siege -- in which Maskhadov appeared to be referring to upcoming actions by Chechen rebels.

""We have practically accomplished a transition from guerrilla warfare to offensive combat operations,"" he says on the tape. ""I am convinced, and I do not have a shadow of a doubt on this, that during the concluding stage of our struggle, we will definitely hold an even more unique operation, similar to jihad. And with this operation, we will liberate our land from Russian aggressors.""

Another videotape, purportedly filmed at the same time, shows Maskhadov seated with Basayev, Abu Omar Seif -- an Islamic spiritual leader identified by the Russians as a link to Arab funding sources -- and Movsar Barayev, who led the hostage-takers at Dubrovka.

For the Russians, the tapes are proof that the moderate Chechen resistance, which has spoken out publicly against terrorism, is secretly organizing civilian terrorist operations. Russia has repeatedly sought to convince the U.S. that Moscow and Washington are facing the same enemy: the Al Qaeda terrorist network.

Maskhadov's aides have said he was talking about a strike against Russian military forces, not a terrorist act against civilians. And Chechen rebels say the Russians are ignoring the deep domestic rage that motivates suicide attacks.

""The Chechens do not have the right to stain with their blood the streets of Russian cities, which are rear bases of the aggressors' army?"" the Chechen separatist website, Kavkaz Center, asked sarcastically. ""A Russian tank driver, with intestines of Chechen children on its caterpillar track, and the pilot of a low-flying warplane shelling a bus with women and infants, are just unscrupulous uses of force, while a Chechen widow blowing herself up together with the pilots who have murdered her children is terrorism and cannot be justified.

""According to their logic, the Chechen nation must die magnanimously and in silence.""

On a quiet side street in the former Cossack village of Asinovskaya in western Chechnya, there is a pile of rubble that used to be Sulumbek Ganiyev's house. It is the house in which he raised six sons and four daughters.

Only four children are alive, two of whom are in captivity. Islam was killed in a rocket attack in 1999. Daughter Petimat disappeared in July 2000 and is believed to have died in a bombing raid in Grozny. Rustam, a former rebel fighter, is in prison in North Ossetia. Hussein was fighting with the rebels when he was killed in 2000. Raisa, who resisted being recruited by her brother as a black widow, is being held by the Russian secret services at an undisclosed location. The youngest son, Tarkhan, died in a car accident last spring.

Daughters Fatima and Khadzhad died in the Dubrovka Theater siege, with unused explosives belts strapped around their waists.

A few days after the Dubrovka standoff, the family says, Russian troops arrived in the early evening and, without so much as a knock on the door, blew up their house.

Ganiyev, a former builder, says he is alive today only because he and his wife were watching television next door.

""We are not to blame. Before the war, all the children were at home. The Russians took them away from us,"" Ganiyev said recently.

He said the family's first encounter with Russian troops was in October 1999, not long after the beginning of the second war, when soldiers entered the village and shot the Ganiyevs' five cows, tied two of the carcasses to their vehicle and left.

In July 2000, he said, troops entered their home at gunpoint, stole their videocassette recorder, lambs and chickens, and threw a grenade into the cellar where goods for the winter were stored.

Not long after, Rustam and Hussein began fighting for the rebels. Russian soldiers came to the door in June 2002 and grabbed Tarkhan, then 21, Fatima, 23, and Raisa, 17. Ganiyev remembers daughter Khadzhad, 14, shouting defiantly, as her three siblings are being led away: ""Are you really brave, when you take away girls?""

""They wanted to take her away, too, but her mother jumped in and prevented them,"" Ganiyev recalled.

For three agonizing days, the family knew nothing. Finally, Ganiyev said, he was able to negotiate a $1,000 ransom for his children's release. But when they came home, he says, they were different. ""After that, the girls understood that they will never be in peace,"" he said.

""They were very angry,"" added his wife, Lyuba. ""Otherwise, could you expect them to go to Moscow and take this death?""

Their daughters told them that they had been taken to a shed and that sometime later their brother, tied at the legs and hands and badly beaten, was thrown at their feet ""like a dead body."" The soldiers poured a bucket of water on him to awaken him and then led him away again.

""They tortured the girls with electric current. They put a metal spiral on their fingers and attached it to a current source, and they shocked them until they passed out,"" Ganiyev said. ""They wanted to get information about what bandits they know, who are the rebels.""

Lyuba Ganiyev tried to explain what drove Fatima, a law student who often helped her father bale hay, and Khadzhad, who had hoped to become a gynecologist, to join the terrorists in Moscow -- and Raisa, who eventually turned herself in to Russian authorities, to nearly follow them.

""After they beat them for three days, they had had enough. They came back and said, 'We are now in shame. They held us for three days. We can't live like this anymore.' It's not that they were crying. We never saw them crying. They were just sitting down, depressed.""

On Sept. 29, 2002 -- the same day Zareta Bayrakova disappeared -- Fatima and Khadzhad left home, saying they were going to Dagestan to see their nephew. They never returned. Their parents next saw them, as Medna Bayrakova had seen her daughter, a month later in television footage of the Dubrovka siege.

""They didn't tell us,"" Ganiyev said. ""If we had known, we wouldn't have let them. I would have broken their legs to stop them.""

Some witnesses said they saw two women walking together just before the bombing at the National Hotel in the heart of Moscow in December.

""So, where is your parliament?"" one of them asked. Then, the explosion. One witness said he saw a woman in a long coat fall to the pavement, get up and walk briskly away. Authorities believe that the woman may have been Black Fatima.

The bombing on the edge of Red Square crossed a red line of sorts for many Muscovites.

""Maybe they are doing this out of religious convictions, but I think it's against our God and against the soul of every human being. No normal woman would be likely to do this,"" said Tatyana Yezhova, a 19-year-old medical student injured in the bombing.

Many Russians see Chechnya's drive for independence as an assault on the nation's territorial integrity, and the carnage wrought by terrorists has only reinforced their support for President Vladimir V. Putin's war in the breakaway republic.

Russia has been widely criticized for atrocities and human rights violations -- Chechen men and women have been regularly kidnapped from their homes, tortured and even killed -- but the Russian public sees a military body count that often reaches half a dozen a day, as soldiers are ambushed in the hills or blown up by roadside explosive devices.

Chechen terrorists have attacked rock concerts, subway stations and commuter trains full of students. At the National Hotel, horrified witnesses described seeing severed heads and limbs strewn on the sidewalk. Others waited in fear for the next strike.

""We were immediately told on the radio that we should stand here and watch very, very carefully over the people who come here, because there was information that there are three other suicide bombers. So I am standing here breaking my eyes over everybody who comes in here,"" Yevgeny Petrov, a 23-year-old security guard, said as he anxiously watched passersby at a shopping center across the street on the morning of the hotel bombing.

""They told us they are women, and they will be constantly talking on the phone, as if somebody is hypnotizing them. Or we should look people in the eye, because their eyes will be weird, as if they are drugged,"" he said. ""It's very scary. How can you uncover a terrorist if she looks like everybody else?""

After the hotel bombing, a composite drawing was distributed, purported to be a likeness of Black Fatima. By then, everyone in Moscow knew who she was, mostly thanks to Zarema Muzhikhoyeva, a would-be black widow who last July set out to blow herself up at a restaurant on Moscow's Tverskaya Street.

The 23-year-old resident of Chechnya was stopped by security guards, but her bomb later detonated accidentally and killed a Russian policeman trying to defuse it.

Muzhikhoyeva, whose husband was killed fighting the war while she was pregnant with their daughter, told her interrogators that she had been ""a virtual slave"" to rebels who convinced her that it was her religious duty to go to Moscow and detonate a bomb at a cafe on busy Tverskaya Street. Investigators told the Moscow paper Kommersant that a woman Muzhikhoyeva knew as Lyuba -- Black Fatima -- took her to a house near Moscow and visited her frequently during the next week. She told police that Lyuba often gave her orange juice that made her dizzy and gave her a headache.

On the last day, she said, Lyuba gave her more juice, handed her a rucksack containing a bomb and showed her how to set it off.

In a jailhouse interview published Tuesday in the newspaper Izvestia, Muzhikhoyeva said two Chechen men prepared her for the task and dropped her off near the cafe. After being confronted by three men, she said, she went back on the street.

She said she had already decided not to pull the switch but feared that her trainers would set it off by remote control.

""Neither I nor they knew what to do,"" she said. ""I was walking along, waiting for death.""

Finally, a police officer approached and ordered her to drop her bag.

""I carried out the command and stepped away from this terrible bag,"" she said.

Alexei Zakharov, who heads Moscow's Research and Applied Science Center and specializes in the psychology of extreme situations, has interviewed would-be black widows in Russian custody and said many have reported having been drugged. All, he said, demonstrated signs of mental trauma.

The fact that they often are literally widows is telling, he said, because of a sense that they have become a burden on their husbands' families.

""Sometimes these women are told: 'You've been a sinner all your life. Allah punished you by taking your husband. Now it's time to restore yourself by doing your duty.' ""

Zakharov says he has seen evidence of brainwashing techniques, in which religious phrases in Arabic are recited repeatedly. ""They're gathered in large auditoriums, and they repeat a combination of sounds whose meaning they have no idea of. At the same time, they're making very rhythmic body motions. That, in fact, is one of the simplest and most primitive entrancing technologies.""

In Grozny, whatever understanding exists of suicide bombers appears to be more instinctive than scientific.

""You must either feel terribly bad to want to kill yourself, and others in the bargain, or you must be a complete lunatic. And when you see everything that's happened around here, you know the number of lunatics has increased,"" said Zarema Sadulayeva, an activist with the group Save the Generation in Grozny, which works to promote the welfare of Chechen youths.

In a region where large numbers of men have either joined the rebels or fled the country to avoid arrest by the Russians, women have taken on new roles, many said.

They are the teachers trying to keep the schools open when there is no electricity. They are the mothers standing each Monday outside the Russian government headquarters, demanding to know what has happened to their missing sons. They are the stooped shoulders hauling buckets of water up shattered stairways to 10th-floor apartments.

And some of them are suicide bombers.

""We know now that we can take care of ourselves. But nevertheless, it's difficult. Very difficult. We are suffering every minute,"" said Fatima Shabazova, 37, who lives in a war-battered apartment building with 12 other Chechen war widows.

""Men die on us. And we have to be strong. We just have to be,"" she said. ""Otherwise, we won't survive."""
102,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"The early Russian jazz scene is most memorably explained by the night in 1941 when Eddie Rosner, known for his take-no-prisoners version of ""St. Louis Blues"" and for being able to play two trumpets at the same time, was called on to perform for Josef Stalin in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi. For two hours, the band swung and grooved and played its heart out, and when it was over, the house lights went up on an empty theater.

Had he heard? Was he pleased? Did Stalin have a boogie soul? A phone call came from the Kremlin the next morning: The Soviet leader had enjoyed the performance. Rosner was able to play for five more years before being banished, with a good number of other artists -- especially artists who played counterrevolutionary Amerikansky dzhazz -- to a Soviet penal camp.

Then during the years after World War II, when Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were jamming a new path to bebop in smoky, after-hours New York, saxophones were confiscated in some quarters of Moscow and songs like ""Take the A Train"" were scratched off concert playlists by the Ministry of Culture.

Even 20 years later, when Moscow's first jazz clubs had opened, Benny Goodman had toured five Soviet cities and the jazz festival scene in Estonia was thriving, there was a parable familiar to every Soviet citizen: ""Today he's playing jazz. And tomorrow, he will sell the Motherland.""

Against this backdrop stands the Russian State Chamber Orchestra of Jazz Music, popularly known as the Oleg Lundstrem Orchestra. Thanks to Lundstrem, an 87-year-old pianist, bandleader, composer and all-around jazzman, the orchestra can make a claim to being the oldest jazz band in the world.

Lundstrem is Russia's answer to Count Basie.

Basie has passed away and only his name presides over his band today, but Lundstrem is still on the scene, overseeing the artistic direction of his orchestra, and still, when his health is good enough that he can drive in from his dacha north of Moscow, tipping his baton.

Before a sold-out house of 1,900 at the Grand Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on Feb. 2, Lundstrem celebrated receiving one of Russia's most prestigious artistic recognitions, the Triumph Prize, and led the band in the first of a series of 70-year anniversary performances with a swinging rendition of Duke Ellington's decidedly Amerikansky ""Old Circus Train Turn-Around Blues.""

Lundstrem has never felt the need to apologize for his embrace of an American art form. Clad during his increasingly rare performances in an elegant tuxedo, with a shock of white hair and a debonair mustache, Lundstrem has an easy banter with audiences and, one suspects, would have been as comfortable in the Waldorf-Astoria as the sprawling old Rossia Hotel.

""Americans recognize three musicians as great American musicians: Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Stan Kenton. And I think they're absolutely right,"" Lundstrem said recently. ""Those three made me one of the biggest bands in the world. I've always been aware of the fact that jazz was born in the United States.""

The Soviet Politburo also was aware. But even though jazz took its share of hits during the 1930s and 1940s -- the Soviet cultural revolutionaries went so far as to ban American jazz standards and other compositions built on flatted fifths and ""blue notes,"" characteristic of the genre -- it has always been irrepressible. Soviet army officers smuggled in records from West Berlin, and the Russian public took to the music enthusiastically.

Soviet jazz bands played to packed houses through the late 1950s, '60s and '70s, and Leningrad and Arkhangelsk, in the far north, became important intellectual centers of improvisational jazz. The music of Rosner, Alexander Tsfasman and Leonid Utesov still have devoted followings among the old babushka set, and today, Russian jazz musicians such as Igor Butman, Alexei Kozlov and Oleg Kireyev have international reputations and a domestic following large enough to pack Moscow nightclubs Le Club and the old Bluebird.

One night last month, people were turned away at the door for a standing-room-only tribute to Rosner at the Central House of Artists.

""I still have all the records recorded by our Soviet jazzmen, even though the Soviet leaders were saying things like jazz being the music of the fat people,"" Vladimir Tsoglin, a 79-year-old retired architect, said after the show.

""We recognized this as total stupidity. The literate people who love music -- and we have to say people do love music in this country, all sorts -- they loved jazz too.... Jazz is a joyful music.""

Modern-day jazz fans often see Lundstrem as a dinosaur of the Soviet era whose easy-listening arrangements survived because they were less threatening -- and less interesting -- than the late Soviet era's jazz avant-garde.

""The advocates of a more 'serious' jazz consider him a kind of a joke.... Since I developed an interest in jazz, sometime in the '70s, Lundstrem has remained unchanged: a static, almost motionless figure with a ludicrous conductor's baton in his hand, presiding over the bland, tame, unadventurous orchestra -- an embodiment of everything alien to the innovative, improvising spirit of jazz,"" said Alexander Kan, who for years organized a new-music festival in St. Petersburg and now hosts a world music program for the BBC.

""However, paradoxically, he is treated with respect. And I share that respect,"" Kan added. ""He has managed to live and preserve the orchestra and its dedication to jazz through the horrific Stalin years -- quite a heroic achievement in itself.""

The fact is that Lundstrem presided over what was considered for three decades the No. 1 jazz orchestra in the Soviet Union. With sophisticated, uniquely Russian arrangements of jazz standards and unusual jazz arrangements of Russian folk classics, ""this orchestra was probably one of the most progressive big bands in Europe in the 1970s,"" said Kyril Moshkov, managing editor of Moscow's jazz.ru Web portal.

""Look at 'Rhapsody in Blue,' "" Moscow jazz concert promoter Maya Kochubeyeva said of the George Gershwin composition. ""I caught myself thinking it was much more pleasant for me to listen to when Lundstrem was conducting it as opposed to when ... an American was conducting.

""The American musicians are more sort of energetic, more pushy, but they've got no heart to their music, whereas Russian musicians have a soul. And even now when Lundstrem is conducting, and he's an elderly person now, it's like a miracle. Because when they are playing, they play with their hearts.""

For the last year, the Oleg Lundstrem Orchestra has been conducted by Russian saxophonist and band leader Georgy Garanian. He is preparing the ensemble for a Count Basie retrospective in honor of the 100th anniversary of Basie's birth, and the Oleg Lundstrem band's 70th year, on March 23 at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall.

Garanian sees the band's closest musical equivalent as Duke Ellington, saying, ""Oleg had his own style, but it was clearly noticeable as soon as you heard Oleg Lundstrem that he adored Duke Ellington.""

In fact, it was Ellington who changed the course of Lundstrem's life and diverted him from his plan to be a railroad engineer, like his father, who had moved the family to the Manchurian city of Harbin to work on the Great Chinese Railroad.

Sitting in his small, rustic dacha one recent afternoon -- an old burgundy satin smoking jacket keeping off the winter chill, a biography of friend and idol Dmitri Shostakovich on his side table -- Lundstrem remembered going to the record store in Harbin one day in 1929 to pick up some new foxtrot tunes for a dance party.

He took one into the listening booth, and, as he tells it, ""it was love at first sight."" The record was Ellington's ""Dear Old Southland.""

""I was really staggered. And dumbfounded. I rushed out of the booth like a bullet out of a barrel.... We all gathered around the Victrola and put it on. And every single person had their jaw drop on the floor. My friends said, 'What is this?' It was 42 years between that moment and when Duke Ellington came to Russia.""

Lundstrem, his brother Igor, a saxophonist, and several friends started up the jazz band in 1934, with Oleg as piano man and bandleader. Two years later they moved to Shanghai, signed on as the house band at the prestigious Paramount Ballroom and became the most popular swing band in that wartime city. After the war, they boarded a steamship bound for Russia, looking for a place to settle in their homeland.

S. Frederick Starr, in his book ""Red and Hot: The Fate of Jazz in the Soviet Union,"" says Lundstrem's band headed straight to the Metropol Restaurant in Moscow and put on a jazz show. This was 1948, in the heat of the postwar crackdown on all things American, especially jazz. A scandal ensued, Starr says, and the Lundstrem band was banished to Kazan, the capital of the republic of Tatarstan.

Lundstrem, who has made a successful career out of skirting difficult political debates, says the group went to Kazan of its own accord.

""We didn't try to convince anybody of anything. We just arrived,"" he said. ""And we figured while they figure out whether this nation needs jazz music or not, we'll get an education. We decided there was no point in arguing with Maxim Gorky [who had declared that jazz was 'music for fat cats.'] We knew that life would sort things out.""

Lundstrem began listening to old Tatar folk melodies and -- for the pure challenge and fun of it -- turning them into complex jazz arrangements. A Georgian lullaby he overheard in a restaurant became one of his most famous recordings, the haunting ""In Georgian Mountains.""

Lundstrem figured it was his duty as a musician to creatively process the sounds around him.

""I'm a great fan of the words of Mikhail Glinka, the first Russian composer whom Europe discovered. Glinka said that music is composed by the people, and we composers simply arrange the music. And I believe the greatest thing that all the nations have created is their folklore.""

This was music even Stalin could love. And down in Kazan, who cared that Lundstrem was also spinning arrangements of Glenn Miller, Fletcher Henderson and Ellington?

Mainstream jazz was rehabilitated after Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev's gassy stomach notwithstanding. Shostakovich, then head of the composers' union, listened to Lundstrem's recordings and liked them.

""He said, 'There's no need to argue. This is a living example of what our own Russian jazz should sound like,' "" Lundstrem recalled.

(Later, when Lundstrem visited Shostakovich's home, the composer's son began entertaining them with boogie-woogie blues on the piano. ""That's your influence,"" Shostakovich said with a shake of his head. ""But I'm not against it."")

The band was invited to Moscow and on Oct. 1, 1956, Lundstrem was designated director of the state jazz orchestra. The band eventually toured 300 Russian cities and dozens abroad, including Santa Barbara for its 1999 jazz festival.

Jazz, at least Lundstrem-style jazz, had become politically correct.

From the beginning, jazz scholar Alexey Batashev said, the Soviet system was of two minds about jazz. On the one hand, it was reprehensibly American. On the other, some suggested it was a good kind of American, because it had originated with African Americans.

""The American communists suggested the idea that jazz music had proletarian roots, and was revolutionary, and that it was possible to make a revolution in the U.S.A. where the Southern states would decide to join the U.S.S.R.,"" Batashev said. Black American artists such as Paul Robeson and Langston Hughes were welcomed in Russia, he said, because Soviet authorities believed they shared a natural kinship and could help spread the message of communism in the United States.

Lundstrem has his own philosophy, which he says he applies to his life as much as his music. ""The Chinese say the movement forward is the movement toward eternity. The movement backward is the movement against eternity.

""Having realized that we're just a tiny particle of the overall universe, we should all preoccupy ourselves with only one thing: Move forward. Because should we move backward, eternity will smack us in the head so hard we will never regain consciousness."""
103,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"Zalina Dzandarova cradles her son Alan as he sleeps with his small face buried against her stomach. He is the child Dzandarova was able to save. The child she chose to save, really.

It is the other one, little Alana, her 6-year-old daughter, whose image torments her: Alana clutching her hand, Alana crying and calling after her. Alana's sobs disappearing into the distance as Dzandarova walked out of Middle School No. 1 here Thursday, clutching 2-year-old Alan in her arms.

Guerrillas armed with automatic rifles and explosive belts who are holding hundreds of hostages at the small provincial school in southern Russia allowed 26 women and children to leave. About a dozen mothers, like Dzandarova, were allowed to take only one child, forced to leave another behind.

""I didn't want to make this choice,"" a stunned-looking Dzandarova, 27, said in the reception room of her father-in-law's house a few miles from the school. ""People say they are happy that my son and I are saved. But how can I be happy if my daughter's still inside there?""

Violence often selects its victims randomly, but seldom is a mother asked to make a Sophie's choice: Save one child and leave behind another, possibly to face death. The standoff in North Ossetia republic involving about 20 guerrillas -- most likely linked to the neighboring separatist republic of Chechnya or adjacent Ingushetia -- has stunned a nation accustomed to war and its horrors after the many ethnic and territorial conflicts that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Even with the downing of two Russian jetliners and two street bombings coming in just one week, the thought of schoolchildren surrounded by veiled female suicide bombers and masked guerrillas has traumatized the country. ""They Have Taken Hundreds of Our Children,"" read a banner headline in the daily newspaper Izvestia.

And they took Alana.

""They said they would let us go only after the [Russian] troops are withdrawn from Chechnya,"" said Dzandarova. She said the attackers had identified themselves as Chechens. ""I said we have nothing to do with that, but they wouldn't listen.""

Her description provided one of the first accounts of what was happening inside the school, where Dzandarova said as many as 1,000 children and parents were being held in a gymnasium planted with explosives. Authorities officially listed the number of hostages at 354, a figure Dzandarova disputed.

""The director of the school was taken to a TV where they were saying there were 354 of us in here, and the director came back and she was in a state of shock, because there were in fact many more people there,"" she said.

""There were definitely 1,000 people in that one room,"" she said, referring to the gym. ""I saw it with my own eyes.""

On Wednesday, Dzandarova took her daughter to the first day of first grade. As students and parents began lining up, they saw the attackers sweeping into the school. Dzandarova ran with her children to hide in a classroom, but they were rounded up with the others and taken to the gym.

""Everyone was ordered to sit down, and they began to set up booby-traps around the perimeter, right in front of our eyes. They had lots of guns and explosives with them.""

At first, she said, everyone was allowed to drink water from the tap. But the hostage-takers soon stopped that, she said, because they were angry that officials, including the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, had not come to meet with them.

Without water, the powdered milk the guerrillas supplied for the children had to be spooned into their mouths.

The gym was sweltering, even after the window panes were broken out.

""They were telling us, 'Your government is not allowing enough water for your kids.' ""

In just two days, she said, the problem became acute. ""You see, the kids won't survive these negotiations,"" she said. ""They're not getting enough water. What we have to hope is that they'll survive this night without water.""

At the beginning, 20 men in the gym were led to a different room. On Thursday, Dzandarova said, 10 of the men returned. The hostages presumed that the others were dead.

""They told us that it was 'your own side' that had executed them, who had shot them dead,"" Dzandarova said.

Two women who had been wearing suicide belts apparently detonated them Wednesday in an adjoining room, she said.

""They left the gym, and all of a sudden we heard two loud explosions. We thought the storming [by Russian police] had begun. But then they told us, 'Our sisters have won a victory, and there's no other cause they want to pursue.' ""

The male guerrillas, she said, ""took it calmly.""

Much of the time, she said, the guerrillas appeared tense: running around the room, waving their guns in the hostages' faces, shouting at them to sit still and stop talking.

When Alan began to cry from hunger, Dzandarova was allowed to join several other mothers in an adjacent room, which had its own water and was several degrees cooler.

After a former local political leader visited the school Thursday, the women in the adjacent room were told there was ""good news"": They would be released.

""They said, 'Pack your things quickly, and take your babies with you,' "" Dzandarova said.

Shortly after, she learned that she would have to choose between taking her son or her daughter.

Dzandarova had both Alan and Alana with her and made a snap decision to pass Alana to her 16-year-old sister-in-law. But the guerrillas saw through the ruse and refused to allow her to take the older child.

""Alana was clinging to me and holding my hand firmly. But they separated us, and said: 'You go with the boy. Your sister can stay here with her.' I cried. I begged them. Alana cried. The women around us wept. One of the Chechens said: 'If you don't go now, you don't go at all. You stay here with your children ... and we will shoot all of you.' ""

She couldn't save both of them. She could only die with both of them -- or save one of them and herself.

""I didn't have time to think what I was doing,"" she said. ""I pressed Alan even stronger to myself, and I went out, and I heard all the time how my daughter was crying and calling for me behind my back. I thought my heart would break into pieces there and then.""

Dzandarova cried as she talked. Her tears fell on Alan, who was sleeping. Even when his mother shook quietly with sobs as she cradled him, he didn't awaken."
104,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"A three-day school hostage ordeal ended in bloodshed and pandemonium Friday when explosions tore apart the gym where more than 1,000 captives were being held, touching off an assault by Russian commandos and fierce gun battles in surrounding streets.

The official death toll was at least 250; more than 100 of the dead were children. In addition, 700 people were injured.

The explosions, apparently set off unintentionally by the hostage-takers, turned the gymnasium into a mass of twisted metal, shattered bones and charred flesh, with at least 100 bodies scattered on the floor. After the blasts, half-naked children weak with thirst, many covered in blood, ran crying from the burning building with their captors in pursuit.

""We were sitting next to the window and talking to each other. And then there were these two explosions. It deafened us, and as soon as the explosions sounded, the entire gym, the floors, the walls and the ceiling, were covered in blood,"" said Zaur Aboyev, 16. ""And I knew it was time to run.""

As Russian forces stormed the school complex and hunted for the hostage-takers, some of whom had fled, the sounds of battle filled this small Caucasian town in the Russian republic of North Ossetia for hours.

Russian officials said they had killed 20 hostage-takers, arrested three and believed three others were at large. A furious mob killed at least one man they believed to be a hostage-taker.

""Today has only brought death, nothing else,"" said Rimma Gazzayeva, who helped drag corpses -- possibly of people caught in the crossfire -- off the streets.

The militants who seized the school Wednesday, the first day of classes, were believed to be separatists from the nearby republic of Chechnya. Guerrillas in that republic have been fighting for independence from Russia for a decade.

The violent end to the 56-hour crisis stunned a nation in which a series of major terrorist attacks believed linked to Chechen separatists have killed about 370 people in the last two weeks. In addition to the school takeover, 90 people died in near-simultaneous downings of two airliners, a suicide bomber killed nine near a Moscow subway station, and militant attacks on police and government police in Chechnya's capital left at least 19 dead.

The events have renewed pressure on Russian President Vladimir V. Putin to resolve the situation in Chechnya, where two wars in 10 years have virtually leveled the capital, left thousands dead and brought international condemnation upon Russia for extensive human rights abuses by its soldiers.

Putin made no public statement about the bloody end of the standoff Friday.

Early today, the president visited survivors in Beslan's hospital. Television showed him standing stiffly as he patted a patient's arm.

Putin has long contended that Arab terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, have played a role in the violence in Chechnya, where a majority of people are Muslim. Russia's Federal Security Service reported that 10 of the hostage-takers at the school were Arabs, which if substantiated would boost Putin's assertions.

Russian authorities said Friday that they believed the siege had been masterminded by Chechnya's most notorious warlord, Shamil Basayev, an Islamic militant whose funding channels are believed to be linked to Al Qaeda.

President Bush condemned the bloodshed. ""This is yet another grim reminder of the lengths to which terrorists will go to threaten the civilized world,"" he told a campaign rally in Wisconsin.

Hostages described three days of sweltering heat in the crowded gym with little food and less water. Many said they had drunk urine from their own shoes and chewed the leaves of school plants to relieve their thirst.

One boy, 10-year-old Stanislav Tsarakhov, said another boy was so thirsty he approached one of the hostage-takers who was holding an assault rifle with a bayonet attached.

""The boy went to him and asked for a little water, and instead of giving him water, he drove his bayonet through the boy's body,"" Tsarakhov said. ""I don't know if he died.""

Tsarakhov's life may have been saved when a woman he had never met threw herself on top of him after the first big explosion, shielding him from the second. It is not known what happened to the woman.

The captives described three days of terror as the hostage-takers fired guns into the air to silence the children's constant crying.

""They didn't allow us to sleep. They kept us awake all the time. They would pour our own urine on our heads,"" said Arsen Khasigov, 11, whose mother had accompanied him to the school on Wednesday and was also taken captive.

""I got out because my mom threw me out the window,"" he said. ""She's in the hospital now because some concrete blocks fell on her head. But she pushed me out of the window.""

""The kids were crying all the time, almost all of them,"" said Serafima Bekoyeva, 44, a kindergarten teacher who had been held hostage with her two sons. ""Because they were hungry. And how would you react if you were held by people who were waving their guns in your face and shouting at you, 'Shut up, you pigs!' ... They kept demanding that the kids stop crying, but how can you keep your kids quiet in such a situation? So they would start firing their guns in the air.""

Russian authorities emphasized that they had not planned to storm the school and had been hoping to continue negotiations. But the situation spun out of control about 1 p.m., when a team arrived under an agreement with the hostage-takers to remove seven bodies that had lain in the courtyard since Wednesday.

""A blast came from inside the school just when rescuers were removing victims' bodies. Several more blasts closely followed in the heavily mined premises,"" said Valery Andreyev, head of the Federal Security Service in North Ossetia.

It is unclear what triggered the initial explosion. The leading theory is that one of the hostage-takers accidentally set off a booby trap, but some hostages suggested that an explosive fell off a basketball hoop in the gym. Others said a trip wire that had been taped to a wall was dislodged.

In any case, with many of the explosives electrically linked, the first blast set off at least one other, touching off a fire and causing the roof of the gym to collapse. About 30 hostages began leaping for the open windows to escape and their captors pursued them, shooting and battering them with their rifle butts.

The unexpected explosions and gunfire caused Russian commandos surrounding the school to open fire on the hostage-takers, and chaos ensued.

""I don't even realize to this moment how I managed to escape,"" said Bekoyeva, the kindergarten teacher. ""There were deafening blasts all around us, and it was impossible to tell where they were coming from. We immediately started to push kids out the windows.""

Hostages described running through intense gunfire and hiding in outbuildings before reaching a police command post.

""It looked very much like the terrorists were firing on the kids,"" said Aleksandr Zakaidza, who watched from nearby. Some of those hiding in a nearby building started calling for help. ""They were saying, 'Mama, Papa, help us, we're here.' ""

Tsarakhov, the 10-year-old boy, said he had been hiding behind some garages when a black Mercedes stopped.

""A man got out, just grabbed me and threw me in the car. He said, 'Where are you going?' I said, 'I'm going home.' He said, 'No, you're not.' And he took me to the hospital.""

As the gunfights raged, the hostage-takers split into three groups and two of them drifted or fought their way into the surrounding, heavily congested neighborhood. Russian forces battled them among occupied apartment buildings as thousands of bystanders watched.

At Beslan's only hospital, ambulance after ambulance roared up the driveway and nearly collided with one of dozens of hurtling passenger cars that were delivering victims.

Fathers roamed the streets nearby carrying their nearly naked and sometimes blood-speckled children. Many of the children had apparently taken off much of their clothing because of the stifling heat in the gym.

A makeshift morgue nearby was a scene of intense grieving, as burned and broken bodies -- many of them tiny -- were brought in and laid out briefly for identification. The sound of wailing engulfed the hospital grounds, as men and women alike dropped to their knees, clutched their heads and wept.

Inside the morgue, a middle-aged man with his arms covered in blood up to his elbows helped load bodies onto stretchers for transport. At one point, a jaw fell off with a click onto the tile floor. He picked it up and gazed dumbstruck at the crowd, a cigarette in his mouth and tears streaming down his face. Then he quietly placed the jaw next to the rest of the body and continued his work.

Closer to the school, Russian troops and police battled the militants for much of the afternoon, and the boom of tank fire occasionally sounded a bass note underneath the constant rhythm of small-arms volleys.

""Some of them managed to escape from the school. But the area is cordoned off, and they don't have a chance,"" said one police officer attempting to keep hundreds of curious civilians away from the fighting.

But a senior lieutenant with the Defense Ministry troops appeared less confident.

""Nobody really knows how many fighters escaped,"" he said, adding that there were reports that some militants had dressed in civilian or medical personnel clothing. ""God knows where these people are now. If we don't manage to snatch them out by dark, we're [in trouble].""

The speaker of the local parliament, Taimuraz Mamsurov, called on the public to ""break into groups, take radios and mop up your living quarters -- stop every man who doesn't live in that quarter."" Within hours, the streets were filled with civilians toting their own rifles.

A few blocks from the school, a man thought to be a fighter was killed by a mob shortly after he was arrested, witnesses said.

""You could look at his face and see he was not an ordinary person. Everything he was wearing was black, and he had a long beard,"" said Vyacheslav Kudukhov, a witness. The man, he said, ""kept yelling, 'I'm a correspondent!' But everyone knew he was lying.""

""The crowd grabbed him. The police managed to seize him for a short time, but while they were escorting him, at some point one of the local people who had a hunting rifle just shot the guy in the chest,"" said Tatyana Sagutonova, 22, a student.

The most intense battle continued to focus on the school, where about three hostage-takers remained with as many as 50 hostages until Russian forces overcame what appeared to be the last of them Friday evening.

""As of 11:30 p.m., the resistance of the terrorists at the school in Beslan is completely suppressed,"" operation spokesman Lev Dzugayev said.

Around Beslan, citizens who had been on vigil in the streets for three straight days returned to their homes in bitterness.

""We expected this to happen,"" said Valentina Sagutonova, a retired policewoman, referring to the standoff's end. ""We just hoped it would happen as soon as possible. These people cannot be treated in any other way. We've been living with them all our lives, and believe me, they can only be dealt with with brute force."""
105,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"It was 6 a.m. when Russian soldiers hoisted themselves over the wall, crashed through the window and broke down the front door. Their quarries were still asleep.

Shouting, shoving and kicking, the soldiers pushed 67-year-old Khavazh Semiyev and his wife into a truck waiting outside, then went back for the others -- his two sons and two nephews, his son's wife, his 52-year-old sister. Then -- and Semiyev couldn't believe his eyes -- they went back for his grandchildren: Mansur, 11 years old. Malkhazni, 9. And Mamed, 7.

They were driven in their nightclothes and socks through the empty early morning streets of Chechnya to the Russian army's command center at Khankala. There, the men were forced onto their knees with their heads on the ground. Sacks were pulled over their heads, and their hands were tied behind their backs. For the next 24 hours, anyone who moved from that position got kicked.

One day into the seizure of more than 1,000 hostages by suspected Chechen separatists in the town of Beslan, Russia now had its own hostages. Altogether, an estimated 40 family members of senior Chechen rebel leaders were assembled at Khankala from Thursday, a day after the hostage seizure in Beslan, until Saturday, the day after it ended.

Semiyev's daughter, Kusama, is the wife of Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov. Around Semiyev were suddenly assembled the entire extended families of Maskhadov, the former Chechen president, and of Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Doku Umarov. Maskhadov's brother was in the tent where the men were kept, and his elderly sister was in a nearby building with the women and children. A 5-month-old baby proved to be a distant relative of one of the rebel leaders.

""We figured they wanted to exchange us for the hostages in Beslan,"" Semiyev said in an interview at his home in this small town in northern Chechnya.

""They were trying to make the people of Chechnya feel as bad as the people in Beslan,"" said Liza Akhmadkhanova, a neighbor of Maskhadov's brother, Lyoma. ""They just hate Chechens. Whenever they have a chance to get back at us, they do.""

Officially, the Russian government says the seizures were meant to protect the families. A statement from operations headquarters in the northern Caucasus said Russian forces obtained intelligence that rebel leaders planned to kill several of their own relatives and then accuse Russian law enforcement bodies of murdering them.

The headquarters staff also said there was evidence that ""spontaneous groups"" were being formed in various areas of Chechnya to ""vent their anger"" at relatives of the rebel leaders, presumably over the events in Beslan.

""There was a colonel who spoke very eloquently, and everybody was afraid of him. He said we should thank fate and God for them having taken us away on time because Maskhadov and Basayev supposedly issued an order to have us taken into the building [at Beslan] and executed with the hostages,"" Semiyev said.

The family laughs wryly at this. ""If this was what he thought, he must be a total imbecile,"" said Aslanbek Semiyev, Khavazh's nephew, who was one of the detainees.

Maskhadov's spokesman in London, Akhmed Zakayev, said Russian authorities were trying to inspire terror in the terrorists -- though Maskhadov had vigorously denied involvement and condemned the hostage-taking.

""They were following the standard practice developed almost a century ago by the Bolsheviks and carried on by Stalin, who believed that every single act of terror should be responded to by an even bigger, more horrendous, more terrifying terrorist act,"" Zakayev said. ""According to this practice, it is necessary to shock terrorists, and let them know that under no condition will you agree to negotiate with them.""

Maskhadov's family members said they met many members of Basayev's family for the first time. ""There was a big elderly man I was talking to there,"" Semiyev said. ""We were trying to track down his relationship to Basayev. It turned out Basayev's aunt was married to him or something. We got lost in the family tree. But it was interesting after all this time to get to know them. We even hugged each other when we left.""

Across Chechnya, the reaction to the events in Beslan, where 335 hostages were killed and 700 injured, has been mixed. There has been pain on behalf of the victims, most of whom were children, and quiet resentment that the victims of Chechnya's two wars in 10 years with Russia have fewer mourners.

""Of course we feel sorry for the hostages in Beslan, but this is a situation that happens in Chechnya every day,"" said Buchu Abdul-Kadyrova, Maskhadov's sister, who was one of those detained last week.

Tabarik Gagayeva, who sells sunflower seeds in a market outside the Chechen capital, Grozny, said, ""I was sitting watching it on TV, and I was going out of my mind. I was thinking, what kind of people could do that? What kind of people could treat children like that?""

Gagayeva's husband disappeared in 1995, though his car was discovered demolished in an area where there had been a Russian military operation. Her two brothers and one brother's sister-in-law died the same year after troops in a Russian armored vehicle pulled over and asked about her brother's arm wound, which he had sustained from shrapnel during a bombing.

""They said, 'Oh, you must be a fighter, because you're wounded,' "" witnesses to the arrest told her. After that, she said, ""they killed them. They tortured them first. They cut off their legs at the knee and their arms. The girl they literally ripped from throat to bottom.

""So you can see that when I'm watching what happened in Beslan on TV, I remember what great pain happened in my own family. I remember this with great trepidation, and I cry.""

""It was a wrong thing to do. We don't approve of this at all,"" said Islam Islamov, a 27-year-old resident of the Chechen town of Turbino. ""The hostage-takers were talking about withdrawing Russian troops from Chechnya, but I don't think it would be a good idea at all to withdraw the troops. If that happens, this [republic's] really going to be a mess.""

But the arrest of the rebel leaders' families also drew a negative reaction, especially since at least two family members suffered broken bones and several others severe bruises from being beaten and kicked.

""They just nabbed some elderly grannies. What did they have to do with either the field commanders here or the hostages in Beslan?"" Magomed Akhmadov, 27, said. ""I think they did it out of hatred. I think they wanted to demonstrate that they were strong.""

Abdul-Kadyrova, 67, said Russian interrogators roughly asked her about her contacts with her brother, with whom she said she had not spoken since he was ousted from the presidency in 1999 and disappeared into the mountains to lead the rebels.

""There were people making very frightening comments about us [the family detainees] like, 'They should be turned into ashtrays.' I don't know what turning a person into an ashtray means, but it sounds very menacing,"" Abdul-Kadyrova said.

""Whenever there's a terrorist act, they say, 'Oh, there's Maskhadov's hand in this, there's a Chechen trail in it.' They know these lines so well they could recite them if you woke them up in the middle of the night,"" she said.

Most of the detainees said the Russians were seeking information about the possible perpetrators of the Beslan hostage-taking, but all said it was also clear that the arrests were a message to the rebel commanders: We know where your families are.

""There were people there 4 years old, babies, toddlers -- they simply wanted to keep us prisoners,"" Abdul-Kadyrova said. ""People were saying, 'Remember how [Russian President Vladimir V.] Putin gassed his own people in Moscow [during the rescue of hundreds of hostages at the Dubrovka Theater in 2002], that's what they're going to do to us now.'

""People were afraid. You know, the Russians can do anything.""

Abdul-Kadyrova said she was sure her brother would never have ordered the seizure of children as hostages.

At the same time, she said, she was sure that imprisoning his family would not affect his decisions on behalf of the separatist movement.

""My brother is fighting for Chechnya's independence. He wants the Chechen people to be free, he doesn't want them to be subordinate to Russia,"" she said. ""My brother will never give up his cause, and if he does, he cannot be considered a man anymore....

""My brother would rather kill all of us than give us over to the Russians."""
106,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"One might say that Vitaly Kozyrev is a man who has lost everything.

But he has not. Forty days after his wife, daughter and son died in a hostage seizure at the school near his home in southern Russia, Kozyrev still has his memories.

Piled on a bed in his parents' house is a jumble of mementos -- photographs, a scuffed soccer ball, his wife's elegant high-heeled shoes, her half-used shampoo bottles -- that are something like his thoughts. Sweet. Cutting to his soul. Fading so fast he has to collect them in a pile so they won't disappear.

As hundreds of mourners marked the end of 40 days of bereavement for Beslan's victims Tuesday, 331 by official count, Kozyrev stayed inside the house, disinclined to wade into the streets with other weeping families.

Still, neighbors came to him, stubborn in their support, quietly demanding in the tradition of the Caucasus that grief be shared communally, like the tasks of building a brick wall, or caring for children whose parents have gone to Moscow, or, as has happened too often in the last month, lowering the coffin of a neighbor's child into the grave.

Neighbors knocked insistently on Kozyrev's door, and when he let them in, he showed them this bed, piled high with treasures from a life that somehow got away from him. The Barbie doll, the ribbons, a brush still tangled with dark hair.

""It's been 40 days now, and I can understand that life goes on. But I don't understand how I'm supposed to do this,"" Kozyrev says, sitting in the chilly room as a soft rain drizzles outside the window. ""You tell me how I'm supposed to turn the page and move on. Because I simply don't understand how I'm supposed to do it.""

A picture of Ala, 34, looking as she did when she graduated from the university, hangs over the center of the bed. On the left is a photo of Elona, 12, with white ribbons in her hair; and on the right, Timur, 9, attempting to look old and serious.

All three were at Beslan Middle School No. 1 for the first day of the term on Sept. 1 when nearly three dozen attackers seized more than 1,000 hostages and held them for three days, before an apparently accidental blast set off a fatal volley of gunfire and explosions. An estimated 800 people are believed to have survived the assault.

Ala was an elementary-grade teacher at the school, and her children shone. Timur won the math Olympics last year.

Elona had the role of the fox in the school play last year. She competed in chess, and both she and Timur joined the ballroom dancing club for the fun and glamour of it.

She always insisted on standing up and proposing a toast on family holidays -- Kozyrev would let her have half a glass of champagne for the occasion -- and she always had the same toast.

""To our family,"" she would say, and talk about them always being healthy and together.

She was caught, Kozyrev remembered, between being his tomboy daughter and what she would become. ""I told her she needed to start behaving like a real young lady instead of climbing the trees and the fences. And she would say, 'You know, Papa, I'm still just a little kid.'

""And then she would come running to me and fling her arms around me and put her ear to my chest, and she would say, 'Your heart is beating like this' -- and she would make the sound of it with her lips....""

As he speaks, Kozyrev wipes a steady stream of tears with a neatly folded, plaid handkerchief. In a culture of Ossetian men known for their stern countenances and tough dispositions, he seems unashamed that his sentences often break into sobs. Each time his guests move to go, to leave him to his thoughts, he thinks of a new detail.

He had a job as an inspector at the gas company, he says, but when the family saved up enough money to buy a car not long ago, he started driving it nights as a taxi to put away money for the children's education. Still, he recalls, he'd try to come home early in the afternoons, and he'd never walk through the door without a Snickers bar or a bag of potato chips for each child in his pocket.

Ala caught him up on that not long ago.

""I'm your third child, Papa,"" she told him teasingly -- she always called him Papa after the kids were born -- and after that, Kozyrev would come home in the afternoon with three Snickers in his pocket.

What he remembers most about Ala is not what he gave her, but what she gave him. He never stirred his own tea, he says. Ala knew how many spoonfuls he wanted, and did it for him. ""I would wake up every day and head for the shower, and as I passed the kitchen, I'd see that breakfast was already laid out on the table,"" he says.

Timur never left the house with his shirt unironed. Ala carefully pressed the ribbons before tying them into Elona's hair.

""She had such a generous heart, that I kept thanking God that she had picked me,"" Kozyrev says. ""I can't even find the words to describe how happy I was.""

When it is suggested that he was a lucky man for having had these last 12 years, Kozyrev looks blank. ""Was,"" he says. ""Was.""

""There are millions of families in the world, and I do think ours was special. It was all woven in these little details, all of these things that, put together, made our family what it was. And it's impossible to forget these sweet, little details.""

These days, Kozyrev says he spends a lot of time sleeping, hoping he will dream of his wife and son and daughter. ""I just want to feel for one minute the way I felt before,"" he explains.

But although their images, lifeless, stare at him all day long in this room of mementos, their radiant smiles elude him in his sleep."
107,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"In a sunny garden outside the Kremlin, not far from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, workers quietly hammered into place 10 squat black letters to commemorate one of the bloodiest battles of World War II: Stalingrad.

Until Friday, the memorial bore the name the city has had since 1961 -- Volgograd -- reflecting modern Russia's reluctance to honor a Soviet dictator famed and feared for a legacy of repression. President Vladimir V. Putin had long resisted pleas by war veterans to correct the historical record, saying it ""could trigger suspicion that we are returning to the times of Stalinism.""

Then, without fanfare, the 10 new letters appeared on the wall, and below them, a bright wreath of autumn flowers. Coming just days after Putin announced one of the most sweeping consolidations of presidential power since the fall of communism, the move evoked far more than the memory of war.

""It is symbolic -- another step toward the restoration of the Soviet Union,"" said Lyudmila Alexeyeva, a former Soviet dissident and chairwoman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, a human rights organization.

As a chilly early autumn takes hold in Russia, there is a palpable sense of unease.

On the streets, people live in dread of the next terrorist attack, and in law enforcement circles, authorities flinch from the demonstrated inability of Russia's famed security services to protect the population. In the last few weeks, more than 400 people have been killed in bloodshed that has included a suicide bombing near a subway station, nearly simultaneous airline bombings and a hostage siege at a provincial school.

Opponents worry that Putin's response has had almost nothing to do with terrorism, and everything to do with expanding the already formidable power of the government.

Putin responded to the school tragedy by saying that the nation was ""weak -- and the weak get beaten,"" and by taking steps ""to ensure the unity of state power."" On Sept. 13, he announced a plan to eliminate the general election of regional governors and of independent seats in parliament, essentially removing the last real checks on his personal dominion over the largest nation on Earth.

As a result of these measures and others put into place over the last four years, the Kremlin now controls an absolute majority in parliament, all major television stations, the Russian gas giant Gazprom (which reportedly is positioning itself to acquire the private oil company Yukos), the country's corrupt judicial system and a massive state security apparatus.

""Putin is now past the point where his regime can be removed peacefully by democratic means. There is no way for democratic transition,"" said Vladimir Kara-Murza of the pro-democracy Committee 2008 organization. ""There's no independent media, there's no parliament to speak of, there are no real parliamentary elections and now with the decision about the regional governors, there are no elections at all.""

In an office at the parliament building Friday, one official broke from Russian into English and lowered his voice to barely a whisper, nodding his head toward the wall, as if it might be listening.

""Democracy is finished in this country,"" he said. ""It is over. It ended on the 13th of September.""

Asked whether his caution and pessimism were not extreme, he shook his head firmly. ""Many have already been given very severe and hard instructions,"" he said. ""Not to comment. Not to criticize. And real threats. All of us are in a state of shock. We are in the middle of 1937.""

Notes of concern have been raised by Putin's onetime mentor, the reclusive Boris N. Yeltsin, and by former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, both cautioning about the need to preserve democratic freedoms.

""The general impression is that everything will now rest on the president's shoulders. First of all, this is too great a burden for even the most superhuman politician,"" Gorbachev told the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. ""It is vital for the people themselves to participate in, oversee and receive information about the activities of the authorities. If their intention is to solve everything without the involvement of the people -- that is a delusion.""

Analysts said the move to appoint regional governors, with ratification by local legislatures, reflects concern over the growing militancy of some of Russia's far-flung regions. Oil-rich areas have grumbled loudly in the last year over Kremlin moves to substantially increase Moscow's share of oil profits; in July, 10 governors in the Russian Far East signed an unprecedented letter of opposition to Putin's plan to replace relatively generous Soviet-era in-kind benefits with meager cash payments.

In the wake of the president's Sept. 13 announcement, the Russian information agency, RIA Novosti, convened a panel of political analysts to help make Putin's case. They depicted Russia as a nation at war with terrorists, most linked to the southern republic of Chechnya, where Russia has battled with separatist rebels for most of the last 10 years.

""The main goal of the terrorists is to rock the state structure and to destabilize. So the retaliation must be to prevent them from doing this by ... strengthening the backbone and vertebrae of power,"" said Sergei Markov, a prominent political analyst with close ties to the Kremlin.

That the Russian leader has no intention of softening his often-quoted determination to ""wipe out"" separatist Chechen rebels ""in the outhouse"" was reaffirmed Friday.

""We must under no circumstances give in to the idea that by making concessions to criminals, we can gain anything, or hope that they will leave us in peace -- this will not happen,"" Putin declared.

Not long after his remarks, a regional amnesty commission recommended a pardon for a Russian officer, Col. Yuri Budanov, convicted in 2003 of kidnapping and murdering a Chechen woman -- a case widely seen as a referendum on Russian human rights abuses in Chechnya. Budanov, whose case must now be reviewed by Putin, had been sentenced to 10 years in prison.

""It is all the more symbolic that Budanov is pardoned now, immediately after Beslan,"" said Anna Politkovskaya, who covers Chechnya for Novaya Gazeta. ""It is like telling those who may be concerned, 'Watch out, guys like Budanov are out, and they're rolling their sleeves up.' ""

Putin has announced plans for stepped-up anti-terrorism efforts in the North Caucasus, but there has been almost universal agreement that law enforcement will remain an ineffective opponent as long as corruption remains endemic.

Suicide bombers who boarded the two airliners that exploded Aug. 24, killing all 90 aboard, were detained by airport police but allowed to board the planes after paying bribes -- one of as little as $34 -- to an airline employee, prosecutors said Thursday.

""The reason we are seeing this kind of terrorism on such a large scale is very simple: We created conditions for the security services and the law enforcement bodies in which they simply cannot be effective in performing their functions,"" said lawmaker Gennady Gudkov, a former officer of the FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB.

A widespread exodus of experienced officers during the 1990s, when salaries and prestige in the law enforcement structures plunged, left Russian law enforcement with inexperienced officers and few or no intelligence networks, Gudkov said.

""After the professionals quit the system, the people who came to replace them had an intellect and world outlook that did not allow them to perform these duties. These people were coming into the service with one idea -- that they could be making money [by taking bribes],"" he said. ""Please answer this question: Can a system like this effectively counter terrorism, when a terrorist can travel quite freely on Russian roads simply by bribing a traffic policeman?""

A senior Interior Ministry officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the terrorist attacks have left the upper ranks of Russian law enforcement ""literally paralyzed and in panic.""

Backing Gudkov's assertions, the officer said his agency was left with no network of informants or on-the-ground intelligence assets when experienced officers left during the 1990s, and the shortfall still has not been resolved, leaving the police now ""in an information vacuum.""

""There is no intelligence information at all, and even if there was, the people at the service would not know how to go about analyzing it,"" he said. ""So what you can expect from the 'stepped-up security' promised by Putin will be essentially more mopping-up raids at markets, dormitories and the places where we always check.... And all these security measures will not have any real effect.""

Putin himself has managed over the years to avoid blame for even the government's most unpopular policies -- but that may not be the case for much longer. A poll by the Public Opinion Foundation in August found that the president's support for the first time slipped below the 50% mark, and that he would attract only 49% of the vote if new elections were held now.

Chess champion Garry Kasparov, now heading Committee 2008, told Echo of Moscow radio that the public has become disillusioned with the idea that a strong state can cure all the nation's ills. ""It's power that has dragged us into this horror, and power that dragged us into this war, and all along this power had nothing but promises, preening with its own force....

""But this power is bankrupted now. And it's not just bankruptcy -- we can say that this power has become a threat to everyone in this country.... And in order to move forward, we must at least begin to diagnose our own illness."""
108,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"The Cold War may be over, but U.S. and Russian soldiers are expanding outposts in this mountainous former Soviet republic about 3,200 miles east of NATO headquarters in Brussels and nearly 2,000 miles from Moscow.

The U.S. opened its base three years ago as a launching pad for troops and cargo heading into Afghanistan. Two years later, with the Americans showing no signs of leaving, Russia opened its own base. Now, Moscow is quadrupling the number of its troops, while the American garrison is crawling with bulldozers and trucks, as Washington spends $10 million replacing tents with sturdier quarters.

Officially, Russia has welcomed the U.S. presence as a reflection of a new partnership against a common enemy: Islamic extremists. Washington, in turn, has praised Moscow for enhancing cooperative security efforts in this volatile corner of Central Asia.

But the cooperation is limited largely to words. The current U.S. base commander has never met his Russian counterpart, troops are mostly forbidden to venture outside their respective gateposts, and military flights are scrupulously segregated.

The bases here are symbols of a new rivalry between East and West for influence over the lands of Russia's old empire. More than a decade after it ended, the global Cold War standoff has been supplanted by competition for political and economic hegemony along Russia's vast frontier stretching from the Baltic Sea to China.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a weakened Russia initially turned inward and the West moved rapidly into the faded superpower's sphere of influence. But now, armed with $50-a-barrel oil and a determination to protect its interests, a newly confident Kremlin is reasserting centuries-old claims.

The competition extends far beyond Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. also has military bases in neighboring Uzbekistan and has sent military trainers to Georgia, where Russia has two bases. Moscow's Baltic Sea fleet sails from a sliver of Russian territory between two new North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, Poland and Lithuania; NATO planes now patrol the skies over former Soviet republics to Russia's west.

The Caspian Sea basin, with its more than 200 billion barrels of oil, is seen by both Russia and the U.S. as a zone of strategic interest. Russia is using its energy reserves to maintain influence in the small, newly independent countries of the Baltic and Caucasus regions.

And now, the struggle between pro-Moscow and pro-Western forces is playing out in the disputed presidential election in Ukraine, a territory that for centuries has been central to Russia's sense of itself as a great power.

""As a military man, I see that Russia is surrounded. And I can imagine the reaction of the U.S. if our country were all of a sudden to declare the Gulf of Mexico the zone of our vital interests. We're gritting our teeth,"" said Russian parliament deputy Viktor Alksnis, a former air force colonel.

""On the other hand, they are mistaken if they think Russia collapsed along with the Soviet Union in the 1990s,"" he said. ""For all the 1,000 years of history of our state, Russia has been like a human heart. It squeezes and unsqueezes. And what we have seen recently is that people who should have looked to Russia as a partner in tackling global problems have instead seen a need to drive the Russian bear back into its den.""

* * *

In 2000, Boris N. Yeltsin handed over the Russian presidency to Vladimir V. Putin, a former KGB agent whose youth and aura of strength gave his demoralized and chaotic country a badly needed shot of confidence.

While Putin consolidated his political power, Russia also gained a windfall from rising global oil prices. Now, backed by its energy wealth, $100 billion in gold and foreign currency reserves (growing lately at a rate of $2 billion a week) and an upgraded arsenal of 7,800 nuclear warheads, Putin has broadly reasserted the power of the Russian state.

He has blocked the sale of Russia's biggest oil companies to Western conglomerates, sharply centralized government authority and driven democratic forces to the political margins.

And in the last year or two, it also has become clearer how Putin aims to position Russia in the world at large. Quietly, Russia is regaining a semblance of its historic empire.

By locking in energy contracts, controlling pipelines and buying up regional utilities, the Kremlin now holds a near-monopoly in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. Russian businessmen have bought up factories, steel mills and energy companies. Russian interests that back pro-Moscow candidates now represent a powerful political force in nearly every former Soviet republic.

""Until recently, everyone was concerned that Russia, weakened by its internal crisis, was becoming unpredictable,"" Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov said this year. ""But now a different kind of Russia is feared: a country which has become stronger and more confident after several years of stability and economic growth.""

To some in the West, the scenes now playing out in the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Baltics hark back to the czarist empire's conflicts with other European powers, including Peter the Great's parade through the Baltics; periodic invasions of Poland; and the ""Great Game"" with Britain for control of Central Asia.

""Some people say this is the new Cold War. It is not. It is much closer to 19th century or early 20th century behavior, where you basically had these feverish qualities sweeping Moscow, when they were off to do something thoroughly stupid and dangerous in Europe,"" said Bruce P. Jackson, a former Pentagon official who now heads the Project on Transitional Democracies, which has lobbied for democratic reform in the former Soviet republics.

But Russian officials say they are intent merely on protecting their country.

""Our main task is to ensure national security, first of all. It is the creation of a belt of security around our country, and a gradual expansion of our coordination with other states on key world issues. We have agreed to new forms of cooperation with NATO,"" Igor S. Ivanov, secretary of the National Security Council, said in an interview.

""But all of this does not mean that we have overcome our differences,"" the former foreign minister said. The U.S. and its allies must keep in mind that Russia is strong militarily and economically, that it retains a seat on the United Nations Security Council, and that it has worked for global stability, he said.

Besides investing heavily in upgrading their strategic nuclear arsenal, Russian officials have signaled that they will use it if necessary: a message that Moscow will not be cowed by the threat of NATO airstrikes.

Putin has tried to use the U.S. presence in the region for his own purposes. Recognizing that Islamic militancy on Russia's borders presents a great danger, he joined the Bush administration's war on terrorism. In his most crucial policy move, he used his influence in Central Asia to help the United States set up bases to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Putin saw an opportunity to forge an alliance with President Bush that would enable him to paint Russia's war against Muslim separatists in Chechnya as part of a common fight against terrorism. The strategy appears to have paid off, to a large degree, as Washington has muted its criticism over allegations of torture and civilian slaughter by Russian troops.

Analysts say Russia also has used the U.S. presence in Central Asia to counter an interloper it fears even more: China.

China's 1.3 billion people and rapidly growing economy, sitting next to Russia's depopulated Far East, engender ""vague horror scenarios"" of Chinese expansion, said Dmitry Trenin, deputy director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

Putin has made strides toward cooperation with China, concluding an economic and security pact in 2001 and signing a border agreement in November. Yet Putin also hedged his bets by facilitating a ""temporary"" U.S. presence, analysts say.

""The idea was, if the U.S. comes, it's a strong counterbalance to China. They don't have deep roots in the region, like China does. The U.S. will leave sooner, rather than later,"" said Ivan Safranchuk, director of the Moscow office of the Washington-based Center for Defense Information.

Russia may have miscalculated.

Officials at NATO, created in 1949 as a bulwark against the Soviet threat, say Russia is proving a reliable partner by participating in joint military exercises, helping halt illegal weapons shipments and sharing intelligence on terrorism and drug trafficking.

""There is discussion on all the most fundamental issues: theater missile defense, defense reform. We're discussing issues even where there's political sensitivity. We had an open discussion on Ukraine just a few days ago, and it was a frank discussion, a very frank discussion,"" said James Appathurai, NATO spokesman in Brussels. ""Of course we do have differences of opinion on some issues.""

But many in the West question whether Russia is committed to transparency in government, democratic elections and a free press. ""That is, in a sense, where the true test of the long-term strength of the relationship will be,"" Appathurai said.

In an open letter to the European Union and NATO in September, more than 100 U.S. and European political leaders and academics, including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former U.S. envoy Richard C. Holbrooke and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), warned that Russia was ""breaking away from the core democratic values"" of the U.S. and Europe.

""President Putin's foreign policy is increasingly marked by a threatening attitude towards Russia's neighbors and Europe's energy security, the return of rhetoric of militarism and empire, and by a refusal to comply with Russia's international treaty obligations,"" the letter said.

The main lines of new military, economic and political competition in the former Soviet republics, an area the Kremlin calls its ""near abroad,"" form a tight circle around Russia.

Although Russia has reminded the U.S. of its pledge that bases in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are temporary, the pace of construction belies the idea that the U.S. will be leaving soon.

""It will all depend on what the Kyrgyz government will support,"" said Col. Bradley R. Pray, commander of the U.S. base in Bishkek. ""Basically, we'll have semi-permanent buildings here.""

U.S. officials scoff at the notion that Central Asian bases represent anything more than a steppingstone to Afghanistan. ""In strategic terms, a base in Kyrgyzstan is a dagger in the heart of nowhere,"" said a diplomat in the region. ""What are we going to use it to attack, if not Afghanistan?""

The Kyrgyz government, which faced a significant incursion by Islamic militants from Uzbekistan in 1999, has welcomed both the Russian and U.S. military. American aid to the country has reached $283 million over the last three years.

Kyrgyzstan's deputy defense minister, Col. Zamir Suerkulov, said the Russian base would provide air support to a multinational force to protect against regional Islamic insurgencies.

But some in the country also feel caught between forces beyond their control.

""When the U.S. base came, many people immediately began to accuse Kyrgyzstan of having betrayed Russia and its allies,"" said Orozbek Moldaliev, head of the SEDEP Research Center, a political think tank in Bishkek. ""Then when the Russian base came in as well, some began to fear that a conflict between the Americans and Russians on the territory of Kyrgyzstan was inevitable.""

But, he said, ""In truth, it's not just a small profit, it's a huge benefit for us. Kyrgyzstan is milking not only two cows, it is also deriving a profit from China. So for most of us, the Cold War has gone from being 'either-or,' to 'and-and.' ""

Earlier this year, thousands of miles to the west, NATO expanded into the three former Soviet Baltic republics -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- but said it did not intend to open bases there. Russian hard-liners are skeptical.

""NATO keeps talking about 'no intentions, no plans.' But we frankly view NATO as an aggressive organization, which is constantly building up its military capabilities and expanding its sphere of operation towards Russia,"" said Leonid D. Ivashov, a retired Russian general who formerly oversaw his nation's international military cooperation directorate.

The Caucasus, the Baltics, and Ukraine -- arenas of rivalry between East and West for centuries -- are also regions of economic competition in which Russia is wielding its main weapon: energy.

Governments that don't toe the Kremlin line risk steep price increases or having the tap turned off entirely -- as happened to Belarus this year after a tiff with Russia.

Supplies were abruptly halted to much of Azerbaijan and Lithuania as well. Moscow reportedly was concerned over Azerbaijan's increased military cooperation with the U.S.

Russia's state-owned gas company, Gazprom, has bought into several Lithuanian gas companies. In 2003, the state-controlled electricity monopoly, Unified Energy Systems, bought a controlling stake in the utility in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi. The firm already has expanded its stakes in half of Ukraine's local electricity providers and has its eye on the market throughout Eastern Europe.

UES chief Anatoly B. Chubais has said he dreams of a ""liberal Russian empire"" stretching across the territory of the former Soviet Union.

Russia canceled much of Armenia's $90-million-plus debt last year in exchange for the transfer of assets in several key factories, scientific research institutes and power facilities that produce the majority of the former Soviet republic's electricity.

The Russian steel giant, Severstal, has bought a controlling stake in Estonia's major oil terminal. And in Latvia, Russia abruptly cut off oil shipments to the port of Ventspils last year in what some Latvian officials complained was an attempt to starve the Baltic nation into selling the facility at a bargain-basement price.

Putin made it clear how important the energy lever was to Russia when he announced last year that it regarded the Soviet-era pipelines that carry its petroleum products to market to be its responsibility -- ""even those parts of the system that are beyond Russia's borders.""

""This is a huge claim, and frankly a colonial claim -- 'Even though the assets are on your soil, they belong to us,' "" said Jackson, the former Pentagon official.

The political turmoil in Ukraine is the latest and largest example of the competition for political influence in the former Soviet republics.

In Georgia, the U.S. is supporting President Mikheil Saakashvili's attempts to regain control over the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- territories that Russia has used to maintain a foothold in the southern Caucasus and destabilize a key new transit route for Caspian Sea oil to the West. Russia has gone so far as to offer citizenship to residents of the two regions.

Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas was removed from office in April, in large part because of his connections to a Russian businessman who contributed $400,000 to his campaign in 2003.

In Ukraine, the Kremlin poured more than $200 million into this fall's presidential election, in part to protect economic ties worth up to $10 billion a year. Putin made two trips to Ukraine before the election to boost the candidacy of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, and huge billboards around Moscow urged Ukrainian expatriates to support Putin's choice. His opponent, Viktor Yushchenko, is a strong advocate of Ukrainian membership in NATO and the European Union.

The reason for the interest is simple. As Vladimir I. Lenin once said, ""If we lose Ukraine, we lose our head.""

Ukraine, with a population of 48 million, is the second-largest country in Europe and transports 90% of Russian gas to Europe. Many of the decisive battles of European history have been fought on its fields, and a westward-tilting Ukraine could sever Russia's access to its Black Sea Fleet, which is currently under a lease agreement with Kiev.

Moreover, Ukraine is the key to Russia's hope of establishing an economic coalition of former Soviet nations as a front against Europe. Belarus and Kazakhstan are also part of a pact initialed this year.

For both East and West, Ukraine always has been a ""pivotal state"" in what former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski describes as the ""Grand Chessboard"" of geopolitics. That is especially true for Moscow, he said.

""Its very existence as an independent country helps transform Russia,"" Brzezinski said. ""Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.""

The dispute in Ukraine also could have implications for Putin's grip on power. The techniques that have enabled the Kremlin and its allies to determine election outcomes in Chechnya and Belarus are on the brink of failure in Ukraine. Most analysts say that would inevitably encourage Russia's own democracy advocates and threaten Moscow's elite.

The U.S. and its allies are reluctant to talk about Russia as a military adversary. ""Nothing we know about Russia, nothing we see and feel in the cooperation that's going on, would suggest we should see Russia as anything but a partner of NATO,"" an alliance spokesman said.

But military planners, perhaps on both sides, remain prepared for the possibility that one day, a leader more aggressive than Putin will take the reins of a reinvigorated Russia. This is not unimaginable in a country in which polls show that the 1970s, when Leonid I. Brezhnev led the Soviet Union, are regarded as a golden era.

In an address to the Senate Intelligence Committee in February, former CIA Director George J. Tenet listed Russia, along with North Korea and China, as a ""pivotal state.""

""The Kremlin's increasing assertiveness is partly grounded in a growing confidence in its military capabilities,"" Tenet said, noting that although the Russian military remained at ""a fraction"" of its former strength, training rates and defense spending were increasing.

Russia's updated military doctrine makes it clear that the Kremlin, like Washington, is prepared to use preemptive strikes against other nations to protect itself, and also to resort to nuclear force if gravely threatened.

The installation of NATO military infrastructure in the Baltics would prompt Russia to ""conduct its policy and military planning based on the principles of self-defense,"" Defense Minister Ivanov warned in a visit to Washington in April.

Russia's newly beefed-up nuclear weapons also provide the Kremlin with an important political tool.

""Clearly, nuclear weapons are a shield against potential U.S. sanctions, military or otherwise,"" said Trenin, the Carnegie official who has written a book on the Russian military. ""The U.S. will not attack a nuclear power.""

Both sides have thought through the logistics, if only theoretically.

In a report prepared by the Rand Corp. for the U.S. Army this year, one scenario explored the possibility of a conflict between Russia and NATO in the Baltics. The report referred to ""an assumed decline in Russian-NATO relations in the period after 2007,"" and weighed how hard it would be for NATO to respond if Russian troops speedily overran the Baltics and dug in to wait for negotiations.

The report, analysts say, measures military capabilities; the chance of Russia invading the Baltics, most agree, is nearly zero.

Russia, for its part, conducted a military exercise in 1999 that envisioned ""enemy"" forces taking over Kaliningrad, the wedge of Russian territory between Poland and Lithuania that is the headquarters of the Baltic Fleet, and striking nuclear power plants and other targets inside Russia. As part of the exercise, a pair of Tupolev bombers simulated nuclear cruise missile strikes on the U.S. East Coast and Europe.

Nikolai Sokov, senior research associate at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, wrote in a report this year that Russia appeared to be using the possibility of limited nuclear strikes as a deterrent against political and military pressure.

But Russian officials say it is a mistake to confuse Moscow's assertion of legitimate interests with a return of empire-building.

""It is wrong to interpret any of this as Russia's attempts to impose its influence,"" said Igor S. Ivanov, the National Security Council secretary. ""In these countries, all the generations of people, although they are people of different nationalities, lived in one state. They had common culture, common education, they worked together, they developed their economies together. If you please, common thinking was formed. Naturally, these are not some artificial ties, these are real ties that connect us.""

At the same time, Russia's reemergence as a player is not to be discounted, they warn.

""Whereas American interests extend thousands of miles, and to many continents, let's accept that Russia has natural interests in the former Soviet states. Let's have a dialogue about this,"" former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in an interview.

""I think we have a unique chance to create a new quality of relations with the West. But we don't want to be beggars. We don't want to be treated by the EU or by the United States like we are down; that is something we will not accept,"" he said. ""Russia will not be scared. Russia will not be intimidated."""
109,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"When a collection of well-heeled political and arts celebrities filed into a downtown theater this month for a production of ""The Inspector,"" few expected to be surprised by the 19th century tale.

But they were. Because this time, Nikolai Gogol's classic story of a lowly civil servant from St. Petersburg who is mistaken for a high-ranking government inspector -- and quickly transforms himself into a pompous and predatory caricature of a bureaucrat -- seemed strangely familiar.

The short stature and balding pate. The colorless eyes. The well-turned German phrase sprinkled into the Russian. When the house lights went up, the crowd erupted into a 10-minute standing ovation.

""There's no doubt about it. It is not about 19th century Russia,"" Sergei Ivanenko, a leader of the opposition Yabloko party, said during intermission. ""It's about our Russia. It is about Putin. We are going back to the times when we need to go to a theater to hear the truth in biting satire -- like in the '70s or '80s, back in the Soviet days.""

Today, President Vladimir V. Putin -- the once unassuming deputy mayor of St. Petersburg whose meteoric rise to the presidency ushered in a new era of assertive state power -- is almost certain to be reelected to a second four-year term. The day will mark an important turning point for Russia and for much of the world, whose security rests, in part, on decisions made by the world's second major nuclear power.

In just four years, the enigmatic former KGB spy has quietly established himself as arguably the most powerful Russian leader since Josef Stalin. He has struck forcefully at the wealthy oligarchs who helped put him in power, eviscerated the once-critical broadcast media, gained a majority in parliament and aggressively reasserted Russia's claim to geopolitical dominance up to the steel toes of NATO's boots.

What happens in Putin's second term may be decisive for this nation of 145 million people still grappling with poverty; a heating and water infrastructure on the verge of collapse; deep public health problems with AIDS, tuberculosis and alcoholism; and an economy perilously dependent on oil.

Putin appears determined to pull Russia away from the brink by opening up to the global economy, developing high technology and attacking the bureaucratic corruption that has smothered small business.

But many observers have grave doubts that Putin can achieve these goals, and his administration's secretiveness leaves wide uncertainty about the president's real intentions.

Almost equally plausible is a scenario in which Putin reasserts broad state control over the economy, pays only lip service to attacking corruption and presides over an increasingly belligerent foreign policy.

Putin's unexpectedly forceful leadership has been greeted enthusiastically by much of the public, which credits him with rescuing the country from the ruins of Boris N. Yeltsin's presidency and reasserting Russia's status as a power to be reckoned with.

Putin, 51, assumed power in Russia a little more than a year after a 1998 economic collapse had bankrupted the banks and wiped out many Russians' savings. When it was all over, a third of the country was in poverty.

A handful of oligarchs had seized control of Russia's huge state-owned oil, nickel and aluminum companies and used their money to establish a circle of power around Yeltsin. They proceeded to dispatch most of the $250 billion that the government estimates was funneled out of the country.

Since Putin's election in 2000, the gross domestic product has grown a healthy 29.9%, according to the government and international financial institutions. Last year it grew 7.3%, mostly thanks to high oil prices. Wages and pensions have risen and are paid on time. The minimum wage has quadrupled in three years, and unemployment is down by a third.

Putin didn't achieve these gains by giving Russia's brazen new capitalists free rein, as Yeltsin and his advisors clearly expected he would.

Instead, Putin moved to neutralize the most politically ambitious of the oligarchs and aggressively imposed the power of the state -- bringing Russia's powerful regional governors to heel, threatening the natural resources industry with a $3-billion tax increase, pouring new money into the faltering army.

The central question for Putin's second term is whether he will be willing to let go of the vast store of personal power he has accumulated in the name of guaranteeing the country's stability.

Now that federal prosecutors have arrested Russia's richest man, former Yukos Oil Chief Executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky -- who used some of his $15-billion fortune to finance the Kremlin's political challengers -- will Putin be willing to bring Khodorkovsky to trial and let him go if a jury acquits him?

Will Russia's last remaining pro-democracy opposition parties, wiped out of parliament in a tightly controlled December campaign, be allowed to reestablish themselves?

Will television news be permitted to carry anything meatier than the nightly diet of Putin dedicating a new highway, Putin surveying military exercises, Putin giving away his dog's new puppies to grateful children?

Across Russia, no one has a sure answer to these questions, least of all Putin, who talks of freedom and force with equal frequency and passion.

""As a citizen ... I at least allow him the possibility of being a transformer,"" said Lilia Shevtsova, who has written a political biography of the Russian president. ""But as a coldblooded analyst, I'd have to say, no way. He believes that the only way to modernize Russia is to keep all power in one fist.""

But Sergei Markov, a political operative with close ties to the Kremlin, said Putin's critics forget that he and even the secretive ex-KGB men who are his closest advisors grew up feeling a kinship with the West.

""All of these people are my generation, and I know them quite well,"" Markov said. ""In high school, they listened not to revolutionary songs, not to folk songs, but the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd."" When Paul McCartney performed in Red Square last year, he said, it was the fulfillment of one of Putin's dreams.

Putin was a career KGB officer who was posted in East Germany for five years before joining the office of reformist Mayor Anatoly Sobchak of St. Petersburg in 1990. When Sobchak failed to win reelection six years later, Putin went to work for Yeltsin's administration in Moscow.

From there, his rise was swift. He was appointed to head the FSB, the domestic successor agency to the KGB, in 1998. In August 1999 he was appointed prime minister, and on New Year's Eve of that year, Yeltsin resigned and appointed Putin to replace him. He won election to his first full term the following March.

Putin has a reputation for pushing himself mercilessly. He is a master at judo. When he took up alpine skiing, said his instructor, Leonid Tyagachyov, Putin wasn't content with whizzing down the regular slopes. In 2002, he insisted on taking a helicopter to a remote peak in the Caucasus and skied 2 1/2 miles down the side of a steep mountain.

""It was an extreme situation, even for myself. It takes a huge amount of struggle to learn new techniques as you go,"" said Tyagachyov, head of Russia's Olympic ski team, who was terrified that the president would be injured on his watch.

""He fell, and he got up, and he fell again, and when the difficult part was over, I said, 'Is that enough?' And he said: 'No. Let's go again.' ""

Although he is said to have a brilliant mind for remembering figures and details, Putin has forced himself to grow intellectually into the job, Kremlin observers say.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a member of the select group of Kremlin journalists who often speak with the president, said Putin embarked on a reading program after he became president to expand his knowledge of history. ""In the past, if you asked him who among the historic figures of Russia appeals to him the most, he would always say Peter the Great,"" he said. ""Today, he can talk for hours on the subject.

""He feels that he is already a historic figure. To him, the great figures of history are now like colleagues, rather than characters from the past.""

When President Bush met Putin in 2001, he said he looked into the Russian leader's eyes and got ""a sense of his soul."" But the kinship has eroded since then amid increasingly pointed U.S. criticism of Russia's handling of Yukos, its brutal campaign in separatist Chechnya and its treatment of the broadcast media.

Nor has Washington been comfortable with Putin's increasingly sharp-edged foreign policy. Over the last year, the Kremlin has confronted the U.S. on its invasion of Iraq, refused to speed up the withdrawal of Russia's provocative troop deployments in Georgia and Moldova and announced the development of a new generation of strategic nuclear missiles -- a stern warning to NATO nations that might be interested in challenging Moscow's hegemony in the former Soviet republics.

""I was surprised to learn what a majority of Russians [said] when asked, 'What do you expect from your government?' I thought they would say, 'First of all, we need an improvement of our life. More security, more jobs, better payment, better social services,' "" said Yevgeny Kiselev, a former television broadcaster who is editor of the weekly Moskovskiye Novosti. ""No. They want Great Mother Russia. They want the government to turn Russia back into a great power.""

Some current polls show Putin's popularity as high as 80%.

""Now, the people at least have felt stability in their own purses. We're at least crawling somewhere. That's a big improvement,"" said Alexander Shaposhnikov, a biology professor in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. Shaposhnikov earns only $200 a month, but at least now, he said, he can depend on his small salary being paid on time.

""What is democracy, really?"" he asked. ""I think in this country, democracy has been successfully superseded by the fear of a notion called anarchy. You have to remember, freedom is worth something only if you've got something. If your only thought is how to support yourself and feed your kids, why do I need freedom like that?""

Valentin Danilov lost his job as head of the Thermo-Physics Center at Krasnoyarsk State Technical University in May 2000, when he was arrested outside his apartment by FSB agents.

""Putin became president in March 2000. They initiated criminal charges against me in May. So I've been fighting for survival during the entire term of his presidency,"" Danilov said one recent morning.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Danilov had been unable to get ""a single penny"" of government funding for his research in the physics of space plasma. So in 2000, he began a joint venture with a Chinese company to research weather in space. The project called for equipping satellites with primitive measurement devices, using a simple technology that had been widely published.

When the FSB accused him of selling secrets to the Chinese, Danilov became one of half a dozen Russian scientists imprisoned for espionage since Putin became president. Most of the charges against the group were regarded as dubious by human rights organizations.

He spent a year and a half in prison awaiting trial, during which he lived almost exclusively on the porridge his wife brought him, he said. He lost 33 pounds. When his case finally came to trial, Danilov was acquitted by a jury. But his job is gone.

""What's wrong in this country? I can tell you that right now: 40 million pensioners live below the poverty line in this nation. They are basically on the edge of starvation,"" he said. ""When the older generation is allowed to die like this, I can tell you, it will backfire with their grandchildren.""

On Oct. 13, 1999, NTV television broadcast a program that may have been the beginning of the end for the independent media under Putin. The program centered on the bombing of four apartment buildings a month earlier. More than 300 people died in the attacks, which authorities blamed on terrorists from Chechnya.

Putin's response to the bombings was swift and severe. On Sept. 30, he launched Russia's second war in Chechnya, alleging that the republic had become a hotbed of international Islamic terrorism. Putin's popularity rating surged from 2% to 70% in less than six months.

From the beginning, there were troubling questions about what some observers thought was the possible role of the security services in the bombings. For one thing, FSB agents had been caught six days after the last bombing planting what appeared to be explosives in the basement of another apartment building. The FSB director said it was only an exercise.

But the fact that some Russians were prepared to believe that elements of the government could have been involved opened a Pandora's box, especially when the issue was aired on national television.

In December, the FSB seized 4,400 copies of a book documenting circumstantial evidence against the agency in the bombing case, titled ""The FSB Blows Up Russia."" Lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin, a former FSB agent who had looked into the bombings, was arrested Oct. 22 -- a week before he was scheduled to present his findings to a Moscow court -- and accused of working with the British secret services.

From the beginning, Putin had made it clear that a free press was not an institution that held great appeal for him.

A year after he became president, Putin called in all of Moscow's senior editors and tried to enlist their support, said Alexei Venediktov, editor in chief of the upstart Echo of Moscow radio station, probably the last bastion of free broadcast journalism in Russia.

""He said, 'We are in a difficult situation, both economically and politically. I ask you editors to help me restore Russia. We are all patriots. We all love our country, and this is why I beg you to help me.'

""The way I see it, he thinks the media is an instrument, but not an institution. He thinks it is a tool in the hands of the owner. If the owner is the state, the mass media should act in the interests of the authorities. If the owner is a private person, the media can be expected to act in [his] interests.""

Certainly, that is what was happening in the 1990s, when media oligarchs Vladimir A. Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky -- now living in exile -- used their broadcast outlets to savage political opponents and promote politicians, including Yeltsin, who helped protect their substantial fortunes.

Yet Gusinsky's NTV station evolved into a lively and respected news and entertainment outlet that provided some of the first objective coverage of the war in Chechnya and ridiculed Putin and other officials in a weekly satire program.

In a meeting with the NTV journalists, recalled Kiselev, who headed the network, Putin at first was friendly, saying he understood that the station's owner, Gusinsky, was at fault, not his employees.

""It looked like he was expecting us to say, 'Oh, Vladimir Vladimirovich, thank you so much, excuse us for worrying.' But it didn't happen. We started to say, 'Look, you are wrong. You have to understand, we are not just employed by Mr. Gusinsky.... He gave us the money, and we created the best private television network in the country.'

""The moment he saw we were arguing with him, he immediately became very hostile. You just felt it. He dropped the mask, no smile on his face, and he started to say very tough things. 'I know all about your high salaries, I know all about your tax evasion.... I know all about your hourlong conversations with Gusinsky.' I said, Vladimir Vladimirovich, are you tapping my phone?' He just looked at me in a very angry way and said, 'Next question.' ""

The state-owned gas company, Gazprom, which had obtained 46% of NTV's shares, took control of the station on April 3, 2001. The next two stations Kiselev worked at suffered similar fates, with the last one, TVS, closing down last June. ""It happened in mid-program,"" he said. ""The signal just disappeared.""

So how far, exactly, up to the edge of fear -- to the nation's totalitarian past -- will Putin take Russia? Many Russians wish the answer did not depend so heavily on one man's inclinations.

""I'm trying to show the people that Vladimir Putin is not a god, he's not a czar. He's an ordinary human being,"" said Irina Khakamada, a member of the Union of Right Forces party who is challenging the president in today's election.

Putin's strength, Khakamada said, is his ability to make various sectors of the population believe he is working to their benefit. ""Putin has got the amazing quality of being able to tell people exactly what they want to hear,"" she said. ""But he's got no political course. No one has a clue about exactly what Putin aspires to build.

""The elites don't like this, but the people do. Because they all believe it is something they invented themselves."""
110,LAT,Kim Murphy,2005,Russia Terrorism,"A few years ago, this spindly island that Russia wears like a holstered gun on its eastern hip was as close to nowhere as anyone could imagine.

Eight time zones from Moscow, Sakhalin Island was best known for the day in 1983 when a South Korean airliner strayed too close to a top-secret Soviet military installation and got shot out of the sky. Playwright Anton Chekhov had a one-word description when he visited in 1890: ""Hell.""

That was before capitalism hit Russia, and before oil hit $40 a barrel.

These days, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is a boomtown that makes Deadhorse, Alaska, look like yesterday's news. The southern bit of the island is awash in gravel trucks, roughnecks and more cash than anybody has seen for a long time. The hotel near a liquefied natural gas plant site is booked up for the next three years. Next door to Royal Dutch/Shell Group's headquarters downtown, the Kona Bar is full of North Sea brogues and Texas drawls at happy hour, which starts at 5 and ends when there's somewhere else to go in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, which is never.

""We are spending money this year at the rate of $100 a second,"" said David J. Greer, project director for Royal Dutch/Shell's Sakhalin Energy Investment Co., which is building the world's largest liquefied natural gas plant on the island and two oil platforms offshore. ""This year alone, we will spend $3 billion. Everything about this thing has got lots of zeroes on the end of it. It's just huge.""

This is what happens when a country as big as Russia decides to go global in the oil and gas business. Although the former Soviet Union has pumped crude for years, only recently has Russia emerged as the world's second-biggest oil exporter and -- if the Bush administration has its way -- a potentially important new supplier of both oil and gas to the United States.

Russia's crude oil production rivals that of Saudi Arabia, and analysts say its reserves could provide the output answer for the United States, China, South Korea and Japan, which have grown increasingly wary of their dependence on producers in the Middle East.

""Our goal is to diversify our access to energy exports from around the world, and we would very much like to see the opportunity for the U.S. to have access to larger amounts of Russian exports,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said in a visit to Moscow last month.

Formidable obstacles stand in the way of Russia's becoming a big new supplier to the U.S. anytime soon. Among them is Russia's inability to export more oil until it builds new pipelines, and Moscow's ambivalence about the U.S. market when customers in Japan and China are closer, possibly more voracious in the long run and ready to strike better deals.

Capacity Tapped Out

Russian oil production is expected to grow from 8.9 million barrels a day to 10 million by 2010. But the state-owned company that has control of Russia's oil transportation network, Transneft, says it has hit a ceiling with shipments of slightly more than 4 million barrels a day and can't sustain production growth without major new pipeline capacity.

Japan recently stepped forward with major financing guarantees for a $12-billion, 2,500-mile pipeline that would carry Siberian oil to the eastern Russian city of Nakhodka, from where it would be shipped to Japan.

The United States would prefer that a new pipeline run westward to Murmansk at the Barents Sea. Washington has offered to conduct a feasibility study on such a line -- an offer the Russians coolly said was not what they meant when they said they were interested in ""foreign participation.""

Sergei Oganesyan, chief of Russia's Federal Energy Agency, said last month that the U.S.-preferred route was third on the government's list of priorities, behind expansion of the existing oil transit line to the Baltic Sea and the proposed route to Japan and possibly China.

A ray of hope for the United States appeared last week when Transneft President Semyon Vainshtok suggested that a shorter, cheaper Barents Sea pipeline could be built if it terminated at the port of Indiga, instead of Murmansk. The price tag would be about $6 billion, compared with as much as $15 billion for the Murmansk route, he said.

The pipeline issue has been an undercurrent in the U.S.- Russian political dialogue, especially when it comes to the troubles of Russian energy giant Yukos Oil, whose former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is on trial in Moscow on fraud and tax evasion charges.

U.S. officials repeatedly have raised concerns that Khodorkovsky's arrest in October -- and the conceivable bankrupting of Yukos itself with a more than $6-billion tax bill recently affirmed by a Russian court -- could undermine foreign investor confidence and raise questions about the rule of law and security of private investments in Russia.

The geopolitical subtext goes deep. Before his arrest, Khodorkovsky was said to be negotiating the sale of a big stake in Yukos to ChevronTexaco Corp. or Exxon Mobil Corp., which would transfer key decision making for the engine of the Russian economy to a boardroom in California or Texas.

Khodorkovsky also was promoting the idea of a pipeline on the U.S.-preferred route through northern Russia and lobbying for private construction and ownership of new pipelines -- a plan that would eliminate the government's most important lever of control over a resource that is, thanks to the market reforms of the 1990s, mostly in corporate hands.

""Pipeline ownership is the single most efficient and the cheapest way of controlling the entire Russian oil sector,"" said Steven Dashevsky, senior oil and gas analyst with Aton Capital Group. ""While it probably has not single-handedly determined the whole Yukos affair, it clearly had a very, very significant impact. Khodorkovsky ... was trying to run his own energy policy.""

The oil delivery issues became so thorny that American diplomats earlier this year pronounced the U.S.-Russian energy dialogue essentially ""stalled.""

Eyeing Natural Gas

Another hydrocarbon -- natural gas -- has put new life into the exchange, and Russian and U.S. officials are making optimistic predictions that a good part of Russia's estimated 47 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves soon will begin arriving in the form of liquefied natural gas to the United States.

The Russian state-owned oil giant Gazprom is looking at exporting to the United States from Siberia's Yamal Peninsula as well as a $15-billion project to develop offshore gas deposits in the Barents Sea -- an endeavor U.S. officials are seriously discussing financing, through the United States Export-Import Bank. That production could be marketed on the U.S. East Coast.

Not surprisingly, Gazprom is trying for a piece of the action in Sakhalin -- a potential supplier to the U.S. West Coast -- where Royal Dutch/Shell is scheduled to begin the island's first exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, in 2007, with Exxon Mobil not far behind.

Sakhalin producers already have signed contracts for 3.4 million tons a year of LNG deliveries to Japan, about a third of Shell's expected production, but also are conducting negotiations for deliveries to other Asian countries and the U.S. West Coast, only 11 to 12 days' sail away.

An LNG import terminal proposed for the Baja California coast near Ensenada would receive Sakhalin deliveries; another terminal is under discussion at Long Beach.

""I firmly believe that somewhere between Seattle and San Diego, two to three LNG terminals will be built,"" Andy Calitz, Sakhalin Energy's commercial director, said in a recent interview.

LNG technology has transformed the delivery of natural gas around the world; supercooling allows it to be compressed and transported in tankers like oil, creating an international gas market that never existed before. Sakhalin Energy's sprawling plant on the coast of Aniva Bay will be the largest of its kind, producing 9.6 million tons a year.

Sakhalin's development is massive in almost every other way. Enormous new offshore oil platforms are being built in the Sea of Okhotsk, so big they can withstand the heavy load of ice that will encase them half the year.

Undersea pipelines will be built to carry oil and gas to shore, where it will be funneled into 500-mile pipelines, now under construction, and transported from the north end of Sakhalin to the south end, to Shell's planned new oil and gas export terminal.

Shell has committed $300 million to local infrastructure improvements, but it is not universally viewed as a good cor- porate citizen. Trucks hauling fill material to the LNG plant site chewed up the roads so badly this spring they had to be closed in some places. Aniva Bay, one of the most productive fishing zones in the Russian Far East, has been loaded with silt since Shell began drilling 1.5 million tons of gravel from the seafloor near the LNG plant and dumping it in the middle of the bay.

On the island, housing prices have shot skyward, but most Sakhalin residents have seen little so far from the bonanza. Although unemployment is at 2% now, most high-paying jobs have gone to foreigners. In fact, under new tax legislation, the local region will realize only about 1/12 of the royalties it had once hoped to earn from oil and gas development, with most of the bounty going to Moscow.

For all that, Sakhalin officials say the future looks bright: The island is getting important new infrastructure improvements and high-tech training that will provide residents with prospects more diverse than fishing and a horizon more distant than the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk.

""Two to three years ago, no one had any faith in the Sakhalin projects.... No one thought the implementation of such large-scale, hugely expensive and grandiose projects such as these could ever be possible in such an unpredictable country as Russia,"" said Galina Pavlova, director of the Sakhalin region's Department of Oil and Gas.

""But my department has been working with what I tenderly call the sharks of imperialism for 10 years now,"" she said. ""A tremendous energy infrastructure is being built which will stretch from the south end to the north end of Sakhalin. And our kids have started to have a future."""
111,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"Over a 100-day period in 1994, Rwanda's campaign of ethnic cleansing turned the country into one vast execution ground. For scale and speed, the genocide was the most efficient in recorded history, carried out mostly with machetes.

In April 1994, after the the plane carrying Rwanda's president was shot down, the government mobilized Rwanda's Hutu majority to physically eradicate the minority Tutsi, saying the Hutu faced the prospect of subjugation again if the descendants of their former Tutsi feudal lords were allowed to win a civil war.

When the killers flagged, government-controlled radio exhorted them to ever-more effort. ""The graves are only half-full,"" one announcer proclaimed at the start of the massacres. ""Who will help fill them?"" When the genocide finally was halted with the defeat of the regime by mainly Tutsi rebel forces, about 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu had been murdered.

Ten years later, encouraged by the government and often with the help of local churches, survivors and killers alike are trying to come to grips with living together in the same villages and towns, however awkwardly. In the long shadow of one of the century's great crimes, many seek to rebuild the broken bonds that once held communities together, to explore the possibility of restoring simple trust between neighbors and within families, so that the country can in time recover."
112,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"Gervais Tuyishime walks in from school. The 9-year-old boy drops his bag and shakes hands stiffly with his mother. Then he sits quietly on a wooden stool. No words are exchanged.

Most days are like that, says the mother, Alphoncina Mutuze. Her relationship with her son is an awkward one, characterized by bouts of anger out of proportion to the boy's perceived infractions, and frequently resulting in hard slaps to his face. On occasion, mother and child unexpectedly allow a hint of affection, and Mutuze embraces her only son, then quickly lets go, as if terrified of crossing a line she has willed herself to faithfully observe.

Gervais is the product of the gang rapes and sexual slavery his mother was subjected to 10 years ago during the Rwandan genocide, when the Hutu majority slaughtered about 800,000 of the minority Tutsi and their Hutu sympathizers. The dead included every member of Mutuze's family -- her parents as well as all eight siblings.

As a result, Gervais represents two irreconcilable symbols for his mother. He serves as a reminder of the terrible violation that drove her to attempt suicide by drowning. At the same time, the boy is the only known relative she has left.

""I really don't hate him but I feel this child is not mine,"" Mutuze says quietly, a constant refrain over several days of interviews in her one-room hilltop home in an empty-pockets neighborhood of this capital. ""This child is not mine. I could not imagine how I would nurse this child. I wanted to kill this child. I looked at him and I wanted to kill him. I beat him even when I was still nursing him. I beat him even now.

""At times I try to will myself not to beat him up anymore, and I tell myself he is the only relative in the world I have. So yes, sometimes I feel that I am his mother.""

Mutuze's fitful attempts to reconcile herself with her unwanted son offer a ground-level view of a larger struggle in Rwandan society, among individuals and between communities, to fashion a workable coexistence in a post-genocide society. Compelled to live together under conditions of grinding poverty, emotional turmoil and daily desperation, killers and survivors alike are feeling their way around the possibility that they could rebuild the everyday trust necessary for the normal functioning of a community shattered by genocide.

At its most fundamental, the genocide was an act of monumental betrayal, organized by the government in the service of the ideology of Hutu Power, which insisted there wasn't enough room in this small central African country for the Tutsi. The majority of the population proved to be willing executioners, and priest turned against parishioner, teacher against pupil, doctor against patient and, often, husband against wife.

""The challenge of the genocide is not simply the killing, but that husband killed wife and father killed son, and the whole moral foundation of the country was destroyed,"" says Domitira Mukantaganda, vice president of Rwanda's supreme court, who also oversees a grassroots quasi-judicial process designed to promote reconciliation more than the mere imposition of justice.

In this traumatized country, few groups are grappling with the legacy of the genocide with more difficulty than the thousands of women raped by the militia that spearheaded the mass killings of 10 years ago. While precise statistics are unavailable, largely because a public discussion of rape remains taboo and victims are loath to come forward, officials say about 250,000 Tutsi women were victimized.

Children born of such rapes are estimated at between 10,000 and 25,000.

Rape victims share in common with other genocide survivors the loss of family members and large-scale dispossession. But a majority of them also have to contend with HIV and the ravages of AIDS.

And many, like Mutuze, are struggling to accept the children from these unwanted encounters, and to answer uncomfortable questions from restless 9-year-olds dealing with neighborhood taunts regarding the peculiar details of their births.

The House on the Hill
Mother and son share a simple one-room house, a brick and mortar structure built four years ago with the help of a survivors' group. The main section holds simple furnishings -- two plastic chairs, a wooden table and bench. Pictures of Christ and a few choice quotes from the Book of Psalms, a staple of any Rwandan household, adorn the walls. Mother and son sleep in an alcove to the side. Corrugated iron sheets overhead provide some defense against the elements. Sunlight streams through a couple of perforations in the roof.

This was a step up from their temporary accommodations amid disdainful neighbors, an existence made worse by the arms-length treatment from old friends ashamed of the unspeakable circumstances of Mutuze's motherhood. The two had moved from dwelling to dwelling, occasionally even sleeping out in the open.

""Some of the people, they couldn't bear to look at the child because of who he was,"" Mutuze says. Neighborhood kids called him names. A favorite was ""Little Interahamwe,"" after the feared militia of machete-wielding killers who hacked hundreds of thousands to death during the genocide. Interahamwe means ""those who fight together"" in the Kinyarwanda language.

""This boy leads a very difficult life,"" she says, her granite face softening briefly as she considers her son sitting on a low stool, impassive. ""He's cheerful enough but everyone knows the circumstances of his birth. So other children call him Little Interahamwe. They call him this so constantly that he came to ask me what interahamwe means. I told him that these were people who killed a lot of people and were mass murderers.""

Gervais just sits, quiet, speaking only when spoken to, and then only monosyllabically. A slight boy with a happy face, he exists in the straitened conditions of a child whose mother at once embraces and rejects him, and whose father is a rapist with an identity impossible to establish. With his mother's entire family murdered, the boy is even denied the protective embrace of the typical African extended family, which could have helped absorb the shocks of his young life.

In anger and perhaps in frustration, Mutuze at times similarly disparages her son, calling him Little Killer, ""when I couldn't bear the sight of him."" When he was 6, she wouldn't let him out to play for an entire year, even when she was out working and he was alone, because she was tired of the whispering and name-calling that his sight provoked in the neighbors.

""I was so ashamed of him,"" she says.

Her emotions boil over and she sobs, startling herself. ""Sometimes I just cry unexpectedly,"" she says, ""without knowing what has caused it.""

One Day in April
On the afternoon of April 18, 1994, Mutuze ventured out of the Kigali confectionery factory where she had taken refuge for more than a week as a convulsion of killing seized hold of the city. She was desperate for food.

But this was a terrible time to walk around any neighborhood in Kigali. Since the genocide began April 7, following the killing in a plane crash of President Juvenal Habyarimana, the city had been completely overrun by the interahamwe, backed by government soldiers, who set up roadblocks everywhere and murdered and pillaged at will.

Mutuze came to a roadblock nearby, in the Kicukiro neighborhood.

""That was when I saw those people.""

The roadblock was manned, she says, by five thugs, all of whom she knew peripherally at the factory where she worked packing cookies, candies and cooking oil. They were casual laborers there in more normal times, and went by nicknames such as Head Coach.

But now they were drunk on banana beer and the genocide had made them powerful, and they wanted her, at 20 a pretty, smooth-skinned woman, tall and slender. And alone.

""They all had machetes, and they raped me right there in the open,"" Mutuze says softly, her face hardening and her body rigid. She pressed her fingers and thumbs to her temple and squeezed. ""It was broad daylight. As soon as the two of them were done with me, a car arrived and they told me to get up, and I ran off.

""It was the most horrific thing. They were taunting me. I was crying. I was sobbing, and thinking I was dead. I don't know how I found my way back to the factory.""

Hearing the Story
As his mother describes the first of numerous times she was raped by the interahamwe, Gervais sits quietly on his stool, face in his arms, looking up to his mother without any particular expression and without a word. It is the first time, Mutuze says, that she'd told the story in his presence.

It is not a story she freely tells at any length, even at a support group she attends with other victims. In fact, when she first broached the scene at the roadblock, and was asked how many men were involved in the assault, Mutuze hit a wall. Physically and emotionally shaken, she fell into a dreadful silence, and the conversation was abandoned until the following day.

""It is taboo for women to even admit they had been gang-raped,"" says Mary Balikungera, executive director of Rwandan Women's Network, which tries to encourage rape victims to come forward to receive counseling and support. ""The mothers don't want to be visible, and some have had their children absorbed in their wider families, so the children know they are members of a family but without knowing exactly who their parents are. Now the mothers are worried about whether to tell the children the truth.""

Escape from Kigali
Not long after Mutuze's ordeal, her factory manager, an expatriate from the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles who was arranging to flee the carnage with his family, offered to take her, too. He got the governor of Kigali, Tharcisse Renzaho, an acquaintance, to write them a letter granting safe passage. Mutuze would pose as his daughter. They fled overland to Goma, in neighboring Congo (then called Zaire), running a gauntlet of roadblocks and easing their way with well-timed bribes.

But such was Mutuze's luck that Goma, which sits across the border on Lake Kivu, also was the destination weeks later for more than 2 million Hutu refugees and the defeated army and militias of Hutu Power. They had fled westward in July 1994, ahead of the rapid advance of the mainly Tutsi rebel forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which had finally put a stop to the genocide.

For Mutuze, a young Tutsi woman in a sea of Hutu refugees herded into vast camps in the shadow of the Nyiragongo mountains, her nightmares had only just begun.

The refugee camps hastily erected in Goma spread out over an unyielding lunar landscape of volcanic rock. In the first few days the miserable multitudes, in shock at their sudden dislocation, milled about as if in a trance, hungry and exhausted. In their vulnerable condition, a cholera epidemic struck, killing as many as 7,000 every day for two hellish weeks. At dawn each day thousands of bodies wrapped in straw littered the camps or were stacked by roadsides. At dusk, smoke from tens of thousands of cooking fires rose in the fading light and the volcanoes bubbled menacingly in the distance, creating a surreal backdrop for the unfolding calamity.

'Lied to Save Myself'
In a section of Mugunga, the largest of he camps, Mutuze found herself in the company of 25 others, a lone Tutsi trying desperately to conceal her identity where exposure guaranteed death. Only she and six others in her corner of the camp survived the cholera outbreak. The question was whether she could survive the interahamwe and soldiers of the defeated Rwandan Armed Forces, who controlled the camp as they'd controlled the country they'd just abandoned.

""Most of the time I lied to save myself, telling the others I am Hutu,"" she says. ""But some people would look at me and say, 'You're Tutsi.' Men took advantage of this and took me to their tents and protected me that way.

""Some men were claiming me. Because I was young some men were fighting over me. One soldier took me with him, and he always had to fight off the others who were trying to lay claim to me. That man was able to keep me for some time. I considered this lucky, because there was another Tutsi girl who was gang-raped and she died. Yes, she did die. My life was like that.""

But inevitably the pressure built on the soldier to get rid of the Tutsi ""snake,"" and that he should finish the ""work"" they had started and very nearly completed inside Rwanda by killing Mutuze.

""The man succumbed after some time and sent me away,"" she says. ""He wanted to kill me at first, but then looked at me and said, 'Someone else can kill you.' Another man claimed me shortly afterwards."" Thus was the young woman passed from hand to hand, essentially serving as a sex slave in exchange for permission to stay alive. Then, a few months later, came the telltale signs of pregnancy.

Driven Toward Suicide
""I started feeling sick. I had no desire to eat or do anything at all,"" she says. ""When I realized I was pregnant, I first thought of suicide, then abortion. I had many bad thoughts on my mind constantly; abortion was the main thought. Unfortunately there was no way I could afford it because it could have been a death sentence if some of those in the camp found out. They would say that is our child; the child is Hutu.""

Mutuze fell into a dark mood, brooding, looking for a way to end it all. Early in 1995, when she was about five months pregnant -- she's lost all precise recollection of time save the day she was first gang-raped -- Mutuze walked into nearby Lake Kivu, attempting to drown herself.

""I felt my youth had gone away and I was useless,"" she says. ""I had no one to talk to. Those were terrible moments that I constantly wished for death. There was no one to confide in, not even God."" Some fishermen nearby spotted Mutuze before she slipped beneath the waves, and thwarted her. With the cluster of refugees around her by then extra-vigilant, she carried the pregnancy to term and, in June or July of 1995 -- she couldn't tell for certain -- Mutuze gave birth to a son in a makeshift medical tent run by Doctors Without Borders, the relief agency.

What to call such a baby?

Aurea Kayiganwa, advocacy director for Avega, the main Rwandan association for genocide widows, says the anger, despair and shame felt by many a raped survivor can be measured in the names they have given -- or have allowed family members to give -- their children.

""In Rwandan culture, a baby's name must fit the circumstances of its birth,"" says Kayiganwa. This is equally true in almost any African society, where names mark a major event, usually heroic, or are aspirational, a yearning for the good and great things that parents everywhere wish for their children. But among the rape victims of Rwanda's genocide, children's names took on a gnarled and bitter quality. In addition to Little Interahamwe, many children born of rape are called Jiyamubandi (""The Intruder""); Niyigena (""It's God's Plan,"" given a child as if with a sigh of resignation); Mbuzukongira (""I am at a loss,"") or Ntahobitabaye (""It's not only me."")

A 'Thanksgiving'
Such was Mutuze's aversion to her newborn son that she wanted to name him War, or at least Zaire, as a reminder of the nightmarish camp where she became a sex slave. But some of the women in the camp prevailed on her to do otherwise, and she was finally persuaded to accept a name they chose -- Tuyishime, which stands for ""Thanksgiving.""

""I wanted to call him something bad, but these women said that would not be good because it was not his choice to be born,"" she says, casting a sideways glance at the boy, who seems to be following the conversation with rapt attention, all the while without losing the gentle smile that appears to be a permanent feature of his handsome face.

If Gervais feels any emotion other than general happiness, it never is readily apparent. His is not a particularly active face, save for the eyes, which move constantly to take in his surroundings but almost never betray anything beyond blissful contentment.

And so his expression remains constant as his mother says as follows: ""I thought of killing this baby. I did not feel even a single moment of affection for this baby. The thing that prevented me from killing it was that I would be killed myself, and killed badly, by those who claimed it was theirs.

""I would love to give him away to somebody else who can take care of him.""

The instinct for rejection of a child born of rape is very powerful in victims, says Jean Damascene Ndayambaje, an associate professor of experimental psychology at the National University of Rwanda, who has seen many such patients over the past decade. He speaks of a young woman who was so insistent on abortion that she had to be tied down and given a Caesarian.

""She totally rejected the child and the child had to be taken to an orphanage,"" says Ndayambaje, who heads the university's department of mental health, in the southern city of Butare. ""I counseled her for three months. Even the girl's family had to get some counseling so they could allow the woman and child to be reintegrated back into the family.""

Mutuze says she thinks often how much lighter her load would be if any members of her family had survived the Rwandan Holocaust.

Little Girl Spoiled
She was born in 1974 in the village of Musange outside the central town of Gikongoro, the youngest of nine children of a cattle rearer, Petero Gasimba, and his wife, Atanasia Bwumgura, who nursed the young Mutuze until she entered first grade.

Mutuze was particularly close to her oldest brother, Pierre Hakizimana, who doted on his baby sister, fended off neighborhood bullies and bought her sweets. ""He was a trader, and he had the means,"" she says, her voice a bit unsteady at the memory. ""I am heartbroken when I think of him. He loved me so.""

At the suggestion of her sister, Bridgette Mukamusoni, who had married and relocated to Kigali, Mutuze moved to the capital in 1987. She never had more than a sixth-grade education, and it took a while before she found a job at the factory, called Sakirwa, where she packed soap and other products. By this time, around 1991, the political temperature was rising in Kigali and around the country. After more than three decades of persecution, including periodic pogroms that had forced hundreds of thousands of the minority Tutsi into refugee camps in neighboring countries, the children of those refugees had formed a rebel army and invaded from Uganda, determined to reclaim their right to live in their homeland.

As the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front pushed steadily into Rwanda, the government mobilized the population into a genocidal frenzy, telling the Hutu that their very existence was in jeopardy. Between 1991 and 1993, killing a Tutsi was no longer seen as a crime. ""Even in 1990 people were getting killed,"" Mutuze says. ""At our factory things were getting worse by 1993. Senior Tutsi managers who were termed accomplices began to get killed. There was a lot of tension and we were very worried. We did not know what tomorrow would bring.""

By 1994, the regime's killing machine was in full cry. The United Nations, at the active instigation of the Clinton administration, was resistant to intervention; Washington was still reeling from the killing U.S. Army Rangers in Somalia in October 1993.

When the downing of the Rwandan presidential jet on the night of April 6, 1994, provided the spark for the final conflagration, every Tutsi in Kigali was running for cover. Mutuze sought refuge at the factory. But as supplies ran low and desperation rose, she ventured out on the afternoon of April 18, and ran smack into the roadblock where the first of her many rapists awaited.

Driven to Goma with the help of her factory manager, she would endure the refugee camp for the next two years.

A Long Trek Home
With life increasingly intolerable in the camps in Goma, Mutuze decided in 1996 that she had to find a way back home.

""I was so fed up and decided to walk back to Rwanda,"" she says. ""At that time I no longer cared whether I lived.""

More than a million Hutu refugees would follow her footsteps within a few weeks, but when Mutuze set off for Rwanda by foot, she met only the occasional straggler. The year-old Gervais was strapped to her back for the trek east through the Virunga range, and then southward to Gikongoro, and her ancestral village. The journey took three months, and it was all for naught. Her entire family had been butchered in the genocide, as had much of the local Tutsi population.

The genocidaires of Gikongoro, as those in neighboring Kibuye province, were particularly thorough in their ""work"" of exterminating the Tutsi. Even now, the killing has not completely stopped. In October last year a survivor was brutally murdered to prevent any possibility of testifying against some of the killers. In early March, five people were sentenced to die for the murder.

""The whole place was empty; it was ghostly,"" Mutuze says now. ""I did not spend even a single night in there. I kept walking."" After various detours for another year, she ended back in Kigali.

Mother and Son
Seven years after mother and son arrived in Kigali, their relationship remains highly conflicted. Gervais is desperate to win his mother's love, according to caseworkers from Avega, the widows association. ""You can see that the child unconditionally loves his mother,"" says Kayiganwa, who has worked closely with both, ""even after the abuse she sometimes inflicts on him.""

Mutuze admits to moments of intimacy shared with her son, though these are few, she says, and usually fleeting. She recalls taking him once to a wedding in the western town of Kibuye, and both stayed in a hotel for the first time and seemed to temporarily set aside their daily struggle. On occasion Gervais makes his mother breakfast porridge, and both sit down to share the meal. While she has no steady job and money is perennially scarce, now and then she finds enough to buy him candy -- ""which he likes very much"" -- just like her brother did when she was a child.

Kayiganwa, the Avega official, is not surprised by this. ""I can tell you as a mother,"" she says. ""There is one thing that cannot be erased, and that is a mother's love.""

Nevertheless, Mutuze says, her urge to be physically separated from Gervais remains close to overpowering.

""I can't say this is a child that brings me joy,"" she says. ""If you know anyone in America who would like to take this child, perhaps it would be better for him and for me."" Then she feels compelled to add: ""I feel like giving him away not just because I hate him but because I can't properly care for him. He could end up being a mayibobo [street child]. I don't feel that this is the life I would want for him.""

Were Mutuze to actually give the child up for adoption, Kayiganwa says the mother would likely be miserably unhappy and most certainly lonely. ""I think Gervais is someone that makes her life bearable,"" Kayiganwa says.

In all the many hours of conversations over several days, Mutuze never once refers to Gervais as ""my son,"" or even by name. Throughout, she speaks of him in an arms-length way, calling him ""this child,"" or ""that boy."" He is in third grade at an Italian-run school for orphans, but she doesn't know his teacher's name.

""Sometimes when I get annoyed with him I lash out about how he was born. I call him interahamwe, and it's out and too late before I can restrain myself,"" she says. ""He asks, 'But you say interahamwe are killers,' and I have to tell him he is not interahamwe.

""I have never seen this child being sad, despite the fact that I beat him and sometimes tell him that I am not his mother. He is an obedient child, but I don't know why I beat him often. When I go out and have a little money and I buy him something, I don't know why I do that either.""

To cope with her torment, Mutuze attends a support group of fellow survivors. Members of a Pentecostal congregation with whom she worships also drop by from time to time, she says, especially when she has recurring nightmares or thinks every other man she encounters in the street bears perfect resemblance to one of her assailants.

""It is comforting -- not really comforting, but you feel better,"" she says. ""I still feel suicidal when I remember the events of 1994, with all my family dead. I can't say that I have overcome. It is still a daily struggle. I don't know how I have survived all this so far.""

To fend off the attentions of men, she has worn a wedding band since 1999, like a crucifix that might ward off a vampire. Her opinion of men remains extremely low. ""Every man is a selfish individual who is a liar and who wants to take advantage of me,"" she says, with some vehemence. ""So I have decided I am never going that route in my life. Liars who only want to create problems for me. And I am not even beautiful. Why would anyone want someone like me?""

But even in the depths of her despair, she says she has reason to be thankful which, in retrospect, makes appropriate the choice of a name for her son. While sample studies have consistently shown a majority of rape victims were infected with HIV and thousands have died over the past decade, Mutuze is free of the virus. Her propensity to expect the worst out of life led her to distrust the initial negative test result. ""I had myself tested many times since I couldn't believe it,"" she says. ""But I don't have it."" What she does have is a son she has convinced herself she needs to give up.

""I just wish someone will adopt him so he has a chance at a good life in the future,"" Mutuze says. ""When he grows up and pursues a life of his own, I hope he will look at me as someone who tried to be a good mother, despite all the difficult circumstances."""
113,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"The first white man set foot in Rwanda only in the mid-1880s more than 400 years after Europeans landed on some parts of coastal Africa and well after the Atlantic slave trade had been brought to a merciful close.

This discovery was unfortunate for Rwandans, as the uninvited guest, a German, happened upon this mountain kingdom at a time when ""race science"" was all the rage in Europe.

As explorers, priests and Margaret Mead's ancestors trickled in over the next decade, they began to write extensively about their discovery of a superior race in the heart of Africa, whose supposedly ""Semitic"" physical features bore the closest resemblance to whites -- ""golden-haired beauties in Ruanda-Urundi."" One psuedo-scientist of the era speculated that these might even be citizens of the fabled lost continent of Atlantis.

The subject of this excitement were the Tutsi of Rwanda, a minority of the local population who largely exercised feudal authority and also were more prosperous, as herdsmen with a fungible asset, than the mainly pastoralist Hutu majority.

The Tutsi, tall and thin and not at all dissimilar from many other ethnic groups throughout central, east and West Africa, had wandered south into these mountains some 1,000 years ago and found the Hutu. The Hutu were a Bantu tribe, not at all dissimilar from any number of groups found throughout the continent. They had broader noses and thicker lips, and in the eyes of the visiting Europeans, were thus an inferior race. A much tinier aboriginal group, known as the Twa, completed the picture.

What the visitors failed to notice was that these were in fact not distinctive ethnic groups by any conventional definition. They spoke exactly the same language, observed the same rituals and followed the same system of social organization. They also observed a highly fluid system of social mobility, so that a Tutsi who fell on hard times could become Hutu, and vice versa. There were Tutsi chiefs and Hutu potentates. They also intermarried extensively, so that over time it became increasingly difficult to tell for sure who was what.

In 1885 at the Berlin Conference that partitioned Africa among European powers, Germany was allotted Rwanda. But the territory became a Belgian protectorate following the World War I. And that was when things really got messy.

The Belgians used the ruling elite to continue to run the country, but then instituted a system of identity cards that specified each person's ethnicity. The result was that this froze in place every Rwandan's identity, and social mobility was effectively halted.

The Hutu labored under the yoke of the feudalist Tutsi until after the World War II, when the independence movement in Africa influenced the Tutsi elite also to begin demanding the end of Belgian colonialism. The miffed Belgians shifted their allegiance to the Hutu, and in a bloody ""Hutu Power"" revolution in 1959 the Hutu began a decades-long purge of the Tutsi from all facets of Rwandan life.

Various pogroms forced hundreds of thousands of Tutsi into neighboring countries, especially Uganda and Burundi. In 1990, the children of those refugees formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front and invaded from Uganda, demanding power sharing and the return of the refugees.

The rebels' rapid advance steadily increased pressure on the Hutu government. Every Tutsi was seen as a collaborator, and the march toward a ""final solution"" to clear Rwanda of all Tutsi began in earnest."
114,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"The genocide was over, and Grace Chanzaire gathered her six children around her. Her husband was dead and other relatives were either dead or missing. She had something to tell the children, and she could count on no one else to help break the news.

Mother was pregnant, she told them, as a result of several weeks of rape by a neighbor, a member of the Hutu militia that spearheaded the nearly total extermination of members of her Tutsi minority. It was the price she had to pay, she said, to save the children and to save herself.

""I was in tears when I told them,"" Chanzaire says now, 10 years later. ""They began crying too. They could see my pain, and we cried together.""

Nadine Tumukunde turned 9 in February, and her six older siblings, ages 17 to 25, have over time formed her defensive line against a sometimes hostile world. She is being raised in a protective cocoon, made to understand she shares the same father with her siblings, and to feel that she is a normal child in every respect.

That her immediate family appears to have come to terms with the facts of Nadine's life is highly unusual in the charred emotional landscape of Rwanda, where an estimated 250,000 women were raped during the genocidal frenzy of 1994. Between 10,000 and 25,000 children were born of such rapes.

According to survivor groups and organizations tending to the country's rape victims, more typical for such women and their children has been social ostracism and familial dysfunction. An advocate for genocide widows speaks of a mother of two who was raped by her husband's killers. She then has to raise a child conceived from that rape along with the two older children, who knew that their father was killed by the biological father of their baby brother.

The most convoluted of Greek tragedies hardly begin to compare with such catastrophe.

""Many survivors get disappointed and feel quite depressed,"" says Adela Bamuzinre, a case worker with Avega, the association of genocide widows. ""And they think life is not worth living.""

In her Kigali neighborhood in 1994, some of Grace Chanzaire's Hutu neighbors, men and women alike, had joined the interahamwe militia, ready for the national assignment of wiping out every trace of the minority Tutsi from the land. Over 100 horrific days, some 800,000 people were murdered before the genocide was halted by Tutsi-led rebels.

But even as the capital turned into a necropolis, and dead bodies were stacked neatly on street corners and boulevard medians, a few of Chanzaire's neighbors remained loyal and sought to protect her and her children.

""Some good Hutu friends we used to go to church with took four of my children and pretended they were theirs,"" she says. But the other two children stayed with their mother because ""they looked too Tutsi"" to pass -- tall, thin, with the aquiline features of Somalis or the Fulani of West Africa.

They stayed home and cowered under beds while the genocidal fever raged on the outside. Chanzaire's Hutu tenant, a man named Mupanda, offered his protection, in exchange for her sharing his bed.

""This man was taking advantage of me, and after a while I discovered that I was pregnant,"" says Chanzaire, now 45. ""I could not afford to upset him, because my life depended on him and so did my children's.""

As with most pregnant rape victims, the Catholic woman at first felt shock, revulsion and panic, followed by shame and thoughts of abortion. ""I asked myself, what would I tell my children?""

Unusually, even miraculously, all of Chanzaire's six children, including the four in the custody of kindly Hutu neighbors, survived the genocide. In late July 1994, when she had to break the news of her pregnancy to them, the very fact of their survival, and the hints of humanity shown by the rapist, became the basis for her plea for the children's understanding, and their eventual acceptance of their baby sister.

Chanzaire says the rapist in fact did not initially force himself on her, until other members of the neighborhood interahamwe began to demand that he do so lest they handle it themselves. And when he finally did, Mupanda had first to fortify himself with strong drink, she says. He was no longer so reticent after the first time.

""I tried to impress the children that since the rapist did not kill me or the children, perhaps he was not irredeemably evil,"" she says. ""For this reason, you should love this child, your sibling."" It was a nervous and unhappy time. Nonetheless, she says, once Nadine was born, her brothers and sisters rallied around her.

""The older ones are so protective of her that they would not allow anyone to tell her that she has a different father,"" Chanzaire says.

But in a neighborhood so congested that most everyone's window opens on a neighbor's, inevitably whispers about Nadine sometimes penetrate the family's protective shield. A neighborhood drunk once told the little girl of her ""real"" father, but when she asked her siblings they told her to disregard it as the rantings of a drunkard.

""But by now she's aware that something is not quite right,"" her mother says.

Still, Grace Chanzaire seems determined to leave as much of the past as possible behind, concentrating instead on the sunnier aspects of life. A tall woman with the bearing of one who considers herself exceptionally fortunate, she smiles often and tries to cry little. Her children are doing well and she expects to be a grandmother in the next few months, thanks to her eldest daughter, Claire Umutoni, who recently got married.

""I am thankful that God has chosen to spare me and all my children,"" she says finally. ""I have to tell myself that I am not the worst off at the end of it all."""
115,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"As a young girl growing up here in the hills above the local monastery of the Benedictines, Regine Niyonsaba sometimes caught sight of the nuns, immaculate in their white habits, heads covered discreetly in the chocolate-brown scarves of the Belgian order.

While the nuns rarely left the monastery compound, each time Niyonsaba saw them she dreamed of one day entering the order, living in the impeccable monastery with like-minded sisters, and away from the uniform wretchedness of the poverty that otherwise defined life in this rural commune, barely five miles west of the southern university town of Butare.

At the age of 20, she enrolled as a novice.

But five years later her tranquil world of prayer and meditation was shattered at the outset of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, during which the government mobilized the Hutu majority to exterminate members of the minority Tutsi, such as herself.

Like thousands of other Tutsi fleeing the bloodbath, Niyonsaba's family had sought refuge in the monastery compound. But the mother superior, a Hutu whipped up by the official incitement to murder, had invited in the militias and local officials carrying out the genocide, saying the presence of the refugees was a threat to her domain.

The mother superior, Sister Gertrude Mukangango, insisted that the relatives of nuns also be expelled from their sanctuary in the monastery's guest quarters, knowing full well that she was sending them to their deaths, as numerous witnesses, human rights organizations and Belgian prosecutors would later establish.

Niyonsaba's father and brother already had been killed elsewhere in the monastery compound in the preceding 15 days, along with nearly 7,000 others.

And now, on May 6, 1994, under the gun of a police officer, Niyonsaba followed her mother and two younger sisters down a footpath to a banana grove on the far side of the compound. They were accompanied by another nun, Sister Fortunata Mukagasana, whose relatives also were slated for execution that Monday afternoon.

The police officer, Francois-Xavier Munyeshyaka, was in fact doing Niyonsaba's family a favor of sorts. In consideration for a sum of 7,000 Rwandan francs, he had agreed to shoot the novice's mother and sisters rather than leave their fates in the hands of the militia, who favored the use of machetes and nail-studded clubs.

""We asked him why he was killing our families. Why? He said the mission he was given was that no nun should be killed, but all the others must die,"" Niyonsaba recalled recently. ""We buried them at the spot where they were killed.""

Dazed from the execution, Niyonsaba stumbled back to her quarters and locked herself in. But since that afternoon in the banana grove, Niyonsaba knew that her days as a nun were numbered and, soon after the genocide ended, she walked away from it all.

""Ever since,"" says Niyonsaba, now 35, ""I lost hope in the spiritual life. I lost faith in my life as a nun.""

The massacre at Sovu monastery has recast the lives of many of its nuns who survived the genocide. The trauma cut some loose from their religious moorings and sent them to seek the less exalted experiences of the secular life. Yet others profess even more fervor for their faith, seeing it as the price to pay for having been spared. Nine of the original 36 nuns were killed during the genocide. Six remain, and the rest quit the order.

The travails of the nuns in many respects reflect the spiritual wilderness many Rwandans inhabit today.

Ten years after the genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed, the question of personal faith has become a profoundly disorienting one for many in Africa's most overwhelmingly Christian -- and overwhelmingly Catholic -- country. The moral crisis triggered by the decimation has compelled many survivors to re-examine their relationship with the church -- and with Christianity in general.

Aiding and Abetting
Some of the worst massacres occurred right inside churches and parish compounds, many with the active collaboration of priests.

Many other priests risked everything to save lives, and more than 200 of them were believed murdered along with their parishioners. One particularly courageous priest, Father Boniface Senyenzi, who was Hutu, stood steadfast with the thousands who sought refuge in the Roman Catholic Church in the lakeside city of Kibuye. He was killed, along with 11,400 people in the church.

But many more became foot soldiers in the extermination campaign or passively accepted its inevitability. Among the most notorious was Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, the first priest to be convicted of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, which is trying a few of the leaders.

In his Kigali church Munyeshyaka presided gleefully over the mass murder, egged his congregation on to greater effort in their ""work,"" and often read from a list of those Tutsi who must die. The mother superior at Sovu, too, is serving a 15-year sentence in a Belgian prison.

Throughout Rwanda the smashed skulls of the innocent are in church pews still as a memorial. In the church in Ntarama, south of Kigali, more than 5,000 perished at the hands of government armed killers. And at Nyarubuye, the priests gave up thousands of Tutsi parishioners who sought sanctuary at the only place they thought they could safely turn.

As a result of what many survivors see as treachery, the primacy of the Catholic church in civic and spiritual life in Rwanda has come under increasing strain. Estrangement from the church has pushed many into the willing arms of evangelicals. Others appear to have turned their backs on Christianity altogether, seeking refuge in Islam, which had few adherents as a percentage of this country's population of about 8 million. Yet others have abandoned religion entirely.

Accurate statistics are hard to come by in Rwanda. But experts say the genocide has helped demystify the Catholic Church, easing the way for many of its adherents to flock to the proselytizing evangelical churches whose revival tents sprout like toadstools throughout the Kigali metropolitan area.

""The evangelical Christians -- the born-agains -- they are growing very fast,"" says Privat Rutazibwa, a former Catholic priest who was inducted by John Paul II on Sept. 8, 1990, when the pope visited Rwanda. ""They have attracted people who have been overwhelmed by problems and need an external force to help them."" Rutazibwa felt compelled to quit the priesthood but remains a Catholic, though an openly skeptical one.

Archbishop's Response
The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Rwanda, Archbishop Thaddée Ntihinyurwa, acknowledged a flight from the church by an indeterminate portion of his flock. This, the archbishop hinted most certainly reflects poor judgment.

""If they think by leaving the church they can live better lives, it's their choice,"" he said one recent Saturday afternoon in his Kigali office. ""Christianity is not about numbers, but about those who have accepted Jesus in their lives.""

And despicable as the genocide was, said the archbishop, and as impermeable to Christ's teachings many citizens proved to be, in the end nothing that happened here in 1994 was unprecedented or even uniquely Rwandan.

""Many have asked, how can a Christian country do this? My answer is you can't talk only about Rwanda; talk about human beings who have not accepted Christ in their hearts,"" Ntihinyurwa says. ""There have been genocides in other countries, and the first genocides happened in Christian countries also, like Germany and Armenia.""

The official line laid down by the Vatican, and still followed by the church hierarchy in Rwanda, is that individual priests, and not the church, must be held accountable for the genocide.

Church and State
With the possible exception of the government, the Roman Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in Rwanda. It always had been intertwined with the political establishment. The church ran 60 percent of Rwandan schools, even enforcing strict quotas that limited Tutsi enrollment to their proportion of the overall population. It operated clinics and relief services. In the rural areas, which accounted for nearly 90 percent of the population, often the church functioned effectively like the social services department of the government.

Until the pope ended the practice in 1990, the archbishop was a member of the ruling council of the ruling party, whose primary ideology of Hutu Power defined itself as anti-Tutsi, and eventually metamorphosed into a campaign to turn Rwanda into the exclusive preserve of the Hutu majority.

Ntihinyurwa's predecessor, Archbishop Vincent Nsengiyumva, was a member of the Hutu Power cabinet that presided over the genocide. (He was killed in June 1994 in a revenge shooting by rebel soldiers, who held him responsible for the genocide.) Church documents show that priests even adopted the language of the genocidaires, routinely referring to Tutsi as inyenzi, or cockroaches.

Today the church co-exists warily with the government of President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi whose rebel Rwandan Patriotic Force halted the genocide by defeating the army of the old regime. Several priests have been found guilty of complicity in the genocide, and dozens remain in jail, along with some 100,000 genocide suspects. The most senior cleric charged so far, a bishop, was found not guilty.

""In the beginning the government blamed the church for not stopping the genocide,"" Archbishop Ntihinyurwa says. ""The church defense was that our only weapon was the word of God, and the word of God was no longer being listened to.""

Violence in Butare
The genocide commenced in earnest after the plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down on the night of April 6, 1994, as it approached Kigali airport. But the violence took nearly two weeks to spread to Butare province, alone of the country's 12 prefectures in initially resisting state-sanctioned murder.

Mild-mannered in its climate and moderate in its politics -- perhaps on account of the concentration of the country's intellectuals at the National University -- Butare set itself apart for a while from the genocidal frenzy radiating outward from Kigali to the rest of the country. Opposition Hutu politicians predominated in the province, which also had the country's only Tutsi prefect, Jean-Baptiste Habyarimana.

Hutu were reluctant to kill Tutsi and, so, on April 19, 1994, the interim president, Theodore Sindikubwabo, a Butare native, visited Butare to rally local officials. He expressed disappointment that they were failing to carry out their communal responsibility -- their umuganda -- by not mobilizing the population to de-Tutsify the prefecture. That same day, mass killings began throughout the region. The Tutsi were on the run. In April 1994, as the Tutsi of these parts were driven from their homesteads and sorghum fields by drunken members of the interahamwe militia, they began to funnel downhill toward the monastery, seeking refuge. Some had family there, but most simply acted on the assumption that the only inviolable sanctuary available to them was the house of God.

It was not an unreasonable assumption. In all the previous anti-Tutsi pogroms, in 1959 and then in 1961-63, there's no record of anyone ever killed within a church compound.

The monastery sits near the base of a series of hills. At its entrance is a large health center. An immaculately kept garden dotted with gazebos conveys a sense of tranquility. The administrative building complex, where the monastery intersects as needed with the secular world, sits at the end of the driveway. Church buildings and other facilities are scattered around and about. And partially hidden from view are the nuns' quarters.

Above the monastery the hills rise into the distance, covered by pine, stands of eucalyptus, and banana groves. The land, to paraphrase the South African writer Alan Paton, is green and rolling, and is beautiful beyond any singing of it.

A Malevolent Duo
The assumption by the frightened Tutsi of the inviolability of the monastery did not count on the simmering malevolence of the mother superior, Sister Mukagango, and her deputy, Sister Julienne Kisito.

""Our family members ran to the monastery expecting to find sanctuary,"" says Bernadette Kayitesi, a nun who also left the order in the aftermath of the genocide. ""But what happened -- our mother superior was the one who began requesting for the militia to come and kill them.""

Over the coming days, Kayitesi's two brothers hiding in the compound would be killed as the mother superior worked closely with the interahamwe -- ""those who fight together"" -- to clean the refugees out of the monastery compound. ""I did not know,"" Kayitesi would marvel today, shaking her head, ""how a person we thought was good came to be so evil.""

Within two days, about 7,000 Tutsi were packed into the monastery compound, most at the health center near the main entrance. According to other nuns, the mother superior grew increasingly agitated, saying the militia should get rid of the refugees and insisting that she didn't want to jeopardize the monastery. In interviews in Belgium before she was convicted in June 2001, Mukangango denied collaborating with killers. ""These charges against me are false because they attribute to me intentions I never had,"" she told Belgian television.

But like many other witnesses, Anunciata Mukagasana, one of the Sovu nuns who is Tutsi, says the mother superior acted promptly to turn the refugees over to the killers.

""As the refugees came, her heart hardened,"" she says of Mukangango. ""She worked closely with Rekeraho, who was in the monastery every day.""

For three months in 1994, Emmanuel Rekeraho was the most-feared man in Sovu. A retired army warrant officer, he took charge of the militia and directed the attacks on the refugees seeking shelter in the monastery. He also was given use of the monastery's minivan, and held meetings daily with the mother superior and her second in command, Sister Kisito.

""I had good relations with the sisters,"" he says in an interview on death row in Butare Central Prison. ""We were working together as one.""

Rekeraho described how he coordinated repeated attacks on the refugees barricaded inside the health center, using grenades and rifle fire, and then directing the militia to finish off survivors with studded clubs and cutlasses. A few hundred hiding in a nearby parking garage were simply burned alive, with gasoline allegedly supplied by Kisito, whose brothers were members of the interahamwe.

In his hot-pink prison uniform, Rekeraho affects the befuddlement of someone whose actions were so extreme they were a surprise even to himself. ""In those days, people had been turned to animals,"" he says. ""You should have seen the faces -- just like animals.

""I accept a role in the killings, by commanding the militia who were there,"" he adds, ""but I cannot accept that I am one of the architects of the genocide.""

Rekeraho, 65, is aware that the ""architects"" are the only ones the government is not prepared to grant amnesty. In 1999 he was sentenced to die, but the sentence has not been carried out by the government because officials are debating whether to ban capital punishment.

Refuge in Belgium
Like Regine Niyonsaba, whose family paid to be shot rather than hacked to death, Anunciata Mukagasana fled disillusioned from the monastery, unable to reconcile what she witnessed with the tenets of her faith.

""I couldn't imagine that people could be killed in a place like that, in God's house,"" she says. ""The monastery was very big and it had many hiding places. But Sister Kisito and the mother superior, they were never merciful at all. They used ladders to check if people were hiding on the roofs. The did not have the hearts of Christians.""

Once the mainly Tutsi forces overran the country and the genocide ended, the sisters were evacuated to the main abbey of the Benedictines in Maredret, Belgium. As they left the monastery, the surrounding countryside bore every evidence of the horror. ""We drove away and there were dead bodies everywhere, by the roadside, everywhere,"" Mukagasana says. ""We were just waiting for death. We could not imagine that we would survive.""

But so distraught were many of the nuns that, as soon as they arrived in Belgium, they started denouncing the mother superior. They were shocked, however, by the reaction of the church authorities, who rallied behind Sisters Mukangango and Kisito and tried to suppress any information about their complicity.

""We were more than surprised that the church in Belgium was supporting her -- it was painful,"" Mukagasana says. ""The whites thought that the mother superior was a saint, until they came here in 1995 to take testimony from witnesses. They had thought we just hated her.""

Angered and demoralized by the attitude of the church leaders, Scholastique Mukangira, one of the Sovu nuns, demanded that she be allowed to return to Rwanda at once. She had lost two relatives in the monastery massacre, forced into the hands of the interahamwe by the mother superior. She had coped with the killings by praying with ever more dedication, at one point, she said, directly asking for divine intervention.

""I asked Jesus myself, 'Do you accept that all of us should be killed, and wipe out this order?'"" she says one recent morning in the reception hall of the monastery. 'I know you are kind and you have power over everything. Use your power to save some of us, so that the order might not perish.'

""That gave me the strength to carry on. I was no longer afraid of death. I was strengthened throughout the war that, no matter what happened I shall be with Jesus.""

'She Rebuilt Us'
That this serene compound was the scene of one of the worst atrocities of 10 years ago is today not readily apparent. That nascent recovery is the handiwork, in large part, of the current mother superior, Anastasie Mukamusoni.

Sister Mukamusoni took over the defiled institution in 1995, rallied the six remaining nuns to take eternal vows to rededicate their lives to the service of Christ, admitted nine new novices and methodically set about the task of revival.

A shy woman with a perpetually mournful look, the mother superior spoke softly and gazed constantly downward, talking with evident discomfort about the monastery's progress.

""When you are building the body you have to start with the soul,"" she says. ""We have to start with the renewal of our faith with the church."" Sister Mukangira returned home and found her way back to the monastery, where she remains today, working with the new mother superior to try to pick up the pieces of a ministry destroyed.

""During the genocide, because of what I saw, I can say that God did not have a role in the genocide,"" she says. ""And we cannot say that all Christians failed their religion. There were many who did the right thing."" At this, she cast a glance at the mother superior, who looked embarrassed and seemed to want to hide. Mukamusoni, then a 40-year-old nun, was away on church business in the border town of Gisenyi when the genocide came to the Sovu monastery. A Hutu, she is said to have arranged secret convoys to take Tutsi across the border to safety in neighboring Congo.

""She protected those who were being hunted,"" Mukangira says. ""And she was the very person who called us back from Belgium. She rebuilt this place. She not only rebuilt the monastery but she rebuilt us.""

While Mukangira has found reason to believe, and to continue life as a nun, Anunciata Mukagasana said she had no choice but to turn her back on the Benedictine Order.

""I just wanted to take a break from it because I would run mad if I stayed there,"" she says. Her family, which had fled to neighboring Burundi at the outset of the genocide, had returned home, and she wanted to care for her parents. So she cast off her habit and enrolled in nursing school, and today she is a pediatric nurse at University Hospital in Butare, the only one with a job in her extended family of 14, including her younger sister's three children.

The family lives in neat but cramped conditions in the Matyazo district of Butare, in a neighborhood of few means and multitudes of malnourished children. In Mukagasana's household, food is often in short supply. ""It is a life of hardship, and sometimes it's hard to find milk for the children,"" she says with an embarrassed laugh. ""The meals are not decent, but there is no other option.""

At this, Mukagasana's voice caught just a bit, and she asked for a glass of water to steady herself. The living room was painted coral blue, the best to cheer up its threadbare condition. The walls were decorated with the inevitable portraits of Jesus, who is said to be constance -- eternal.

The portraits were an indication of the continuing hold of Christianity on Mukagasana's imagination. Despite everything, she said, she remained a good Christian and believed in God, even if she no longer quite trusted His earthly messengers.

""There are those who turned their backs on Christianity altogether, after what they experienced,"" she says. ""I think to some extent they have reason. They've lost everything, and it seems God forgot them. But I go to church because whatever happened, God did not have a hand in it.""

Besides, Mukagasana adds, ""Other people died, but it was due to God's mercy that I survived. It was due to God's mercy that my family was able to escape to Burundi.""

Reason to Believe
Regine Niyonsaba did not have the luxury of her family's company. Her father and brother had been killed at the monastery's health center, and she had witnessed the execution of her mother and two younger sisters, and buried them with her own hands. When she returned from Belgium with several of the other Sovu nuns, she concluded that her life had been permanently altered.

""Life at the monastery had become impossible for me,"" she says. ""I couldn't see myself praying there anymore."" Besides, she had one 11-year-old sister, Florentina Nwambaye, who survived the genocide, and she felt responsible for her. So she took a secretarial job at a local school, then later, at a pharmaceutical firm.

""One of the things that keeps me going is prayer,"" says the former novice, who packs every day with distractions to help her retain a hold on sanity. For spiritual support, she attends morning sessions of a charismatic Catholic community. She holds down a day job, and afterward rushes off to the university, where she's taking evening classes for a degree in sociology.

""I have had no time to think about the past,"" she says. ""It took me a long time to adjust. It is not easy for me."" After a decade-long struggle, including bouts of depression and moments of rage, Niyonsaba said she had reached an accommodation with her faith.

""Since the passage of 10 years, instead of demoralizing myself, I thought it was not only me who had lost relatives because of church leaders' role in the genocide,"" she says. ""I was not the only witness to the scandals in the church. I thought God had helped me to survive. Genocide wasn't planned by God. He gave us knowledge, free will, to do the right thing. God never plans for bad things to happen.""

But doesn't necessarily prevent them, either?

Prim in a checkered custard suit with a sensible skirt, Niyonsaba pondered the question for a moment, her charcoal-black face set off against the stark blankness of the wall, serene in the soft glow of the fluorescent light. She turned slowly away, silent.

""How can a Rwandan continue to identify as a Christian?,"" Rutazibwa, the former priest, asked rhetorically regarding the endurance of faith. ""That is part of the mystery of the faith. Despite the horrors, people always need a relationship with a supreme being.""

At the monastery, the current mother superior said all she could do now was carry on her calling, which is to serve God. ""I saw others die, but I stayed alive,"" she says. ""Since I took the eternal vow, the only thing to do was stay here and serve the Lord. That was the only way I could pay back the gift of life that I was given.""

And with that, she rose and walked out to the garden, down a footpath, and to a mass grave in which nine of her fellow nuns killed during the genocide were buried. She observed a moment of meditative silence, did the sign of the cross, and headed back to the well-ordered sanctuary of her domain."
116,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"To get as far away as possible from her former life as a nun, Bernadette Kayitesi got married five years ago and had a son. The wedding, she noted, was at a registry, not a church. She even changed her first name from Marie-Bernard -- ""that was my nun name"" -- to leave no doubt in her own mind that this was anything but a fresh start.

Kayitesi is seeking refuge in the temporal world, which to her has every appearance of being superior to the life she had chosen as a nun of the Benedictine Order, sequestered away in the monastery at Sovu, in southern Rwanda.

The 1994 genocide stripped her of any illusions of the holy community of sisters that she had imagined when she entered the order in 1986.

""I thought this was a joyful place to be, a hopeful place to be, where I could serve God,"" she says, holding on to her 4-year-old son, Clement Gasangwa, in their Kigali home one recent evening. ""I became a nun expecting that I would be in a place of sisters in the faith, of family members. But it did not turn out that way.""

Ten years ago, as the government mobilized the majority Hutu to kill all members of the minority Tutsi in furtherance of a goal of a Hutu-only country, many Tutsi who lived in hilltop villages around the monastery, just outside the town of Butare, sought refuge on the grounds of the monastery. Among them were two of Kayitesi's brothers.

But the mother superior, acting as many religious leaders did, called in the killers instead. Kayitesi's brothers were butchered, along with about 7,000 others. Nine of the 36 nuns also were killed.

""This was a total betrayal of everything I believed in,"" she says. ""It totally upset everything I had assumed.""

Her shaken faith was delivered a final blow after the surviving nuns were evacuated to the headquarters of their order in Belgium at the end of the genocide. There, an embarrassed church hierarchy reacted to the scandal by rallying behind the accused mother superior, Gertrude Mukangango, and her deputy, Sister Julienne Kisito. The nuns denouncing them, including Kayitesi, were ostracized and many of them returned to Rwanda angry and disappointed.

In August 1995, the order sent a white priest, the Rev. Andre Comblin, who had once lived in Rwanda, to try to persuade the nuns to write a statement absolving the mother superior of any responsibility for the monastery massacre. They refused.

""This persuaded me that there was nothing about God going on here,"" Kayitesi says.

With attempts to cover up for the mother superior fast crumbling, Belgian authorities arrested her and Sister Kisito and held them in jail facing allegations of genocide. In June 2002, both were finally convicted and sentenced to 15 and 12 years respectively.

In January 1996, five months after the visit from Comblin, Kayitesi finally left the order and moved to Kigali to stay for a while with her sister, supporting herself with petty trading in consumer goods.

""When I walked out of there I felt a certain relief,"" she says, ""but also sadness that what I had dedicated my life to was coming to an end.""

She met Onesphore Gasangwa, who worked at an orphanage, after an aunt introduced them in 1998. A year later, they married. In May 2000, Clement was born. His mother was 41 then. While Kayitesi runs her stall in the local market, her husband is studying full-time for a degree in sociology.

Their home gives every appearance of a life restarted. It is sparsely furnished, but spacious and neatly kept. The only decorations on the walls are images of Jesus, suffering the children to come to him.

This new life, Kayitesi says, suits her just fine. ""Compared with what others suffer, I am doing very well,"" she says. ""I have not lost everything.""

For this reason, she says, she clings to some faith that Christianity transcends its earthly representatives, that God remains good despite everything that happened. So she goes to church on Sunday, with Gasangwa and their little boy, close enough to her religion but, perhaps, not enough to be singed again.

She says she wished a way could be found to compensate the survivors, but that suing the church might be wishful thinking. ""How can you sue the church?"" she says, a tone of awe noticeable in her voice. ""What court do you take the church to? The church is too powerful. It is beyond the reach of people like us."""
117,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide," At times, a smoldering anger consumes Marguerite Mukabazanira. Her normally friendly face is contorted and she starts to hiss.

She is mad at the Rwandan government, which she regards as craven for letting killers walk free in the name of national reconciliation. She despises former neighbors, whom she holds responsible for the murder of her husband and all her five children.

But she reserves something akin to pure hatred for her former best friend and the godmother to her youngest child, Olive Mukarugagi, under whose protection Delphine Umutesi, 7, was placed, only to be handed over to the killers.

""She is the one who killed my youngest child,"" Mukabazanira declares, sitting stiff-backed in her temporary home in this southern town. ""Ever since the war ended, I have never been at peace, because I always see people who killed my relatives, my family, roaming around. Many were close friends before the genocide. I was the teacher of their children. But no one lifted a finger to help us.""

Mukarugagi, 40, sits for now in Butare Central Prison, where she has been held for the past seven years on charges of conspiring to murder little Delphine, as well as for the crime of genocide. Mukarugagi admits that the child had been placed in her care, but insists that her husband's family had taken her away to be killed in the street. She was powerless, she says, to stop them.

""Marguerite is furious and bitter, which is understandable,"" she says. ""But I was not responsible. My husband's uncle killed her. I had nothing to do with it.""

Perhaps sometime this month, Mukarugagi will walk out of Butare Central Prison. She will be freed provisionally as part of a government program to release most of the 130,000 genocide suspects who have been held for years in prisons so overcrowded that inmates take turns to sleep. Last year about 23,000 suspects deemed to be mere foot soldiers during the genocide, or who were seriously ill, were sent back to their villages. Any day now, another 30,000 will be similarly released conditionally. Only a few thousand regarded as the architects of the genocide, or who demonstrated especially depraved enthusiasm for killing, will eventually be tried in regular courts.

The vast majority of suspects, such as Mukarugagi, will be required to appear only before traditional open-air tribunals of village notables, who will begin to sit in judgment sometime this month in communities throughout Rwanda. In exchange for a full public confession, those found guilty will be sentenced mostly to time already served, community service and perhaps be required to pay compensation to survivors, such as helping to rebuild a home destroyed.

By resorting to this compromise, the Rwandan government is only facing the reality that the very magnitude of the crime committed 10 years ago puts it beyond the possibility of just sanction.

On April 7, 1994, a day after a plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down and he was killed, units of government soldiers, police and Hutu militia organized and funded by the government began implementing a carefully planned program of mass eradication directed at the country's Tutsi minority. The ruling party's ideology of Hutu Power saw no room for coexistence with the Tutsi, whose rebel forces eventually stopped the genocide, though too late to save about 80 percent of the Tutsi population. Within 100 days, an estimated 800,000 Tutsi, and Hutu opposed to the genocide, had been killed. From a distance, the world watched.

A 'Nation in Prison'
For scale and speed, the genocide was the most efficiently carried out in recorded history, with people being killed, mostly with machetes, at a rate seven times faster than in the Nazi Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were killed.

The total mobilization of the Hutu population, which accounted for about 85 percent of Rwanda's 8 million people, made it possible.

And made justice virtually impossible.

""There was never any real possibility of justice,"" says Rakiya Omaar, executive director of the London-based humanitarian group African Rights and a leading authority on the genocide. ""The degree of popular participation was so deep and widespread that it would be like putting the whole nation in prison.""

Rwanda's ministry of justice estimates that for every suspect detained, six others were left alone, which would put the number of direct participants in the genocide in the neighborhood of 1 million. At the current pace of judicial proceedings, Rwandan courts would literally still be trying genocide cases for the next century, long after the suspects are dead, officials say.

The situation is complicated by the fact Rwanda has a death penalty.

""It was a question of making a choice, whether to attempt real justice and thereby create legalized genocide, or attempt to balance the desire to eradicate impunity while allowing the country to move on,"" says Martin Ngoga, the deputy attorney general. ""We were not in a position to enforce the law.""

Rwanda's judicial system was at any rate destroyed during the genocide. Almost all the country's lawyers either were killed or fled into exile. Meanwhile, many of the suspects already are in their 10th year of detention, with no prospects of a trial date in the foreseeable future.

So the authorities reached into the country's past for a form of traditional conflict resolution that strives less for retribution than for reconciliation. ""Our larger purpose is we want Rwandans to be Rwandans again,"" Ngoga says. ""The genocide succeeded, but we want people, nevertheless, to live together. There is no other practical way.""

Gacaca: On the Grass
After a two-year pilot program to adapt them to today's realities, 9,010 village tribunals, called Gacaca courts, will begin trying suspects from this month, says Charles Kayitana, spokesman for the program.

For a preparatory session of a Gacaca (pronounced gah-CHA-CHA) court near the southeastern town of Kibungo, villagers have gathered within a cluster of mango trees. Members of the tribunal, known as ""the wise men and women,"" sit on a wooden bench while residents squat before them in a semicircle on the grass. Gacaca literally means ""on the grass.""

About two dozen suspects have been trucked in from the local prison. In their flamingo-pink uniforms, they stand out from their former neighbors, family and friends, who are all required to be in attendance so no one can pretend not to know the enormity of the crimes that were committed in their name.

The subject at hand stands in sharp contrast to the extravagant beauty of the surroundings. The hills roll off in the distance, all shades of green. The earth is red where turned or is otherwise carpeted in kikuyu grass and the inevitable profusion of banana trees and cassava. The sky is blue, like cobalt, and white and gray clouds drift over the land.

The presiding ""wise woman"" states the purpose of the gathering, leads the assembled in a moment of silence for the dead and starts the proceedings.

The sessions follow a more or less prescribed pattern: charges are read, survivors testify, naming some in the pink uniforms who allegedly used guns and sharp knives on their neighbors a decade ago. One by one the accused stand to state their case, invariably involving at least a partial confession. ""It is participatory,"" Kayitana says. ""It is by Rwandans, for Rwandans.""

Justice Under Fire
But Gacaca has been criticized by some international human rights organizations for falling far short of the presumed balance and the protection of the accused's rights that regular courts afford. Significantly, the system does not allow for defense attorneys, and few suspects can resist the coercive power of the leniency promised in exchanged for a full confession. A presumption of innocence is not the system's strength.

Rwandan officials typically treat such criticism with dismissal.

""If there is a bar association somewhere that is willing to lend us 12,000 lawyers, we're happy to accept them,"" Ngoga says. ""We have learned to ignore this nonsense. We decided to deal with our situation in the manner that suits our needs.""

This homegrown solution offers little comfort to Cyriaque Habyarabatuma, the chief of police in Butare province under the old regime. For the past 10 years Habyarabatuma appeared to have pulled off an unusually seamless transition from serving the genocidal regime to serving the current one in similar capacities.

But a survivor denounced him at a recent Gacaca session for personally directing police officers a decade ago to mow down the innocent. On the evening of Feb. 6 police executed a warrant for his arrest, and now Habyarabatuma finds himself within the confines of the impossibly overcrowded Butare Central Prison, along with 10,814 other inmates.

Because of the importance of his position, Habyarabatuma may not qualify for trial under the more lenient Gacaca system, which cannot try ""Category One"" offenders. As a result, he disavows any involvement in the genocide, a position of moral heroism that a police commander almost certainly would have been unable to maintain during the genocide. Habyarabatuma says he is a victim of wrongful accusation.

""Not all who are in prison killed; sometimes there are false accusations,"" he says, suggesting strongly that this unfortunate state of affairs clearly applies to himself. ""Problems arise when you release the guilty but hold the innocent.""

A Reluctant Killer
By contrast, Cyriaque Sebera is counting the days to his return home for the first time in nine years. The farmer from Gashora, in southern Rwanda, first confessed six years ago to killing his neighbor, but the system was not ready to accommodate people like him. Now prison officials have notified him that he is on a list of those scheduled for provisional release, and might soon be allowed home to face a Gacaca court.

""I collaborated with others to kill the Tutsi of this area,"" he says. ""There was a feeling we could get away with anything. In my area from 1992 to 1994, killing a Tutsi was not a crime.""

Sebera, 50, confesses to direct responsibility for only one killing, the murder of a Tutsi neighbor and fellow farmer. But he killed only with reluctance, he swears, and only because he had no real choice. The pressure to join in the killing was severe, with the implied threat that whoever failed to participate was liable to be killed as a Tutsi-lover.

For this reason, he says hopefully, the Gacaca court will look kindly on him and, perhaps, his neighbors will accept him back. This has proved true for his son, who was released last year, he says.

""The survivors know that I tried hard to avoid killing,"" he says, ""but there came a time when I could no longer resist.""

During the genocide, the interahamwe militia, which carried out most of the killing, was indeed merciless with dissenters. Those hesitant to kill their neighbors, teachers or goddaughters were judged to be just as traitorous as the inyenzi, or cockroach, the name applied to all Tutsi. In this way, thousands of moderate Hutu were killed throughout the country in the last lunge by extremists to cleanse the land of the Tutsi.

""In April 1994,"" says Emile Rwamasirabo, rector of National University of Rwanda, ""it was more dangerous to refuse to kill than to kill.""

And while a confessed killer, such as Sebera, will probably be set free in exchange for time served, Gacaca courts still will be playing an invaluable role in the building of a new society of tolerance and rule of law, Rwamasirabo says.

""If you killed a Tutsi over the past 40 years in the name of Hutu Power there was no punishment,"" he says. ""So today the simple act of recognizing it as a crime, of taking people to court, of public confession, already is a big leap forward.""

The UN Tribunal
For its acknowledged sin of what can only be charitably described as moral cowardice, the international community, through the agency of the United Nations, also is hoping a similar public accounting will have a large symbolic impact.

Even its genocide tribunal's most bitter critics, including Ngoga, ascribe it significant value, however begrudgingly.

""This tribunal was not created to get us justice, but to nurse the guilt of the international community,"" says Ngoga, who was Rwanda's representative to the tribunal for four years. ""But its mere existence has served a certain usefulness -- the international community officially recognized that a genocide occurred here.""

Merely recognizing genocide now is counted as a virtue because the world's leading nations were reluctant to grant even that much in 1994. The French government supported and supplied the Hutu Power regime until the very end. The Clinton administration, smarting from the killing of two dozen U.S. Army Rangers in Somalia the previous October, actively dissuaded the UN from intervening. The UN itself turned a deaf ear to the desperate importunings of the commander of its peacekeeping force of 450 troops in Rwanda. After the genocide, the commander, Canadian Gen. Romeo Dallaire, fell into depression and tried several times to commit suicide.

In a nondescript building in the East African town of Arusha, in Tanzania, the genocide tribunal sits in judgment. After nine years and more than $1.5 billion maintaining a vast apparatus of administrators and lawyers, the tribunal has so far convicted fewer than two dozen genocide suspects. It is on course to fail even to prosecute all the 65 suspects now trickling through its chambers before its mandate expires in 2007.

Yet for all its bumbling the tribunal has in custody some of the most prominent planners of the genocide, including the former prime minister, Jean Kambanda, as well as the chief of the army and various cabinet ministers.

But none is more important than the man widely acknowledged as the genocide mastermind, Col. Théoneste Bagosora, deputy commander of the Armed Forces of Rwanda. His trial is finally under way and is expected to be concluded sometime this year.

In late January in a bulletproof courtroom in Arusha, Bagosora sits impassive, lips pursed and eyes vacant, listening to Dallaire testify against him.

The Canadian general, now retired, recently published ""Shake Hands With the Devil,"" his best-selling account of his failure to persuade the world to act against Bagosora and his comrades. The ""devil"" refers to Bagosora, who Dallaire now describes as ""the kingpin"" of the Hutu Power leadership that planned and set the genocide in motion.

Bagosora had kept detailed plans of the genocide in a journal that was subsequently retrieved. He also organized and armed the interahamwe, and got his associates to import enough machetes from China to arm one-third of Rwanda's entire population.

But in the courtroom his UN-paid attorneys are doing their best to challenge the very idea that a genocide took place at all, let alone whether their client was its chief executioner. The entire proceedings -- the red-robed judges and black-gowned lawyers, the endless arguments about the finer points of semantics, the rhetorical detours -- seem completely disconnected from the reality of Rwanda's existence.

After a week of testimony, Dallaire is excused. The general stands ramrod at attention, stares for what seems like a full minute at Bagosora, then finally pivots and marches out of the room. Bagosora only looks straight ahead, constantly pushing his big round glasses up the bridge of his nose.

Dallaire expresses relief afterward. ""I've been waiting a long time to testify,"" he says. ""I will never be finished with Rwanda, and all those connected to it will never be finished. The horror and the destruction will not allow me to be finished with it.""

Last month, during ceremonies to mark the start of the genocide, Dallaire returned to Rwanda for the first time, talking to young people, apologizing for failing to protect the innocent and wiping away tears.

Neighbor to Neighbor
The tears flow freely for Marguerite Mukabazanira, alone in the world but for six genocide orphans she has informally adopted, who keep her company and allow her, at age 50, to be a mother again.

""Who will give us justice?"" she asks in the tone of someone who already knows the answer. ""The government is too interested in reconciling with the killers.""

A school teacher, she was married to Onesphore Murekezi on July 23, 1978, and the two made their home that very day in the hilltop village of Mpare, just outside Butare. Life was hard for Tutsi anywhere in Rwanda but less so in Butare, a temperamental equivalent perhaps of California, where the climate soothed and the citizens were relaxed in their habits and friendly in their ways.

The couple became close to many of their Hutu neighbors, especially Olive Mukarugagi's family. She and Mukabazanira taught at the same school, Musange Primary, and their husbands were both in the brick-making business.

""Before the genocide the two families were so close, and we often exchanged presents,"" Mukarugagi says during a prison interview.

In 1987, after Delphine was born, her parents naturally asked Mukarugagi to be her godmother. In fact, all four of her older siblings also had Hutu godparents.

Neighborhood ties began to fray from about 1990, after the Tutsi rebel force, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, invaded from neighboring Uganda with the objective of forcing Rwanda to take back hundreds of thousands of its Tutsi citizens who had been driven into exile in repeated pogroms since 1959.

Government propaganda began to characterize all Tutsi as ibiyitso -- collaborators -- who were to be shunned and, later, eliminated. In school, Tutsi children were made to sit in the back of the class and were otherwise made to realize that ""it was a sin to be a Tutsi."" At home, Tutsi parents sometimes were threatened. The odd rock would be hauled through windows and occasionally people were beaten.

But it always was just a touch less hateful in Butare, and even after full-bore genocide exploded on April 7, 1994, it took two full weeks, as well as personal intervention of the interim president, before the people of Butare succumbed to cold-blooded murder.

""We never thought of moving because we didn't imagine that level of violence,"" Mukabazanira says. ""We never thought it would get to genocide.""

On April 21, as a few soldiers fired in the air and the mobs began a house-to-house search, Mukabazanira and Murekezi grabbed their children and ran for the hills. All the Tutsi of Mpare and surrounding hills began to gather in public buildings in the area, as well as places of worship, thinking they'd be safe. But the bodies were piling up quickly, and Mukabazanira and Murekezi decided to send their children to their various Hutu godparents.

Mukarugagi took custody of Delphine. The little girl stayed alive for only the next two days, until April 23. None of the other children survived the massacre, and neither did their father.

Mukarugagi at first blames the whole thing on ""the militia.""

""We don't know who conspired to tell the militia that there were Tutsi children hiding in our home,"" she says. ""The militia grabbed the children from our house and killed them in front of my husband's grandfather's house."" The families all lived in close proximity: Mukarugagi's father-in-law lived two houses away, followed by her grandfather-in-law's, which was next door to hers. Mukabazanira and her family lived around the corner, their home visible just beyond the banana trees.

At length she admits that the culprit was family -- her brother-in-law, an interahamwe member she identifies as Sentama, who took Delphine away to be slaughtered. ""We thought he was going to protect her,"" she says, having also offered that at that very moment other Tutsi children were being hacked to death next door in her grandfather-in-law's compound.

Accusations and Arrests
""I let the child go because we wanted to save her,"" she says repeatedly, as if, by repetition, somehow she can reassure herself that she did her very best.

On June 4, 1997, after an embittered Mukabazanira filed a complaint with local prosecutors, Mukarugagi was arrested and has been held ever since in Butare prison. Mukabazanira has similarly lodged charges of murder against other former friends, targeting the godparents with particular zeal.

""We thought no one could kill their godchildren, but they were the ones who did the killings,"" she says. One of them, Cleophas Rugizama, was sentenced to 20 years for the killing of Jocelyn Iribagiza, the oldest of the five children who was 15. The godmother of Aline Umujanyagwa, 14, the second born, was out of Mukabazanira's reach. The woman, Goreti Mukabuyenje, died in the refugee camps in Congo, where much of the Hutu population fled after the Rwandan Patriotic Front defeated the old regime.

For the past seven years of prison life, Mukarugagi misses most her own three children, who are being raised by their grandmother, though they visit occasionally. She says she has been isolated by her husband's family. ""The killers are from my husband's family, but they are putting everything on my head,"" she says. ""Even my husband's family is trying to blame me.""

The only time Mukarugagi has met her old friend was during an investigative hearing four years ago in the prosecutor's office. She says she never had the chance to offer an apology or any expression of regret. ""She never greeted me that day,"" Mukarugagi says, and being a prisoner, she was not permitted, she says, to speak unless spoken to.

Mukabazanira's anger is not limited to her close friends. Some of the other killers that she barely knew have been paroled and are back in the old neighborhood. Sometimes, just to eyeball them, Mukabazanira goes back up there from her new home in downtown Butare. She seems to relish the moment when, at her sight, they all scamper off into the brush.

A Turn of Luck
""I meet many of them around town, including one who had clubbed me on the shoulder. They are scared when they see me. One of them riding a motorcycle saw me and fell in front of my vehicle. I had to break hard to avoid running him over.""

Ten years ago, by a stroke of luck she cannot now conclude was either good or bad, Mukabazanira survived the genocide. Her husband and two of the children were cornered while hiding with hundreds of others in the local dispensary. She was separated from them in the confusion, and hid in the pine bush and abandoned hospital buildings. Until finally the Rwandan Patriotic Front overran Butare and she was saved.

One recent afternoon, wandering around the field of millet that was once the site of her home, Mukabazanira kicks at the small pile of rubble that represents the only sign that her family ever existed on this patch of land. ""They thought people like us who went to school were collaborators, so they not only killed us they destroyed our houses completely,"" she says. ""They wanted to wipe away any trace of our existence.""

In her sentimental moments, which admittedly are brief, Mukabazanira allows perhaps that if her former tormentors sincerely apologized, ""then we will surely forgive them."" Then she quickly catches herself.

""As for me, there is no reconciliation,"" she says finally. ""What we have is tolerance, not reconciliation. We have no option; we cannot avoid them on the road.

""But it is too difficult to reconcile."""
118,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"Valerie Bemeriki would like the world to know that, all in all, she was only doing her duty.

Hers was one of the most recognized and most effective voices on the so-called Hate Radio, known by its French acronym RTML, which helped mobilize Rwanda's Hutu majority to genocide 10 years ago. That voice, by turns shrill, seductive and authoritative, goaded and encouraged the country's Hutu, sometimes helpfully suggesting the names and hiding places of members of the minority Tutsi and their Hutu sympathizers who had yet to be murdered.

To make it easier for her listeners to see their victims as less than human, she made up vulgar stories about the inyenzi, or cockroaches, as Tutsi were called. She even accused them of cannibalism.

""They mutilate the body and remove certain organs, such as the heart, liver and stomach; they eat human flesh, the inyenzi,"" she declared in one broadcast, transcripts of which are now in the possession of Rwandan authorities as well as the United Nations tribunal trying the ringleaders of the genocide.

Bemeriki, 48, sits today in the bleak, isolated prison here in southern Rwanda, five years after she was arrested in neighboring Congo. At the time of her arrest, in June 1999, the shocked and disoriented Bemeriki had pronounced herself guilty of incitement to genocide and begged forgiveness of her fellow citizens.

But now, facing the death penalty from Rwandan courts, Bemeriki is recanting. She contends that, at worst, listeners may have misunderstood her enthusiasm, a failing for which she cannot now be held responsible. ""I was only doing my job as a journalist,"" Bemeriki says. ""When we were working we never used our radio to say they should go and kill people. But the listeners may have misunderstood. If we asked people to get rid of cockroaches, we did not mean they should kill people.""

Which is clearly a lie, according to extensive transcripts of broadcasts during the genocide by RTML or Radio Television Libre Des Mille Collines. As the killings escalated, one announcer abandoned any pretense to figurative language, pleading: ""The graves are only half full. Who will help fill them?""

The radio station had been founded in 1993 by members of the family and inner circle of President Juvenal Habyarimana, who opposed the president's compromise treaty to end civil war by sharing power with the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front. Two of the station's founders have been convicted of genocide by the UN tribunal sitting in Arusha, Tanzania.

As a Category One offender -- those accused of spearheading the genocide -- Bemeriki knows she does not qualify for the mass release of suspects currently under way. The current Tutsi-led government, which assumed power after defeating the ""Hutu Power"" regime in July 1994, released 23,000 detainees last year. Many had been held without trial for nearly a decade, and the government was bowing to the reality that it had no capacity to try them in regular courts and, if it did, had no desire to jail or execute more than 100,000 people.

The fact that she does not qualify for amnesty makes it difficult for her to come clean, Bemeriki says. ""It is hindering any chance of my confessing.""

A short and powerfully built woman, Bemeriki once was an elegant Kigali socialite who was to be found in the company of the country's Hutu elite and at diplomatic functions. But her features now are coarse from five years on the run in the Congolese rain forest and another five in Rwanda's notoriously overcrowded prisons. She limps on one leg, from an automobile accident. Her standard issue prison dress is pink and low cut. She wears massive round glasses, and a string of beads adorns her neck.

Bemeriki was recruited by RTML in 1993 from the ruling party's propaganda department. Her witty and conversational style soon made her one of the country's most prominent voices. After the extremist faction seized power following Habyarimana's death in a plane crash on April 6, 1994, they quickly arranged to have the moderate prime minister murdered -- along with the 10 Belgian peacekeeping forces guarding her. In announcing the takeover, Bemeriki sneered that none of the moderates could be ""found,"" and then began to laugh uproariously.

She blames her superiors for any conduct that may somehow be construed as incitement to genocide. ""As you well know, a journalist is like a soldier: he tells the story his editor tells him,"" she says. ""We told the story as it was.""

Although she is listed in the government's top-100 list of genocide offenders, Bemeriki has no court date yet. The judicial system, which had to be built from scratch after 1994, has only now managed to complete a catalog of prisoners and the charges against them. Lawyers are in short supply. Most offenders will be tried under the Gacaca court system, a quasi-judicial tribunal being established at the village level where local notables will listen to confessions and sentence most to community service and compensation to survivors.

""Myself, I have no hope,"" Bemeriki says."
119,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"""In the village up there, there are a lot of killers,"" Domitira Mukabanza says. ""Come, I will show you."" With that, she sets off briskly across a sorghum field, up a footpath and toward the home of Johan Nturo.

Mukabanza lost her husband and five of her six children in a massacre at a monastery here 10 years ago. The youngest, 3-year-old Petronira Nzamukosha, was hacked to death right off her mother's back. The only surviving child is permanently crippled from machete blows. Mukabanza blames her neighbors, such as Nturo, who is accused of participating in the genocide.

It is early morning, and old man Nturo finds unexpected guests at his door. At 75 his sight is poor and his health is failing, which accounts for his recent parole after eight years in prison. Two of his sons remain behind bars.

""I am not guilty of anything,"" Nturo protests, despite the testimony of several survivors. ""My sons, too, are completely innocent. They are good Christians who feared the sin of killing.""

In part for this very denial, Mukabanza, 50, has far less faith than the government that Rwanda can be put back together again, that citizens can live together in peace, and that the genocide will not recur.

""It is very difficult to live in these circumstances, but we are poor and powerless,"" she says. ""To live with these people means that you don't know whether you will survive the night.""

It is a situation scarcely imaginable anywhere, as if most Jewish survivors were compelled to remain in Germany immediately after the Holocaust, living cheek by jowl with their erstwhile neighbors.

""Our first task is to reconstruct a nation -- to rebuild a people,"" says Tom Ndahiro, a member of the country's Human Rights Commission, one of the many official bodies charged with working with communities trying to stitch themselves back together. ""It is not easy.""

Slowly, a country that was left for dead in 1994 is staggering back to its feet. The current government inherited a nation where 70 percent of the population of 8 million either was displaced or dead. Almost all civic and governmental institutions, including schools and hospitals, had to be rebuilt from scratch. Though it still depends on foreign aid for much of its treasury, today Rwanda is experiencing a construction boom. Roads are being built, mobile telephones and Internet cafes are ubiquitous. New office towers and international hotels are going up in Kigali, the capital, which has gone from a necropolis to probably one of the safest cities in the world.

""You would have expected a failed state here, a Somalia of some sort,"" says Joseph Bidere, a Rwandan exile in Canada who moved back home after the genocide. ""I would not have thought the country would get to this point."" But physical recovery has not masked the continuing trauma of the genocide, the bitterness and suspicion that still to a large extent define life here.

By freeing tens of thousands of genocide suspects from prison, the government of President Paul Kagame is attempting a precarious balancing act between justice and reconciliation. Those who receive lenient treatment -- foot soldiers, not kingpins -- are required to confess their crimes and seek forgiveness from their victims. In time, officials say, people would re-establish ties that were rent by the genocide, and the country could slowly leave its bloody legacy behind.

Lending a hand in this project, in part to atone for its own catastrophic failure to protect the innocent, is the Roman Catholic Church, by far the most powerful institution in the country after the government. The church, like the government, is betting that it is still possible for lion and lamb to lie together in this mountain country, and has been encouraging ordinary people who participated in the genocide to ask forgiveness from survivors, and for survivors to grant it.

""Those who sinned against others and against God have to repent,"" says the head of Rwanda's Catholics, Archbishop Thaddée Ntihinyurwa, who touts a broad new effort by the church to re-engage its strayed flock. ""The church, after 2,000 years of preaching, now has started having a conversation with the people.""

Progress on the Surface
In public, a people notoriously obedient to authority -- the follow-the-leader culture in large part explains the willingness of millions to acquiesce in the genocide -- say the right things to conform to the official line. Many are loath now to talk about being Hutu or Tutsi, in accordance with official dictates. The government is hypersensitive to any flaunting of ethnic identity, and has thrown some leaders of the political opposition in jail ostensibly for engaging in a dangerous appeal to ethnic solidarity. So loud and frequent is the official condemnation of ""divisionism"" that many citizens make a show of minimizing ethnic identity as if it were already an ideology. According to one Kigali schoolteacher, who is Hutu, ""We are no longer Hutu or Tutsi; we're all Rwandans now.""

But in private, out of earshot in their living rooms or front yards, the level of bitterness people feel still has the capacity to shock, as in Tutsi survivors uniformly denouncing ""Hutu murderers,"" and known killers, even some who have confessed, effectively denying that a genocide occurred at all.

""You can imagine how difficult it is for a victim to live with the killer -- not just a genocide survivor but any victim at all,"" says Benoir Kaboyi, an official of the influential survivor group Ibuka, which means ""Remember"" in the Kinyarwanda language. ""How can you live with the person who has killed your children and your parents? When you have been raped and your property destroyed?

""Some survivors are trying to do their best, especially the young. But the elders?"" Here Kaboyi pauses, himself a survivor of the massacre inside the cathedral at Nyamata, south of the capital. A look of resignation crosses his face.

As in the rest of the country, the personal nature of the massacres in the district around Sovu, including at the nearby monastery of Benedictine nuns, makes the aftertaste especially bitter. This was not at all long-distance annihilation by precision-guided bombs. No gas chambers were used.

The killings, on the contrary, had a graphic, even pornographic quality. Killer and victim knew each other, either in the neighborhood or the workplace. Most of the deaths were close-contact: using a machete to hack a baby off the back of its fleeing mother, or a nail-studded club to smash a neighbor's skull. Often when the killers got tired at day's end, they would cripple victims by severing their Achilles' tendons, the easier to restart the ""work"" next morning.

Tension on the Footpath
Adelis Mukabutera survived the massacre on the grounds of the Sovu monastery. But now she lives in fear of the genocidaires recently returned home from prison, or from years on the run in the rain forests of neighboring Congo.

""There are killers all over the place,"" she says. ""They pass every day on that road you took here. We meet them in the market, in the hospital, and it is every day like that.""

Unselfconsciously, Mukabutera peels off her dress at the shoulders to reveal extensive scars from cutlass and gunshot wounds sustained on the monastery grounds a decade earlier, when she was only 18. Her father and six siblings died in the siege. One recent afternoon she ran into a man she recognized as one of the monastery killers, ""and there was not even a sign of guilt in his eyes.""

""Of course you feel terrible when you run into a murderer you know, and who knows you know them,"" Mukabutera says. ""It is very painful to see them walking around with impunity. They don't even look down. We are very bitter about this.

""All the time we are scared that they will come in the night to kill us.""

In Mukabutera's section of the district, a de facto segregation exists. The survivors live in an enclave of houses set along narrow dirt roads not far from the paved thoroughfare leading to the nearby town of Butare. Their former homes having been destroyed during the genocide, they moved into the new ones six years ago, through the generosity of a church group from neighboring Burundi.

The hills above them are inhabited almost exclusively by Hutu. Both communities cross paths unavoidably in the market, at the local dispensary, and on footpaths. Some are even friends.

Sorry to Have Survived
Marie-Chantal Mukamisha lives alone with her life's sorrows, except for the kindness of Anastasie Akayesu, a Hutu neighbor who sometimes drops by to keep her company, and occasionally to run errands. Akayesu's husband is being held in the local prison for crimes of genocide committed against the innocent, such as Mukamisha's family. The two women hardly ever discuss the genocide, Mukamisha says, but simply help each other cope with the hand that fate had dealt them.

She also is supported from time to time by another Hutu neighbor, a man who, noticing the 32-year-old woman's desperation, gave her one of his cows to help her get started. And during the genocide, after she had escaped by climbing from underneath a pile of bodies, Mukamisha had been saved by a Hutu woman who lived alone in a hut in the woods, and who had nursed her until her dreadful wounds healed. The woman, whose name she cannot now remember, took her in until the genocidal fever receded. ""She was a kind-hearted woman,"" she says.

But today she is no longer certain whether surviving the genocide was a good thing after all. With all seven brothers and both parents dead, and with her recent marriage effectively ended when her jobless husband walked away in December, Mukamisha admits to the torment of loneliness. And when she sees Hutu families, including the families of well-known killers, walking down the path, she admits to an acute sense of bitterness and helpless rage.

""Of course I feel very angry, but I don't have the strength to lash out,"" she says. ""You think of these people who have left you destitute and without a family and you want to lash out, but I just don't have the strength."" She disputes even her classification as a survivor, for how do you really survive a genocide? At the age of 32, Mukamisha sees a life of desolation stretching into the horizon, at the end of which comes death. ""I think I should have died, because I don't see any way to deal with this loneliness,"" she says. ""I just spend the days in no particular pattern. I don't see any hope. All I can see is survival until I die.""

The Neighbor's House
Domitira Mukabanza is a little agitated, which accounts for her volunteering to point out a neighbor's house as the redoubt of unrepentant killers. She reels off names of accused genocidaires who have returned home from prison. Even more will return in coming weeks, as the government sends home another batch of up to 30,000 detainees, especially those who have confessed and were not adjudged to be principal organizers of the genocide. Mukabanza says she understands some of those who killed her children, and who left her for dead in a mass grave, would be among them.

""I was in the grave, and it began raining heavily,"" she recalls now, shivering involuntarily. ""It was a shallow grave. The rain washed away the soil. The wild dogs that were eating the dead bodies came. Luckily the rain had softened the soil, and I was able to get out.""

Stumbling around in the woods, bleeding from multiple wounds, she eventually made her way to her mother's family, who were Hutu, though being half-Hutu had not saved her from the mob. Her mother's people took her in for a while, eventually hiding her elsewhere to avoid exposing themselves to denunciation as collaborators, an offense that in 1994 was punishable by death.

But now the killers walk free, Mukabanza says, hissing in disgust that such a situation could have been allowed to develop. ""When I go till my garden plot, I know only God is protecting me,"" she says. ""I can be killed at any time.""

Johan Nturo has a completely opposite view of things. Following his arrest in February 1995 for participation in the genocide, he had been held without charge until his conditional release last year, pending final determination of his status by a village tribunal that is expected to begin sitting here this month.

That two of his four sons remain behind in prison, to Nturo, is an outrage. He concedes nothing to the survivors. ""Those who claimed that I killed have an ulterior motive,"" he says, with heat. ""They claimed that I killed Alexandre [a local man] but it is only because they wanted me in jail so that, perhaps, they could take my cattle."" Nturo is seated in his barebones living room. Behind him is a large wooden Jesus on the cross, and this religious symbol dominates the room. Nturo is quite agitated, frowning and gesticulating. His pants are patched; his skin dark and cracking.

During the ""problems,"" he says, he never went anywhere -- never even left his compound. His sons merely cut grass for the cattle even as other men, young and old, took up arms and cleansed the hillside of Tutsi. In the end, he says, the government of the day was to blame for encouraging people to kill. ""If the government decides that something is going to happen, I cannot do anything about it,"" he says. ""I don't know what goes on in the minds of leaders that they would tell people to do something like that.""

He softens a bit. ""You can see that I am an old man. I wish I could have done something to help,"" he says. ""I can tell you it was a very unfortunate event. Maybe it was a curse, the kind that brings famine and pestilence."" Still, Nturo misses his sons, Stefan Sibimana and Gasper Gasasira, and wishes they were home to help care for the cattle and fend for the family. ""I am an old man now,"" he says repeatedly, ""and my days cannot be many. I am no longer strong. I have a bad knee. I am not in good health. I don't have very long.""

He insists on his sons' innocence while obliquely conceding at least moral cowardice in not raising a finger in defense of his Tutsi neighbors. He appears to be suggesting, in his roundabout way, that he should not be judged too harshly, for who in all truth can be certain of his reaction when called upon to risk his own life in order to save another?

But denying the genocide, not calling it by name, and treating it as a phenomenon for which an abstract ""government"" is guilty but not individuals, remains a matter of great frustration for Ndahiro, of the Human Rights Commission. He calls it ""the killing of memory.""

""The genocide was conducted in plain sight,"" he says. ""When you start justifying or denying a crime of such enormity, you're killing memory. You're also telling the survivors that they should not rest in peace.""

Survival Is Paramount
But survivors are not foremost on Vincente Mutabazinga's mind -- survival is. Now 27, Mutabazinga was a hot-headed teenage member of the interahamwe militia that did most of the killing 10 years ago. After seven years in detention he was provisionally released last May, along with some 23,000 other genocide suspects.

But he has returned home to joblessness, his family's grinding poverty, and the ostracism of some of the neighbors.

Mutabazinga remains the very picture of the militia member, who favors a bandana, T-shirt and jeans. His eyes are bloodshot and, if possible, he may be even more hardened now than he was at 17. Locals still call him Gasiyete, his nickname from interahamwe days. His very carriage invokes dread.

""Some pretend they don't see me and cross to the other side of the road,"" he says. ""Sometimes you think that killing yourself is the best way to end this terrible life.""

Mutabazinga considers himself stuck in the hills, in his family compound that can only be charitably described as modest. Theirs is the face of poverty at its most elemental, and Mutabazinga's father, for one, couldn't care less about the genocide or the suffering of the survivors.

""I felt very bad about my son because he used to work down there in a shop with a Tutsi,"" says Gasper Rurinda, who is 60 going on 90, so abject is his physical condition. ""When the killings were over some people decided that my son was a killer, for no good reason. So how can I feel anything but ill will towards those who have wrongly accused him?

""Even the survivors you are talking about, how can you be sure they are telling the truth? How can you be sure they are not trying to take somebody's cow? Just because they won the war?""

The father's denials are unequivocal, but not the son's. Mutabazinga says only that when he eventually appears before an open-air village court, known as Gacaca, ""I will stand and say that I can't understand what made young men do that. I was young at the time. I was 17 years old.""

For now, reconciliation between survivor and accused appears far away.

""The survivor and the detainees' families, to me there is no communication. There is no social dialogue in the hills,"" says Florien Ukizemwabo, a human rights activist. ""Perhaps after the process of justice is finished, for the survivors and the detainees, we can have a proper dialogue about why the genocide was committed by Hutu against Tutsi.""

Even Hutu who were known to have opposed the genocide, such as Ukizemwabo, often resent that they are made to feel the enormous weight of a crime committed in their name.

""I am not for this generalization of crime, of group guilt, because it really frustrates people,"" says Ukizemwabo, who runs the Rwandan League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. ""If we generalize, the feelings will also be generalized and this attitude is not helpful in building the society.""

A thoughtful, soft-spoken man, Ukizemwabo says many Hutu feel frustration and an acute sense of isolation -- estrangement, even -- from their country.

A Growing Optimism
""Somebody who sees himself as a Hutu will say there is no hope for the future because the government is led by Tutsi,"" he says. ""A Hutu in that sense does not see his place. He feels out of place because we haven't addressed the question of ethnicity. He feels a Hutu must be someone who lives in a Rwanda led by Hutu. Majority of Hutu feel this way. People feel things are Tutsi dominated.""

""Minimizing ethnicity is a good thing to stabilize the country, especially after the genocide,"" Ukizemwabo, who ignores the relevance of being Hutu to the subject at hand, says carefully. ""On the other hand, it is not healthy in the longer term to not talk about ethnic groups, since the genocide was conducted on an ethnic basis. You must prepare the society to talk honestly about ethnicity.""

Although he speaks in the third person, Ukizemwabo, 40, may have been talking about none other than himself. A Hutu who opposed the genocide and lived to tell the tale, he has an abiding optimism about his country's prospects, despite the staggering problems it confronts.

""Overall we are going in the right direction,"" he says. ""At the very minimum, we have a government that does not preach hate.""

That optimism is not uncommon among Rwandans. Their government is heavy handed in dealing with dissent, but few Rwandans question the near miracle of its achievements, notably the revival of a literally dead nation.

""We Rwandans have a saying,"" says Manzi Kayihura, a former exile in Germany who returned home to help rebuild. ""'By day God attends to the needs of his unruly children worldwide, but at night he comes home to Rwanda to sleep.'""

Kayihura is getting married in August and plans to raise a family in Kigali. In post-genocide Rwanda, that itself is an act of faith."
120,Newsday,Dele Olojode,2005,Rwanda Genocide,"In another era, say only a decade or so earlier, Alice Nikuze and Eugene Shyaka would have made an utterly unremarkable couple.

But this was the end of 1997, and they were proposing to their families that they get married, which most certainly proved they were fools in love.

Rare is the Tutsi who marries a Hutu these days, as a union across the lines has become a social and psychological obstacle in a country struggling to recover from its apocalypse. The wounds still fester from the genocide of 1994.

The betrayal that the genocide represented was deep and all-encompassing, to the point where husband killed wife. And so, only three years after the country's decimation, the announcement from Nikuze, -- she is Hutu -- and Shyaka -- he is Tutsi -- of their plans for marriage was not exactly well received. Some relatives were indignant -- his more than hers. Friends were almost uniformly appalled, some of them attributing the announcement to temporary insanity and threatening to put a stop to such foolishness.

""My uncle asked me, 'In this entire district, can't you find someone else?' says Shyaka, 42. ""He did not raise ethnicity directly, only in a roundabout way. But everyone understood what he meant.""

Like millions of other Hutu who feared Tutsi reprisals after the defeat of the genocidal regime, most members of Nikuze's extended family had fled to the Congo, and only her immediate family and a few uncles and aunts were around for the announcement. This helped reduce the strength of the opposition which, she says, did not include her parents.

""My immediate family had no problems with it at all,"" Nikuze, 32, says. ""If they'd expressed any reservations -- I respect my mother very much -- then I wouldn't have gone ahead with it. But some older relatives, their minds were closed against it. When you asked for a reason, they offered none by way of explanation.""

In volume and intensity, the objections raised by Shyaka's friends and family were more significant. His mother was silent, offering neither support nor opposition. But it was his father, who had fled Rwanda with his family after the first anti-Tutsi pogrom of 1959, who eventually saved the day.

""Luckily I have a very understanding father who is very open-minded,"" says Shyaka, who grew up a refugee in neighboring Uganda. ""He said if there was genuine love between us, he saw no reason to stop it.""

Throughout Rwanda's history, intermarriage was common between Hutu and Tutsi, so that today it often is difficult to tell one group from another. Typically the Tutsi are characterized by more than average height, slender build and aquiline features common to groups sprinkled throughout East and West Africa. The Hutu tend to be shorter and broad-featured, also typical of groups throughout Africa. The commingling over time produced a substantial number of Rwandans who could ""pass"" either way, and errors in classification led to many unintended killings -- and lucky escapes -- during the genocide.

The suspicion that forms a by-product of the genocide has made intermarriages today extremely rare. Even the brave few who have scaled the social barrier are loath to draw attention to themselves, particularly in an environment where trumpeting one's ethnic identity is seen as an assault on the country's very existence. The government's mantra, in reaction to the genocide, is: Everyone's a Rwandan, neither Hutu nor Tutsi.

But group identity cannot be so easily wished away by official proclamation. ""Government says you must be Rwandan first, after which you can be anything else,"" says Florien Ukizemwabo of the Rwandan League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. ""But this is not in everyone's hearts.""

A shopkeeper in this town at the foot of the Virunga range, home of mountain gorillas, Nikuze met her future husband in 1997 at the provisions store she runs. He kept coming back, and it soon became clear that he was hanging around not just so he could buy canned milk.

Negotiations with family and friends led to moments of indecision.

""Sometimes I thought I might be making a big mistake,"" Shyaka readily admits. ""And when my uncle objected, it also created doubts in me.""

As for Nikuze, she was more afraid than reticent -- scared of potential attack by Hutu extremists who were still launching cross-border raids at the time, and who might regard her as consorting with the enemy. This was not mere paranoia: while attending high school in the early 1990s, her name appeared on a school list of collaborators simply, she says, because she had lots of Tutsi friends.

But all anxiety and fear eventually gave way by the wedding date, Jan. 17, 1998, and friends and family, including most of the objectors, were in attendance. The birth shortly thereafter of Mariella Uwicyeza, the first of their three children, won over any holdouts. Such occasions are a time of great feasting and gift giving in Rwanda, and old animosities and resentments tend to be set aside.

The children, finally, are the only hope of this damaged country, Nikuze says.

""I have hope that our children will live in harmony with other children, that they will be brought up in ways that children before them were not,"" she says. ""In the past the children were taught in school to hate. That is no longer the case."""
121,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice,"For three days and three nights, the police wrenched Qin Yanhong's arms high above his back, jammed his knees into a sharp metal frame, and kicked his gut whenever he fell asleep. The pain was so intense that he watched sweat pour off his face and form puddles on the floor.

On the fourth day, he broke down. ""What color were her pants?"" they demanded. ""Black,"" he gasped, and felt a whack on the back of his head. ""Red,"" he cried, and got another punch. ""Blue,"" he ventured. The beating stopped.

This is how Mr. Qin, a 35-year-old steel mill worker in Henan Province in central China, recalled groping in the darkness of a interrogation room to deduce the ""correct"" details of a rape and murder, end his torture and give the police the confession they required to close a nettlesome case.

On the strength of his coerced confession alone, prosecutors indicted Mr. Qin. A panel of judges then convicted him and sentenced him to death. He is alive today only because of a rare twist of fate that proved his innocence and forced the authorities to let him go, though not before a final push to have him executed anyway.

Justice in China is swift but not sure. Criminal investigations nearly always end in guilty pleas. Prosecutors almost never lose cases brought to trial. But recent disclosures of wrongful convictions like Mr. Qin's have exposed deep flaws in a judicial system that often answers more to political leaders than the law.

""Our public security system is the product of a dictatorship,"" Mr. Qin wrote his family when he was on death row. ""Police use dictatorial measures on anyone who resists them. Ordinary people have no way to defend themselves.""

The viability of China's Communist Party depends more than ever on its ability to create a credible legal system. The party needs the law to check corruption, which has eroded its legitimacy. The authorities want people to turn to the courts, rather than take to the streets, to resolve social discontents that have made the country more volatile than at any time since the 1989 democracy movement.

The law, in other words, has become a front line in China's struggle to modernize under one-party rule. Yet Mr. Qin's persecution and similar miscarriages of justice that have come to light this year suggest that China is struggling with a fundamental question of jurisprudence: Do officials serve the law, or do laws serve the officials? Or, to put it another way, is the Communist Party creating rule of law or rule by law?

Twenty-seven years after Deng Xiaoping declared at the outset of China's economic reforms, that ""the country must rely on law,"" the Communist Party realizes that it cannot effectively govern a thriving market-oriented economy unless people trust in law. Hundreds of thousands of new lawyers, stronger courts and a blizzard of Western-inspired codes protect property, enforce contracts and limit police powers.

Disgruntled peasants, displaced urban homeowners and newly wealthy entrepreneurs demand that the authorities respect constitutional rights long treated as notional. Even inside the system, some policemen, prosecutors and judges have tried making the law into a more independent force.

But the transition has been arduous, and the outcome remains uncertain. Beijing draws the line at legal challenges to senior officials or important government agencies. The courts rarely if ever rule in favor of political protesters. Even in business cases, political influence often proves decisive.

Criminal law poses one of the biggest challenges -- and most pointed sources of discontent. The police and courts still rely mainly on pretrial confessions and perfunctory court proceedings to resolve criminal cases instead of the Western tradition of analyzing forensic evidence and determining guilt through contentious court trials.

China's criminal laws forbid torture and require judges to weigh evidence beyond a suspect's confession. But lawyers and legal scholars say forced confessions remain endemic in a judicial system that faces pressure to maintain ""social stability"" at all costs.

The police and government officials in Anyang, the northern Henan county seat where Mr. Qin was interrogated, and authorities in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, declined repeated written requests to discuss his case.

But Mr. Qin, his family members and several people involved in his defense said the case showed how political motives and collusion among police, prosecutors and the courts could make the law a source of terror for people who lack the power or money to defend themselves.

A Suspect Investigation
Just after noon on Aug. 3, 1998, Jia Hairong, a 30-year-old peasant woman, was found murdered on her family's farm in the village of Donggaoping, an hour's drive from Anyang, according to court documents. Her pants had been cut off with a razor blade. She was raped and strangled, her body stashed behind tall cornstalks.

The police found a plastic alarm clock and the razor blade at the scene. They determined that both items were stolen from a nearby home just before the assault.

Court documents do not make clear whether physical evidence -- fingerprints, blood, semen, traces of clothing -- could have identified the killer. If there were such forensic leads, they were not followed.

Instead, the police relied on the accounts of three children who were playing outdoors in Qinxiaotun, a village about a mile east of Donggaoping, the records show. The children recalled seeing Mr. Qin, who lives in Qinxiaotun, walking from the direction of Donggaoping that afternoon.

Around midnight on Aug. 4, four officers arrived at the steel plant where Mr. Qin worked nights and took him away for questioning.

Mr. Qin is a tall, shy, doe-eyed man who rarely travels farther than a bicycle ride from his dirt-floored village home. When he speaks -- friends say he generally speaks only when spoken to -- he has a heavy local accent that even Anyang residents have trouble understanding.

The police would not tell him why he was being detained. But through the early morning hours, he was told to detail how he spent Aug. 1 to 3, and especially the afternoon of Aug. 3. He said he had stayed at home that day before going to work at night.

After the police said a witness told them that he walked through the village that afternoon he amended his story, recalling that he visited the family farm, a short distance from home, to fertilize the fields.

""The farmland is close, so it is not like leaving home,"" Mr. Qin said later. ""But they thought they had caught me lying.""

He was handcuffed and shackled. He still had no idea what he was suspected of doing. But he overheard some officers and drivers discussing a local murder. He wondered if his detention had some connection.

""I kept asking them what this was all about,"" Mr. Qin said. ""No one would tell me.""

A senior detective named Shen Jun took charge of his interrogation, court documents show. Mr. Qin described Mr. Shen's approach as polite, even conciliatory at first. The detective said he was investigating the theft of an alarm clock. He said Mr. Qin's fingerprints matched those found on the clock.

""He said it was a cheap little alarm clock and that there was no reason to lie,"" Mr. Qin said. ""I should just confess. ""Then everyone could go home.""

Mr. Qin said he hoped his detention really was prompted by a petty theft. But instinct told him not to admit stealing something he did not steal. So the pressure intensified.

Mr. Shen organized four teams of two policemen each. The teams interrogated Mr. Qin in consecutive six-hour shifts, day and night, for three days.

The questioning quickly turned to torture. Mr. Qin said he was made to sit for many hours on the open metal frame of a chair without a back. His feet and arms were strapped to the chair legs and his body slumped through the frame, forcing the backs of his knees and his lower back against the sharp edges. The technique is known as ""tiger stool.""

Alternately, Mr. Qin's hands were handcuffed behind his back and cinched up until they were above his head and his arms felt as though they would separate from his shoulders. This was referred to as ""taking a jet plane.""

He described the pain as piercing. But he said he suffered even greater agony from lack of sleep. The police poured frigid water on his head and pounded him awake when he nodded off. They referred to this as ""circling the pig."" By his third day in detention, he said, he felt delirious.

""It would take a superman to resist,"" he recalled.

Finally, pressed to specify the color of the stolen alarm clock, he made a guess: ""White."" An officer whacked his head and asked again, ""What color was the clock?"" ""Red,"" he offered, but he got another blow. Then he said, ""Green."" The beating stopped.

Soon thereafter, Mr. Shen told Mr. Qin his theft of the alarm clock proved he had killed Ms. Jia. The police now had all the evidence they needed, he said, but Mr. Qin must cooperate fully to avoid the harshest punishment. That meant he must volunteer every detail of the crime, three times over, and confess a complete narrative.

Still dazed, Mr. Qin hazarded guesses to every question -- was she wearing shorts or long pants? did he strangle her with his hands or with a rope? -- until he was allowed to sleep.

In the eight months between his arrest and his trial, Mr. Qin wrote a series of anguished letters home, urging his family to disregard the charges.

""Every word of the confession is a joke,"" he wrote in one letter to his older brother in early 1999. ""To this day, I have no idea what the victim looks like, and I certainly didn't know the color of her pants.""

Unwavering Conviction
In prison, Mr. Qin tutored himself in criminal law. His letters cited passages that he felt would aid his defense. Article 38 of the Chinese Constitution forbids extracting confessions by torture and ""frame-ups."" Article 46 of the 1996 revised Criminal Procedure Law declares that ""oral confessions"" are not sufficient grounds for conviction. Article 12 mandates that suspects must be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

His anger convinced his older brother, Qin Yanqing, who became his tireless champion. The elder Mr. Qin petitioned legal officials in Anyang and Zhengzhou to review the case. He exhausted the family savings on travel and lawyer fees.

He even sought out Mr. Shen. But the detective expressed unwavering conviction.

""I stake my 20 years of leadership experience as a guarantee,"" the elder Mr. Qin quoted Mr. Shen as telling him. ""If your brother did not commit this crime, then I will accept punishment.""

When the trial opened in April 1999, 50 relatives and villagers went to Anyang to testify on Mr. Qin's behalf. But the three-judge panel ordered the trial closed and excluded them from the courtroom, villagers said.

The prosecution brought no witnesses, and Mr. Qin said the judges prevented him from calling any. Mr. Qin vigorously recanted his confession. His lawyer argued that the prosecution's case, which depended wholly on the confession, was invalid. The trial was over before lunch.

Six months later, a judge visited Mr. Qin in prison and delivered the verdict: Mr. Qin was guilty of rape and murder, and would be executed. Mr. Qin had a right to appeal.

On death row, his cell contained 15 people and one toilet. He said that in his two years there, a dozen cellmates were escorted away in the early morning hours and executed with a bullet to the back of the head.

He was spared that fate not by his appeals, or by new DNA evidence, but by a stroke of luck that might count as a miracle.

One day in January 2001, a retired soldier named Yuan Qiufu walked into a police station in Linzhou, a town not far from Anyang, and told the officer on duty that he had raped, robbed and strangled 18 women. He provided voluminous details of his killing rampage that included an unerring account of the rape and murder of Ms. Jia and the theft of a green alarm clock.

Reversal of Fortune
Even in the world's most populous country, such definitive exonerations are not common. But this year alone about a dozen similar reversals of fortune have come to light, suggesting that legal officials and the state media are paying more attention to problems in the judicial system -- and that such problems run deep.

For example, last May, She Xianglin, a 39-year-old former security guard in Hubei Province, was released from jail after serving 11 years when his wife, whom he was convicted of murdering, returned for a visit. In 1994, she had run away and remarried in another province. The police decided that a body they found must be the wife's and that Mr. She must have killed her.

In June, a 30-year-old laborer in Shanxi Province was released from custody after a boy he confessed to killing and dumping into the Yellow River last year came back home. The boy had migrated to a city to find work.

In July, three police officers in Yunnan Province were convicted of torturing a man into saying he killed a prostitute. The man had been scheduled to go to trial for murder in 2002 when someone else admitted committing the crime.

Official statistics show such abuses are numerous. The Supreme People's Procuratorate, China's Justice Department, said in July that 4,645 criminal suspects had suffered human rights violations, including torture during inquisitions, in the previous 12 months.

Top officials are pushing to improve criminal procedures. Some legal scholars say one measure under consideration could give suspects the right to have a lawyer present during interrogations.

But such changes, if they come, will take time. China's Communist Party-run legislature has been urged to consider many new protections, like a right to remain silent. But such proposals have gone nowhere because the police steadfastly oppose them.

The last time the government overhauled criminal law procedures, in 1996, it toughened an existing ban on forced confessions, while declaring that suspects were entitled to a presumption of innocence. The current publicity campaign effectively acknowledges that the 1996 rules did not have the desired effect.

One obstacle is China's long history, in which criminal law was viewed as an extension of the power of the emperor rather than an objective code that applies to everyone. Confession amounted to a submission to authority, while a plea of innocence was viewed as a form of rebellion.

The legal code of the Tang Dynasty, for example, specified that guilt could only be finally assigned through confession, and that cases could not be officially recorded without a confession.

Li Bin, a defense lawyer and former government prosecutor in Yunnan, who was involved in the trial of the three policemen on charges of forcing a confession, said the problem was systemic.

In China's top-down political system, the police, prosecutors and judges respond mostly to incentives from above, Mr. Li said. They pay a much higher price for failing to maintain the appearance of social order than for torturing suspects, he said.

""The judicial system is set up to protect the authority of the government,"" he said. ""It is not set up to protect the rights of suspects.""

'No Hard Feelings'
The disclosure that Mr. Yuan, the serial killer, had murdered Ms. Jia set off alarm bells among Anyang officials. But the concern was the possibility that the wrongful arrest, prosecution and conviction of Mr. Qin could damage careers, Mr. Qin's family members and an investigator in the case who is based in Beijing said.

The officials' response was to suppress the new information -- and keep Mr. Qin on death row.

The investigator talked to the local officials involved, but asked to remain anonymous because of restrictions on speaking with reporters. He said that the authorities in Linzhou, who were handing the case of Mr. Yuan, and those in Anyang, responsible for Mr. Qin's incarceration, agreed between themselves to keep the crucial part of Mr. Yuan's confession secret. Mr. Yuan would be prosecuted for 17 murders instead of 18, leaving Mr. Qin's conviction intact.

""Their attitude was that if my brother was released, 20 officials would suffer,"" said Qin Yanqing, Mr. Qin's elder brother. ""But if he was executed, only one person would suffer.""

The agreement held for more than a year. It came to light only after an official in Linzhou joked about the matter to a reporter for a national legal affairs publication. Although the reporter did not publish an article on the subject, he did alert authorities in the capital, who ordered an inquiry.

In May 2002, a provincial-level legal investigation determined that Mr. Qin should be released. He was given a suite at a hotel. The Anyang County police organized a banquet.

""When I got back to my room, I cried and cried,"" he said. ""I could not control myself.""

A few days after his release, Mr. Qin went to the county police station and demanded to see Mr. Shen. The detective rushed out of a meeting to greet him, shaking his hand and apologizing profusely, Mr. Qin recalled.

""He said my case had been a severe lesson for them all,"" he said.

But whether they treated it that way is unclear. It took Mr. Qin and his brother several months to negotiate compensation. Local authorities eventually agreed to the equivalent of $35,000 in damages for four years of incarceration on false charges.

But the payment came with strict conditions. Mr. Qin had to agree not to talk about the matter with the news media or to petition higher authorities for more money.

He initially accepted those terms. But he broke the pledge this year, he said, because the authorities had refused to fully exonerate him. Although he has a notice from the police confirming that he was arrested in error, the notice attributes the arrest to a ""work mistake."" Mr. Qin has never been declared innocent of murder.

""They hope they can just make this disappear with no hard feelings and no problems for anyone involved,"" he said.

The last time Mr. Qin visited the police to press for a full restitution, he discovered that Mr. Shen had been promoted. He is no longer a detective team leader, but Anyang County's deputy chief of police."
122,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice,"David Ji, a Chinese-American electronics entrepreneur, spent two months in custody enduring all-night interrogation sessions, but his stubbornness and occasional flashes of sarcasm infuriated his Chinese captors.

So in late December last year, according to a person who compiled a record of the encounter, guards emptied his pockets, removed his shoes and socks, and ripped the buttons off his oxford shirt. He was ushered disheveled and barefoot into the office of Zhao Yong, the chief executive of Sichuan Changhong Electric, Mr. Ji's onetime business partner and, more recently, his warden.

""Your only way out is to do what Changhong tells you to do,"" Mr. Zhao told him. ""If I decide today I want you to die, you will be dead tomorrow.""

Mr. Ji soon agreed to cooperate with Changhong. But a year after the Chinese police apprehended him in his hotel room during a business trip, he remains in China as a pawn -- Mr. Ji's colleagues say a hostage -- in a commercial dispute that pits Changhong, China's largest television manufacturer, against Apex Digital, Mr. Ji's electronics trading company based in Los Angeles.

Changhong, which declined repeated requests for comment over several weeks, claims that Apex owes it $470 million. Apex, which recruited Changhong to supply Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Circuit City with inexpensive television sets and DVD players, says it owes less than $150 million. The sums involved are large, but what is more significant about the case is the way Changhong, a major state-owned company in Sichuan Province, deployed the police, prosecutors and judges in a campaign to collect its debt.

China has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and has become the world's third largest trading power. But its legal system, even when handling nonpolitical business cases, has progressed far more haltingly and still rarely backs investors or ordinary citizens against the state.

Difficulty enforcing contracts, rampant violations of copyrights and trademarks and protection of domestic industry champions have heightened trade tensions at a time when China is struggling to convince the outside world that its growing economic might poses no threat. Beijing is under heavy pressure to embrace global legal norms with the same fervor with which it has pursued foreign trade.

Courts and arbitration panels do resolve many business conflicts that arise from China's thriving market-oriented economy, and they can rule professionally and impartially. But when the fate of powerful companies like Changhong, which has 36,000 employees, lies in the balance, the judicial system does not act independently and offers no recourse for outsiders like Mr. Ji.

Ultimately, some legal scholars argue, China's legal system may not improve markedly until central and local government officials relinquish some control and stop putting short-term political goals, like protecting influential companies and suppressing dissent, above the law.

Mr. Ji and his Los Angeles-based partner, Ancle Hsu, are ethnic Chinese who became American citizens. They helped Changhong break into the American market, and its products outsold Sony and Panasonic, heralding China's arrival as an electronics powerhouse.

Relations with Changhong soured, however, over quality control problems and unpaid debts. And when they did, Changhong's first response was not to file a lawsuit, but to dispatch the police.

The police from Mianyang, the city in southwestern Sichuan province where Changhong has its headquarters, apprehended Mr. Ji in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, on Oct. 23, 2004. He entered a legal netherworld in which Changhong decided where he would be held in custody, when to interrogate him, and how he could help Changhong take over Apex, according to court documents, video recordings, and taped witness accounts compiled by people sympathetic to Mr. Ji. The records, which were also submitted to the State Department, were obtained independently by The New York Times.

Mianyang is a company town. The legal ambiguity partly reflects the tight bond between local corporate and government officials. It also reflects a risk of doing business in China that applies mainly to ethnic Chinese, dozens of whom have faced criminal charges after falling out with government-backed business partners. Overseas Chinese are often treated as subject to local authority regardless of their country of citizenship.

But in this case, Changhong did not act like a rogue. It solicited and received financial and political support from the most senior levels of the central government, according to lawyers involved in the matter.

Changhong's executives said they could not discuss a pending legal matter. But Jack C. Auspitz, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster in New York who represents Changhong in an ongoing court case against Apex, said the California company repeatedly failed to pay for goods Changhong delivered. He said that he did not have detailed information about Mr. Ji's conditions in Chinese custody, but that he had no reason to believe that he had been coerced.

The Chinese police accused Mr. Ji of fraud for writing bad checks to Changhong and have threatened to prosecute him. He has been released on a form of bail, with heavy restrictions on his freedom, while negotiations with Apex proceed. That has left the impression that his legal fate depends on debt talks between the companies.

""We have been doing business there for many years but could never imagine something like this happening,"" said Mr. Hsu, Mr. Ji's partner, in a recent interview. ""They have turned a commercial dispute into a hostage situation and a human rights issue.""

Trial and Error
Changhong and Apex seemed, for a time, a brilliant match.

The American company spotted the potential of the DVD player to replace the VCR in American living rooms if the price came down. Japanese makers dominated sales in the late 1990's, but often charged $400 or more, making it a luxury item. Apex thought that with the right Chinese partner it could change that.

The job fell to Mr. Ji, 53, who is also known by his Chinese name, Ji Longfen. He was born in Jiangsu Province in eastern China and learned English at Fudan University in Shanghai before emigrating to California. There he and Mr. Hsu, a native of Taiwan, sold scrap metal and car radios before testing the DVD market.

Retiring by American standards, Mr. Ji projects a polite deference that plays well in China. He wears his hair in a starchy wave, a style popular among Chinese officials. He toured industrial zones and small township enterprises for partners, a trial-and-error process that produced some embarrassing failures. A worker in one plant altered a chip on an Apex DVD player to make a message appear on the screen if a user loaded an X-rated film: ""You dirty old man!""

Changhong, once a big defense contractor and now a publicly traded electronics maker, seemed more professional. The company, though majority owned by the Mianyang city and Sichuan provincial governments, had entrepreneurial drive. Under Ni Rongfen, its chief executive, Changhong became China's top television maker. It had its sights set on the American market.

Mr. Ji and Mr. Ni struck a deal in 2001. In the Chinese style, the agreement consisted of a simple three-page purchase order.

Changhong was not Apex's only vendor, but it rapidly became its largest. Its bulk production brought the retail price of its DVD players at Wal-Mart and Circuit City down to $59. In 2002, Apex became the top brand of DVD player in the United States.

Apex also began selling Changhong-made television sets and got the cost of a 27-inch color model below $100, a record. The company's total sales hit $1 billion in 2002 and nearly $2 billion in 2003.

But the two companies were on a collision course. Changhong received far less from its American sales than it initially recorded on its books. Fast growth covered that deficit for a time, but the Chinese company later claimed that half of what it sold ended up as unpaid debt.

The companies have different explanations of what happened. Apex says Changhong mismanaged its business, basing production on price forecasts that proved overly optimistic. It also did not time its shipments well, saddling Apex with high storage costs, the company says. Worse, the California company claims, Changhong provided low-quality goods, including a ill-fated foray into rear-projection televisions, which left Apex to deal with dissatisfied customers and defective products.

Changhong executives have told the Chinese news media that Apex played tricks with its vendors. It persuaded them to finance their own production and wait months for payment. Payments often lagged behind badly, raising suspicions of fraud.

Two other Chinese electronics makers, the Hongtu High Technology Company and the Tianjin Tiancai Company, say Apex owes them money. A third supplier, the China Minmetals Corporation, recently settled a dispute with Apex in arbitration.

Whatever the root causes of the dispute, Apex and Changhong initially tried to keep things on track, including by taking steps that came back to haunt Mr. Ji.

In early 2003, as debts piled up, Mr. Ni, the Changhong boss, came under pressure to explain the shortfall. He leaned on Mr. Ji, who wrote 37 company checks totaling $85 million. Apex said the checks, which do not bear the markings of having been deposited, were meant as promissory notes. It said it honored them and more by paying Changhong $370 million later in 2003.

Even so, Changhong's debt load worsened and its stock price plunged. Chinese state-run banks stopped advancing loans, Chinese news media reports said. That prompted a boardroom coup against Mr. Ni last summer. He was replaced by Zhao Yong, the deputy mayor of Mianyang.

Shortly after he took office, Mr. Zhao sent a mission to Apex's headquarters to demand payment of $470 million, a figure Apex claimed was three times what it owed. The business relationship froze.

Apex still had a sizable business in China. In October 2004, Mr. Ji visited to oversee progress on a Wal-Mart order for portable DVD players. He ignored warnings of a colleague at Apex, who felt the dispute with Changhong had reached a dangerous impasse, and decided to contact Changhong during the trip. He told his family he would be back in a week.

Mr. Ji phoned Changhong after he arrived and said he would like to meet Mr. Zhao after attending to business in Shenzhen. He hung up thinking that a dinner appointment had been arranged.

""I felt very happy because I thought the problem would finally be resolved by one person,"" Mr. Ji told a colleague.

Pursuit and Capture
Just after breakfast on Oct. 23, he answered his door at the Grand Skylight Hotel in Shenzhen. Seven men in civilian clothes identified themselves as police officers from Sichuan, 500 miles to the west. They interrogated Mr. Ji for most of the day. He was told he had committed fraud, though the charges were not spelled out and they had no warrant, according to the account compiled by people sympathetic with him.

Late that afternoon, Mr. Ji was taken to a private dining room, where a Changhong executive played host for a banquet, complete with champagne and abalone. The Changhong executive raised his glass to the policemen, congratulating them on their ""pursuit and apprehension"" of Mr. Ji.

Mr. Ji objected, saying he had never been on the run, according to the record of his detention. He was told not to speak for the rest of the meal.

The officers then took him to the airport for a flight to Sichuan. Changhong purchased all eight seats in the first-class section, so the group had the cabin to itself.

In Sichuan, he was handed over to Changhong. The company cordoned off a floor in one of its guesthouses and barred the windows, a makeshift jail. Guards kept watch. A television was left blaring day and night. For four days, Mr. Ji barely slept.

On the fifth day, he was put on the phone with a lawyer named Charlie Wang, known as Wang Xiaoling in Chinese, of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, a white-shoe American law firm that Changhong had retained. Mr. Wang, who was based in Washington, D.C., told Mr. Ji that he had committed fraud and that his only way out was to sign documents that would help Changhong recover missing funds. Exhausted and afraid, Mr. Ji agreed to study the documents, the record of his detention says.

He was then presented with a stack of legal papers the size of a mini-bar. They pledged all of Apex's assets, real property, trademarks and bank accounts as well as Mr. Ji's personal assets to settle the claimed $470 million debt. The documents granted Changhong power of attorney to review Apex's books and remove Mr. Hsu from his position. In effect, he signed away his stake of Apex to Changhong.

Mr. Ji initially balked. A guard then asked, ""Do you want this pen, or do you want your hand?"" The guard made a motion of chopping off his hand. Mr. Ji took the pen.

'Business as Usual'
Changhong then began an attempt to take over Apex, Apex officials and the record of Mr. Ji's detention say. Mr. Ji was sent to Shanghai by train.

There he stayed in a Changhong-owned residence under guard. But he was instructed to visit Apex offices and act as if he were going about business as usual. He made frequent phone calls back home. As his Changhong guards listened, he repeatedly told Mr. Hsu to execute Changhong's instructions.

The calls did not persuade Mr. Hsu.

""He pretended that nothing was wrong and everything would be worked out,"" Mr. Hsu recalled. ""But we knew he was not himself. Eventually, there was nothing we could say on the phone except, 'Yes David, O.K., yes.'""

Changhong dispatched accountants and investigators to Los Angeles in early December, but Apex refused access, arguing that Changhong lacked legal authority.

It was only then that Changhong took legal action. On Dec. 14, Changhong sued Apex in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The company alleged breach of contract and demanded access to Apex, citing the documents Mr. Ji had signed.

Apex contested the suit. In court documents, it said that Mr. Ji had been abducted and that the documents had been signed under coercion.

Changhong pressed Mr. Ji harder to make Mr. Hsu cooperate. Mr. Ji scoffed, saying he had already ""fired"" his partner on Changhong's orders so there was little more he could do, according to the record of his detention.

There were constant reminders, however, that his fate hung in the balance. A prosecutor and a judge from Mianyang visited Shanghai to talk with Mr. Ji. They told him that the 37 checks he had written to Changhong in early 2003 constituted a serious crime and that he could get life in prison or even be executed. His only choice was to cooperate with Changhong, the record said.

Changhong submitted the checks as evidence in its American lawsuit. There are no visible markings on the checks to show that they were deposited or sent through the banking system for payment. Apex says that proves Changhong treated the checks as they were intended -- as collateral to solve an accounting problem. They became obsolete when Apex made big payments to Changhong in April 2003, the company says.

Mr. Auspitz, Changhong's lawyer in New York, said that despite any other payments Apex may have made in 2003, those checks should have been honored. ""There is no question that Apex should have paid and did not,"" he said.

To counter Apex's argument that Mr. Ji was a hostage, Changhong arranged to have Mr. Ji deposed in Apex's Shanghai offices. Mr. Wang, the Cadwalader lawyer, was present and conducted the videotaped inquiry. Mr. Ji had no lawyer present, and Apex later argued that that raised questions of whether the tape would have any value in an American court.

When taping began, Mr. Ji disputed Changhong's version of events, prompting a heated argument between Mr. Ji and Mr. Wang, according to people who saw the confrontation.

The next day, Mr. Ji was taken to meet Mr. Zhao, Changhong's boss. Buttons and belt removed, he had to hold his pants up with his hands. Mr. Zhao warned him that Changhong controlled the courts in Mianyang, that Mr. Ji would be tried there, and that Changhong would decide if he lived or died.

""Apex must give Changhong all the money. This is your only way out,"" Mr. Ji was told, according to the record of his detention.

A second taped deposition was arranged. Mr. Ji dressed neatly in a suit. He sat slumped in his chair and smiled wanly. Everything Mr. Wang asked him, he muttered agreement. As the camera rolled, he said Changhong had ""invited"" him to stay at its apartment in Shanghai while he sorted out the dispute about the checks.

""I am trying to run my company,"" Mr. Ji says on tape. ""I am the majority shareholder and want to use my power to manage this situation.""

High-Level Intervention Changhong's lawsuit has remained unresolved in court in Los Angeles. The taped deposition was never formally submitted, though Apex received a copy. Apex then complained that Changhong's lawyer, Mr. Wang, acted improperly by being a party to the detention of Mr. Ji.

Cadwalader subsequently withdrew from the case and Mr. Wang, who was made a partner just a few months earlier, left the firm. A spokesman for Cadwalader declined to comment on the case or on Mr. Wang, citing client confidentiality. Apex's business deteriorated as suppliers and customers learned of its troubles. Its sales this year are off sharply, and it has teetered on the verge of bankruptcy. It now claims it has no money to pay even the portion of the Changhong debt it acknowledges owing.

Internally, however, Changhong may have scored a political touchdown. According to lawyers involved in the case, Changhong submitted a report to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao shortly after it arranged to have Mr. Ji detained. The report claims that a fraud masterminded by Mr. Ji put its business, and its 36,000 workers, in grave peril.

It is unclear if Mr. Wen or other central government officials investigated the matter independently or endorsed Changhong's role in managing Mr. Ji's custody. But the lawyers involved said Changhong had boasted repeatedly about receiving Mr. Wen's support in the form of a three-point written instruction late last fall.

The prime minister praised Changhong's leadership, authorized the company to take legal actions at home and abroad to protect its interests, and ordered state banks to provide emergency financing totaling nearly $1 billion, roughly double the amount Changhong claimed Apex owed it, they said.

The ruling defused the crisis that prompted Changhong to pursue Mr. Ji. But it left the business dispute unresolved. And it left Mr. Ji in legal limbo, facing possible prosecution on the alleged fraud the company described to the leadership.

On May 28, seven months after Mr. Ji was first detained, he was handed over to the Mianyang police for formal arrest on charges of ""financial instrument fraud,"" apparently a reference to the 37 checks he wrote Changhong.

In formal police custody, Mr. Ji's conditions improved, according to the detention record. He has been allowed to visit a hospital to get treatment for hypertension, a kidney problem and a bladder infection. The interrogations ceased. American diplomats have visited him regularly, though they have not spoken publicly about the case.

In June, Apex and Changhong signed a security agreement. Apex acknowledged a $150 million debt. The debt remains unpaid, however. Apex claims it has no money.

In August, the police released Mr. Ji on restricted bail. He is allowed to move around Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, but he is under strict orders not to discuss his case with anyone. The police confiscated his passport and gave him a mobile phone that he must keep with him 24 hours a day. He has not been indicted, but the local authorities frequently remind him that they can prosecute at any time.

""They turned this into a criminal case, and now they don't know how to resolve it,"" says Mr. Hsu of Apex. ""I'm afraid we need government intervention, maybe divine intervention, to help David return home."""
123,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice,"At his most desperate, when he had no more borrowed money for his son's legal defense, Xie Yujun went to a hospital. He knew of China's black market in body parts. He wanted to sell his eyes. He was refused.

Mr. Xie, 60, is no stranger to desperate acts, if by necessity. His son was charged with a savage knife attack here in rural Anhui Province that left a mother and daughter badly wounded. The police suspected the son because of a property dispute between the families. But Mr. Xie believed the case was deeply flawed: the victims never identified the attacker. The only evidence was a questionable shoeprint. Police misconduct was blatant.

Mr. Xie's problem was convincing a court. His son's lawyers had no chance to question witnesses or, initially, to examine evidence. At one point, Mr. Xie himself sneaked into a prison to interview a witness. Even a tantalizing appeals court victory proved hollow. The son was tried again and sentenced to life in prison.

""There must be one person in the Communist Party who is honest and who believes in justice,"" Mr. Xie said. ""If I can't even find one, then the party is not going to last long.""

China's authoritarian government once relied on ideology and brute force to bind and regulate society. Now, it is asking citizens like Mr. Xie to have faith in the country's legal system to resolve disputes and mete out justice.

But Mr. Xie's plaintive cry poses a fundamental question about China's promise of rule of law: Is it possible for a criminal defendant to get a fair trial?

For most of the 56-year history of the People's Republic of China, the answer, by any standard, has been no. But in 1996, facing international and domestic pressure, China introduced reforms that expanded a criminal defendant's right to counsel and sought to create a more impartial judiciary.

Yet today the inadequacy of those reforms, and the reluctance of the ruling Communist Party to make meaningful change, is abundantly evident. The criminal trial of Mr. Xie's son was one of 770,947 adjudicated last year. Of that total, 99.7 percent ended in convictions.

Conviction rates are also high in the United States, especially in federal criminal cases. But legal experts say that American prosecutors more often decline to indict in weak cases, and that judges and juries retain the autonomy to deliver innocent verdicts in even the most high-profile cases.

The stark imbalance in China reflects a fundamental contradiction for China's top leaders. They want people like Mr. Xie to trust the legal system because public support is essential in ensuring social stability. But they believe the law should enhance, not erode, government power, and have shown little inclination to replace a system that guarantees convictions with one that guarantees the rights of the accused.

A quarter century ago, after the chaos of Mao's Cultural Revolution, China essentially had no legal system. In that context, it has made significant strides. The 1996 reforms were intended to shift toward an adversarial trial process, modeled in part after the American system. Instead, the reforms have become most notable for what was left out.

""They didn't put in rules of evidence,"" said Jonathan Hecht, deputy director of the China Law Center at Yale University. ""They didn't put in requirements that witnesses appear at trial. Lawyers weren't given the ability to really prepare a case. They kind of created the shell of an adversarial process, but they didn't create the guts of it.""

At the same time, the police, prosecutors and judges now often disregard the protections that Chinese law does offer. A defendant, for instance, has the right to see a lawyer after the initial interrogation, or usually within 24 hours. Yet a police survey in Beijing found that over the past two years, only 14.5 percent of defendants in the city had seen a lawyer in the first 48 hours.

Other obstacles facing defendants are abundant: defense lawyers deemed too aggressive can be indicted by the prosecutors opposing them in court; appellate courts rarely overturn convictions; rulings often are decided by unseen committees for whom political considerations can be as important as the law.

The problems are so flagrant that calls for reforms are coming from inside and outside the government. The National People's Congress is considering proposals for another major revamping of criminal procedure laws. In a handful of cities, experiments in reform are under way, like allowing defense lawyers to be present at interrogations. But it remains uncertain whether any changes will be approved, and, if so, what they will be.

In Chaohu, the police, prosecutors and court officials refused requests for interviews about the case of Mr. Xie's son, Xie Shude. The Chaohu Public Security Bureau described the case as ""routine."" The two victims of the attack declined to be interviewed.

But Mr. Xie's plight illustrates all the tensions and problems in the criminal justice system. He repeatedly demanded his son's rights, only to learn how circumscribed those rights were. He learned that if Chinese law does not explicitly treat a suspect as guilty until proven innocent, it does so in practice.

For more than a year, Mr. Xie navigated two trials and two appeals. Ultimately, he found his only recourse was outside the usual channels of modern jurisprudence and held a rare private meeting in June with two powerful judges.

It would be the modern equivalent of an audience with the emperor.

Father-and-Son Arrests
On the night of March 21, 2004, neighbors in the massive Xiyuan New Housing Village heard screams from a sixth-floor apartment. An intruder had repeatedly slashed a mother and daughter with a vegetable knife and escaped down the public stairwell. The case scandalized this city in the fertile, green fields of central China's breadbasket.

Two days after the attack, the police approached Xie Yujun, the father, and told him he was a suspect. He had had a property dispute with the husband of the woman who was attacked. The husband had bought an apartment from Mr. Xie but was delinquent in his payment. Mr. Xie had sued.

Mr. Xie, an emotional, combative man with a silver crew cut, said the police had demanded that he ""prove that he is innocent."" He had been jobless since being laid off by a state-owned construction company nearly a decade before. He and his wife survived on the $80 a month she earned selling vegetables. They had sold the apartment to raise money.

At the police station, investigators took Mr. Xie's fingerprints and pushed him into a bare cell for a night. Then a few minutes later, he recalled, the cell door slid open and another man was shoved inside.

""It was my son,"" Mr. Xie said.

The son, Xie Shude, 32, lived in the same apartment complex as the victim. Family members say he is the opposite of his father. If Xie Yujun can be loud and argumentative, Xie Shude is quiet and meek. Father and son had drifted apart after the son had married a peasant girl and moved out. The son sold grilled kebabs on the street and had opened a small shop.

""He has never done anything bad,"" said Huang Zeyun, 36, the son's wife. ""He would rather get taken advantage of than be in a quarrel.""

In the cell, father and son slept together on a wooden board. Both men had been fingerprinted and threatened by investigators. In an interrogation room, a detective had slammed a pistol on a table and warned Xie Shude, ""If you don't confess, we will skin you alive.""

But the son, like the father, maintained his innocence and the two men were released the next morning. Xie Yujun believes the fingerprints must not have matched.

The Chaohu attack came as unease about crime was rippling across China. Even as more Chinese were demanding legal rights, the public was also demanding that the government halt the steady rise of crime. A murder spree by a university student in western China had recently set off a nationwide manhunt and stoked public fears.

In Chaohu, the television station and newspaper gave the local knife attack a nickname, the 3/21 case, after the date it occurred. Every major government and Communist Party official in Chaohu demanded an arrest, according to the local newspaper.

Investigators must ""devote all their energy to solving the case, ease people's worries and maintain social security and stability,"" said Chen Chunyu, head of the public security bureau, according to the Chaohu Daily.

In this atmosphere, on April 9, about two weeks after he was released from jail, Mr. Xie's son disappeared.

Mr. Xie heard from neighbors that men in dark clothes had pushed his son into a car. He went to police headquarters, but no one would discuss his son's whereabouts. Only when Mr. Xie filed a missing persons report did the police admit the son was in custody. They would hold him incommunicado for seven days.

The arrest of Xie Shude was later announced in the newspaper. The stated motive was revenge over the property dispute. The police had used those seven days to extract two pieces of evidence: a shoeprint and a confession.

A Taste of Chinese Justice
For Xie Yujun, the first obstacle to mounting his son's defense was money. He approached friends and relatives for loans, promising repayment after his son's exoneration. He was convinced of his son's innocence after their night together in jail.

""I thought telling the truth was the only way out,"" the father recalled. ""I told him if he really did it, he would have to confess.

""My son said, 'Really, I did not do it.'""

Mr. Xie felt his obligation was not only to his son. In traditional Chinese society, where respect, or ""face,"" is a paramount virtue, the arrest had stained the reputation of his entire extended family. Some elderly family members had even ceased their outdoor exercises to avoid seeing neighbors. As the father, Mr. Xie was obligated by Chinese tradition to cleanse the stain.

""It has put shame on the whole family,"" he said of the case.

Mr. Xie knew little about the law. As a teenager, he had missed an education when Mao ordered millions of city dwellers to labor in the countryside. But he started buying books on criminal procedure law. He also visited law firms to ask questions.

He concluded that the case against his son was riddled with flaws. The indictment accused the son of acting out of ""revenge"" over his father's property dispute. But the indictment failed to mention that Mr. Xie had already won the lawsuit. At the time of the attack Mr. Xie was waiting for the family to pay him about $600 and, he said, the payment period had not expired.

The police produced jailhouse witnesses who claimed to have overheard the son confess to the attack. But Mr. Xie pretended to be a relative and slipped into the prison. He recorded one of the witnesses saying that the police had coerced his testimony. Later, Mr. Xie handed the tape to the judge.

The son's confessions also proved coerced. The son had made eight confessions and one recantation. But he later told lawyers and family members that police beat him with sticks and kept him awake for seven days. He said he had confessed to end the torment.

""I told him I didn't blame him for going along with the confession,"" Mr. Xie said. ""I understood.""

The victims' account of the attack also raised questions. At the crime scene, the husband told the police that his wife had seen three attackers. But, later, the wife told the police she had seen only one. Court papers show she did not initially identify her attacker. Later, she said, ""I suspect it must have been somebody in Xie Yujun's family,"" court documents show.

Ultimately, the prosecution's case depended on the shoeprint. Forensic evidence is often unreliable in China, partly because the country has no uniform forensic rules. In Chaohu, prosecutors would boast of ample forensic evidence, including fingerprints, but only the shoeprint was introduced in the trial. Court documents say the print was taken from the sole of a Yi'erkang brand leather shoe.

Investigators in Chaohu never found a shoe that matched the print. But the police bought an identical Yi'erkang shoe and ordered Xie Shude to make a fresh print to compare with the one they had. A police academy in northeast China then concluded that print matched the crime scene print because both were ""slightly turned inward"" and ""landing on the outside.""

Mr. Xie knew nothing about forensics but tried to hire a private firm in Shanghai for an independent analysis. The firm told him it worked only with the government. Eventually, Mr. Xie had to ask the Chaohu court to find him an expert. They found a retired government forensics specialist. He confirmed the prosecution's report.

Mr. Xie placed his hopes with Jiang Shengchao, a lawyer with political connections and a good reputation. But Mr. Jiang quickly met problems. The police blocked him from meeting his client. Desperate, Mr. Xie traveled to the provincial capital, Hefei, to petition higher officials to intervene. Two months after the arrest, the lawyer finally saw his client.

The trial was held in October 2004 in Chaohu Intermediate Court. It lasted a single day. Mr. Jiang was not allowed to review the evidence, nor did Mr. Xie's son have a chance to face his accuser. No witnesses were called. Their testimony was entered into the record, but Mr. Jiang was given no chance to question them. Chinese law requires that evidence be subjected to cross-examination, but legal analysts say this requirement is regularly overlooked.

In arguing the case, Mr. Jiang also faced restrictions. ""I remember how the judge intervened every time the lawyer was trying to say something important,"" said Ms. Huang, the defendant's wife. ""He would just say, 'Hurry up and make it simple.' ""

On Oct. 12, the court found Xie Shude guilty and awarded compensation of nearly $10,000 to the victims. Mr. Xie responded by hiring a new lawyer, Li Ping, for his appeal to the Anhui Province High Court.

In December, the High Court overruled the guilty verdict, citing ""insufficient evidence"" and ""certain unclear facts.""

""I thought that showed justice,"" the father said.

But the ruling did not mean the case was over. Appellate courts in China rarely release defendants, even if ruling in their favor. Instead, the case was returned to Chaohu Intermediate Court for a new trial. The High Court also sent a confidential letter to prosecutors, a customary practice, with instructions on how to bolster their case.

Even so, the defense had made an unexpected discovery: Ms. Li had been allowed to examine the evidence and noticed that the digital photograph of the shoeprint from the crime scene was dated in April, a month after the attack.

It raised obvious questions: Did the police simply manufacture the shoeprint? If not, was the print reliable, given the number of people who had trampled through the crime scene during the month after the attack?

Ms. Li raised these questions to no avail. The trial lasted only a few hours and resulted in another guilty verdict. Mr. Xie was disappointed, but he assumed that the High Court would again overturn the verdict since the prosecutors had not presented any new evidence.

He would be wrong.

Kafkaesque Appeals 
The High Court is the most powerful judicial body in Anhui Province, yet it should not be confused with appellate courts operating in the United States. The High Court is a political body as much as an arbiter of law.

This distinction would become apparent in Xie Shude's two appeals. The first, successful appeal had been reviewed by a panel of three judges. A provincial official familiar with the workings of the High Court said the three judges reviewed the case strictly on its legal merits.



But the second appeal, in April 2005, was different. Five judges were listed on the ruling. A second provincial official confirmed that those five judges were actually part of a much larger trial committee within the court that oversaw the review.

The two provincial officials, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, said the judges were sharply divided over the case. Some thought it was without merit. Even so, their authority was limited: Chinese law does not allow judges to throw out evidence or overturn convictions on the basis of police misconduct.

More significant, the two officials said the High Court was reluctant to overturn any conviction because that might damage its relationships with prosecutors and police, as well as with Communist Party leaders eager to be seen as cracking down on crime.

Finally, the two officials said, judges sometimes simply ignore evidence and consider what they perceive to be the greater societal good -- in this case, a conviction to soothe public anxiety about a grisly crime.

""In China,"" said one of the provincial officials, ""the rules sometimes do not matter."" The official added, ""If you go after legal justice, it might cause more harm to social stability.""

The High Court handed down its second ruling in the case of Mr. Xie's son in May. This time, the court upheld the conviction and even seemed to switch the burden of proof. If before it blamed the prosecution for lacking evidence, it now blamed the defense for not introducing new evidence.

It was as if Xie Shude had been presumed guilty unless proven innocent.

A Last Hope
In June, Xie Yujun traveled to the High Court, clutching a ticket to meet with officials. His was not a formal legal appeal but rather a petition in the feudal tradition of ancient China.

He could no longer afford a lawyer. But he had fallen to his knees before a young law student and begged for help. The law student, joined by another student, met Mr. Xie at the High Court and later provided written accounts of the meeting.

The three rode an elevator to a private upstairs room and sat at a long table opposite two judges and their aides. Attendants poured glasses of hot water. Mr. Xie described the case until the older of the two judges chuckled. He said they knew the case because they had been involved in upholding the conviction.

The younger judge conceded the case had problems. He agreed the confession was coerced. But he defended the shoeprint and changed the subject when the law students peppered him with questions.

The older judge did not bother with intricacies of law. He advised Mr. Xie that he could eventually petition to reopen the case. But first he recommended that Mr. Xie regularly visit his son in prison. ""Really get to know him,"" he said. ""Make sure you are convinced he is innocent.""

Mr. Xie boiled with anger as the judge offered his final advice.

""There's no hurry,"" the older judge added. ""After all, it's a life sentence."""
124,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice," Judge Li Huijuan happened to be in the courthouse file room when clerks, acting on urgent orders, began searching for a ruling on a mundane case about seed prices. ""I handled that case,"" Judge Li told the clerks, surprised that anyone would be interested.

But within days, the Luoyang Middle Court's discipline committee contacted her. Provincial officials had angrily complained that the ruling contained a serious political error. Faced with a conflict between national and provincial law, Judge Li had declared the provincial law invalid. In doing so, she unwittingly made legal history, setting in motion a national debate about judicial independence in China's closed political system.

In many countries, including the United States, a judge tossing out a lower-level law would scarcely merit attention. But in China, the government, not a court, is the final arbiter of law. What Judge Li had considered judicial common sense, provincial legislators considered a judicial revolt. Their initial response was to try to crush it. Judge Li, who had on the bench less than three years, feared her career might be finished.

""An order by those in power has forced local leaders, none of whom dared to stand on principle, to sacrifice me,"" she wrote in rebuttal. ""I'm just an ordinary person, a female judge who tried to protect the law. Who is going to protect my rights?""

Faced with the complex demands of governing a chaotic, modernizing country, China's leaders have embraced the rule of law as the most efficient means of regulating society. But a central requirement in fulfilling that promise lies unresolved -- whether the governing Communist Party intends to allow an independent judiciary.

The 2003 ruling by Judge Li has become, quite unexpectedly, a landmark case for the evolving Chinese legal system. Her plight exposed the limits on judicial autonomy in China and the political retribution faced by judges. But it also revealed the rising influence of legal reformers. Scholars and lawyers rallied to Judge Li's defense and embraced her ruling as a test case, if an accidental one, for a more autonomous court system.

""For the first time, a judge announced a local law or regulation was void,"" said Xiao Taifu, a member of the Beijing Lawyers Association, which petitioned the central government on Judge Li's behalf. ""It was historic. For the legal process in China, it was a first, and it carried deep meaning.""

Today, China's court system is far from an independent entity that can curb government power. Often, the courts remain a pliable tool to reinforce that power. Many judges are poorly educated in the law and corrupt. Judges often must answer to government officials as much as to the law. Political pressure is common, and private trial committees often dictate rulings.

There are also signs of change. One of the busiest courts in Beijing announced in November that it would stop punishing judges if a ruling was later deemed politically or legally ""wrong."" A budding idealism about the law, and its potential to transform Chinese society, is evident not only in the number of new lawyers but also in the emerging civic belief that ordinary people have ""legal rights.""

The case of Judge Li illustrates how such changes continue to meet enormous resistance within the system. Judge Li, now 32, a Communist Party member, is among the new generation of younger judges expected to become the future backbone of a strengthened court system.

That Judge Li and others granted interviews for this article reflects, to some extent, the evolution of China's legal system and an effort by the judiciary to be more assertive. But the dispute over the seed case taught her that being a judge involved far more than simply interpreting laws. ""When I look back on the cases I dealt with, I have no regrets,"" she said. ""I don't think any of the parties involved can complain."" But, she added, any judge who acts on conscience does so at a risk.

""I think my colleagues and supervisors think I'm naïve,"" she said. ""And they think I'm not wise.""

Youthful Ideals Meet Reality
As a teenager, Li Huijuan first saw a judge as a character in a television soap opera. She grew up in southern Henan Province in the city of Nanyang, where she watched dramas about judges in ancient China. Their passion for justice was scripted, but it inspired a young girl.

""I saw these images of judges and lawyers defending the people,"" she said. ""I thought it was glorious.""

She was one of three children, and her father was a government official who oversaw local markets to ensure that merchants and vendors abided by city rules and regulations. To curry favor with her father, vendors often visited the family's apartment at night, banging on the door with offers of gifts or bribes.

""My father never accepted,"" Judge Li recalled. ""He lectured them and drove them out. I think I have the same stubbornness in my character. My parents taught me to be a straightforward, honest person.""

Her two siblings became teachers, an honored profession in China, but Li Huijuan graduated from Henan University with a four-year degree in law. She later earned a master's degree in law at the prestigious University of Politics and Law in Beijing. Her qualifications placed her in an elite circle at a time when China was starting to introduce new, tougher standards for the legal profession. Even so, she said much of her education had been ""more like legal theory.""

""The teacher was telling us how it should be,"" she recalled of her undergraduate studies. ""But they did not teach us how it really worked in China.""

She began learning that lesson in 1996 after she started working at the Middle Court in Luoyang in Henan's north. She arrived at a courthouse dominated by older judges, some with limited legal education, including retired soldiers given judgeships to reward them for serving their country. Her naïve belief that judges ruled independently -- as they did on television -- was quickly dispelled.

Instead, she learned that cases were heard by panels of judges, whose rulings were often reviewed by supervisors or, in major cases, by private trial committees of court officials. Judges were held responsible for rulings that carried their name, even if others in the court actually made the decision. But if government officials or influential citizens complained about a ruling, a judge could be punished, fined or even fired.

Some judges tried to reduce the pressure of a potential mistake by taking on fewer cases. ""The less you do,"" Judge Li said, ""the fewer mistakes you make.""

She began as a court secretary but quickly qualified as a judge and, later, as a presiding judge. In January 2003, she was named presiding judge over a three-judge panel hearing a dispute between two local companies over the price of seeds. The legal dispute revolved around a conflict between provincial and national law, but Judge Li never anticipated that that would bring her trouble.

Instead, the political subtext of the case -- the parochial interests of two local companies fighting over thousands of dollars -- infused the process. At one point, a city official forwarded a letter from one company to Judge Li's supervisor. In the margin, the official had written an instruction for the court: ""Please pay attention.""

""I felt quite uncomfortable when I received the letter,"" she said. ""I felt they were making assumptions that I was already taking sides. I didn't do anything about it. I just put it in the files.""

At another point, the director of the Luoyang court -- since replaced on an unrelated matter -- telephoned Judge Li. A representative from one of the companies was in his office. Could she meet with him?

""I considered this very inappropriate,"" Judge Li said. ""But I couldn't say so because of the director. So I told the man to come to my office.""

When he arrived, Judge Li said, she pretended to be stuck on a long telephone call. Exasperated, the man finally left.

A System Grappling With Reform
Legal experts say political pressure on judges is routine and derives, in part, from the subservient status of the court system within the Chinese bureaucracy. Nationally, the chief judge of the People's Supreme Court is not even a member of the Politburo, the inner decision-making entity of the Communist Party. By comparison, the head of the Ministry of Public Security is a member.

Locally, judges are appointed by their people's congresses, while the courts receive their budget from local governments. In addition, branches of the Communist Party operate committees that can apply pressure and exert influence on a court behind the scenes.

Earlier this year, a presiding judge in the northeastern city of Harbin told Workers' Daily, a state-controlled newspaper, that government officials had overruled three different innocent verdicts and ordered the courts to convict a local businessman of fraud. The presiding judge was later censured for publicizing the case.

The system also can make it easy for corrupt court officials to exploit their position. In April 2004, two vice directors of the Middle Court in Wuhan, a large city in central China, were sentenced to prison for selling verdicts in exchange for $500,000 in bribes. The directors paid judges to participate in the scheme.

Many legal reformers believe the court system must become more autonomous to eliminate corruption in the legal system. But in seeking more authority, they also are trying to rapidly modernize the system and improve judicial training to counter public perceptions that too many judges are corrupt or unqualified. ""The public may be skeptical about judicial independence, given the quality of judges and judgments,"" said He Weifang, a prominent constitutional scholar. ""But if you want accountability, you can only have accountability if you have independence. Otherwise, it is never clear who made a decision.""

On the campus of the National Judges College on the outskirts of Beijing, the primary educational arm of the People's Supreme Court, roughly 10,000 judges spend a month of every year on professional training. In the past, judges were taught to serve the interests of the Communist Party, but now a different message is emphasized.

""We train them with a modern theory of law: that the courts are impartial, on the need for legal justice and of innocence until proven guilty,"" said Huai Xiaofeng, president of the college. ""We stress that during a trial, you cannot favor the government or the National People's Congress. In the past, they told them to emphasize the political qualities.

""Now, we tell them to emphasize the law and the facts.""

For Judge Li, the reaction to the ruling on the seed case proved how political considerations remained deeply embedded in the legal system. Because the case seemed likely to provoke controversy, she had submitted a draft ruling to the court director, who in turn forwarded it to a trial committee. Everyone signed off, and both parties were informed in June 2003.

But by October, word of the case had reached the Henan Province People's Congress, the provincial legislature. In the legal affairs office, the ruling was interpreted as a naked challenge to the lawmaking authority of the People's Congress. Provincial officials publicly described the ruling as ""a serious breach of law.""

""The authority of the National People's Congress system is not to be challenged,"" said Mao Yinduan, head of the legal office, in an interview. ""The judge in this case was very young and had little experience. She had every right to choose which law to use. But courts have no right in a verdict to say which law is invalid.""

The reaction stunned Judge Li. To research the verdict, she had studied Chinese law, as well as the speeches of senior political leaders. China's Law on Legislation stated that local laws that conflicted with national laws should be abolished. She thought including this point in her opinion was within her judicial purview.

She had not intended to challenge the political system, nor, apparently, did her director or anyone on the trial committee. ""He read the verdict and didn't realize the significance of what it said,"" Judge Li said of the director. ""I, at first, didn't realize the significance, either.""

But Judge Li, not the court officials who had approved the decision, faced the possibility of serious punishment. ""I felt persecuted,"" she recalled. ""Everyone I talked to told me what I had done was wrong.""

Job Saved but System Unchanged
Anxious and uncertain of her future, Li Huijuan telephoned her husband, Chang Jianyi. High school sweethearts, they married in 1999 but lived apart because Mr. Chang worked in Beijing as a software developer. His wife reached him on a business trip to Tibet, and he advised her to seek help in Beijing. He believed she had been wronged.

""She had to fight back to restore her reputation and her dignity,"" Mr. Chang said. ""If she did not fight back, she would have to live with the stain.""

She left for Beijing and planned to seek help from an association of women in the judiciary. She wrote a long passionate letter in which she promised to ""undergo criticism and education"" if she had erred. ""But if I'm right, I will protect my integrity and defend the integrity of the law, even if it means being like a moth that flies into a flame.""

At the association's office, a woman told her that she had been treated too harshly and agreed to contact someone at the People's Supreme Court. Then the case attracted the attention of the Chinese news media and of scholars and lawyers pushing for legal reform.

Mr. He, the constitutional scholar, rose to her defense in an op-ed article. In an interview, he characterized the seed case as one of the most important in the legal evolution of China because of the attention it focused on judicial independence.

""It may not be Marbury v. Madison,"" Mr. He said of the landmark case credited with establishing the authority of the United States Supreme Court, ""but it is a very important case.""

As it turned out, Judge Li had stumbled upon a fundamental contradiction. In the Chinese system, based loosely on European models and the old Soviet structure, judges are supposed to refer conflicts in law for review by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's center of legislative power. Judges are then expected to follow the decision made by the Standing Committee.

Yet, in practical terms, those referrals rarely happen and when they do, the Standing Committee has rarely showed interest in the housekeeping role. As a result, judges have become accustomed to assuming this role, if doing so silently, and then simply leaving the conflicting law untouched.

To many lawyers, the system was grossly inefficient and outdated. Mr. Xiao, the Beijing lawyer, joined three other lawyers in formally requesting that the National People's Congress review the situation. Scholars organized a legal conference at the elite Tsinghua University to debate the seed case and other issues about judicial autonomy. The public attention, and the possible intervention on her behalf by the People's Supreme Court, apparently saved Judge Li's career. She returned to work in summer 2004 before leaving on maternity leave later that year. She is now in Beijing on a leave to continue her legal studies.

But the system remained largely intact. In summer 2004, the Standing Committee announced the creation of a new review panel to mediate conflicts of law. Some lawyers have hailed the panel as the equivalent of a constitutional court. Others are concerned about the panel's secrecy and believe the responsibility should belong to the courts.

Judge Li still believes in the rule of law, but she is no longer the impressionable teenager who watched soap operas about judges. ""Judges are confused,"" she said. ""It is not that they do not know how to do cases professionally. It is just all these relationships to coordinate. And they also have to weigh consequences.""

In 2004, Henan's High Court reheard the seed case. It ruled exactly as Judge Li had, with one exception: it criticized her for invalidating the provincial law."
125,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice,"One November morning, the Beijing Judicial Bureau convened a hearing on its decree that one of China's best-known law firms must shut down for a year because it failed to file a change of address form when it moved offices.

The same morning, Gao Zhisheng, the firm's founder and star litigator, was 1,800 miles away in Xinjiang, in the remote west. He skipped what he called the ""absurd and corrupt"" hearing so he could rally members of an underground Christian church to sue China's secret police.

""I can't guarantee that you will win the lawsuit -- in fact you will almost certainly lose,"" Mr. Gao told one church member who had been detained in a raid. ""But I warn you that if you are too timid to confront their barbaric behavior, you will be completely defeated.""

The advice could well summarize Mr. Gao's own fateful clash with the authorities. Bold, brusque and often roused to fiery indignation, Mr. Gao, 41, is one of a handful of self-proclaimed legal ""rights defenders.""

He travels the country filing lawsuits over corruption, land seizures, police abuses and religious freedom. His opponent is usually the same: the ruling Communist Party.

Now, the party has told him to cease and desist. The order to suspend his firm's operating license was expanded last week to include his personal permit to practice law. The authorities threatened to confiscate it by force if Mr. Gao fails to hand it over voluntarily by Wednesday.

Secret police now watch his home and follow him wherever he goes, he says.

He has become the most prominent in a string of outspoken lawyers facing persecution. One was jailed this summer while helping clients appeal the confiscation of their oil wells. A second was driven into exile last spring after he zealously defended a third lawyer, who was convicted of leaking state secrets.

Together, they have effectively put the rule of law itself on trial, with lawyers often acting as both plaintiffs and defendants.

""People across this country are awakening to their rights and seizing on the promise of the law,"" Mr. Gao says. ""But you cannot be a rights lawyer in this country without becoming a rights case yourself.""

Ordinary citizens in fact have embraced the law as eagerly as they have welcomed another Western-inspired import, capitalism. The number of civil cases heard last year hit 4.3 million, up 30 percent in five years, and lawyers have encouraged the notion that the courts can hold anyone, even party bosses, responsible for their actions.

Chinese leaders do not discourage such ideas, entirely. They need the law to check corruption and to persuade the outside world that China is not governed by the whims of party leaders.

But the officials draw the line at any fundamental challenge to their monopoly on power.

Judges take orders from party-controlled trial committees. Lawyers operate more autonomously but often face criminal prosecution if they stir up public disorder or disclose details about legal matters that the party deems secret.

The struggle of Mr. Gao and others like him may well determine whether China's legal system evolves from its subordinate role into something grander, an independent force that can curtail abuses of power at all levels and, ultimately, protect the rights of individuals against the state.

""We have all tried to shine sunlight on the abuses in the system,"" says Li Heping, another Beijing-based lawyer who has accepted political cases. ""Gao has his own special style. He is fearless. And he knows the law.""

An Air of Authority
Mr. Gao can cite chapter and verse of China's legal code, having committed it to memory in intensive self-study. He is an army veteran and a longtime member of the Communist Party.

On a recent trip to rural Shaanxi Province, where he sneaked into a coal mine to gather evidence in a lawsuit against mine owners, he wore a crisp white shirt and tie and shiny black loafers, as if preparing for a day in court.

He is also a flagrant dissident. Tall and big-boned, he has the booming voice of a person used to commanding a room. When he holds forth, it is often on the evils of one-party rule. ""Barbaric"" and ""reactionary"" are his favorite adjectives for describing party leaders.

""Most officials in China are basically mafia bosses who use extreme barbaric methods to terrorize the people and keep them from using the law to protect their rights,"" Mr. Gao wrote on one essay that circulated widely on the Web this fall.

After an early career that racked up notable courtroom victories, he has plunged headlong into cases that he knows are unwinnable. He has done pro bono work for members of the Falun Gong religious sect, displaced homeowners, underground Christians, fellow lawyers and democracy activists. When the courts reject his filings, as they often do, he uses the Internet to rally public opinion.

His fevered assaults have a messianic ring. But although he became a Christian this fall and began attending services in an underground church, the motivation to pursue the most sensitive cases -- and put his practice and possibly his freedom at risk -- began a couple of years earlier. It was then that his idealistic beginnings as a peasant boy turned big-city lawyer gave way to simmering rage.

Mr. Gao was born in a cave. His family lived in a mud-walled home dug out of a hillside in the loess plateau in Shaanxi Province, in northwestern China. His father died at age 40. For years the boy climbed into bed at dusk because his family could not afford oil for its lamp, he recalled.

Nor could they pay for elementary school for Mr. Gao and his six siblings. But he said he listened outside the classroom window. Later, with the help of an uncle, he attended junior high and became adept enough at reading and writing to achieve what was then his dream: to join the People's Liberation Army.

Stationed at a base in Kashgar, in Xinjiang region, he received a secondary-school education and became a party member. But his fate changed even more decisively after he left the service and began working as a food vendor. One day in 1991 he browsed a newspaper used to wrap a bundle of garlic. He spotted an article that mentioned a plan by Deng Xiaoping, then China's paramount leader, to train 150,000 new lawyers and develop the legal system.

""Deng said China must be governed by law,"" Mr. Gao said. ""I believed him.""

He scraped together the funds to take a self-taught course on the law. The course mostly required a prodigious memory for titles and clauses, which he had. He passed the tests easily. Anticipating a future as a public figure, he took walks in the early morning light, pretending fields of wheat were auditoriums full of important officials. He delivered full-throated lectures to quivering stalks.

By the late 1990's, though based in remote Xinjiang, he developed a winning reputation. He represented the family of a boy who sank into a coma when a doctor mistakenly gave him an intravenous dose of ethanol. He won a $100,000 payout, then a headline-generating sum, in a case involving a boy who had lost his hearing in a botched operation.

He also won a lawsuit on behalf of a private businessman in Xinjiang. The entrepreneur had taken control of a troubled state-owned company, but a district government used force to reclaim it after the businessmen turned it into a profit-making entity. China's highest court backed the businessman and Mr. Gao.

""It felt like a golden age,"" he said, ""when the law seemed to have real power.""

That optimism did not last long. His victory in the privatization case made him a target of local leaders in Xinjiang, who warned clients and court officials to shun him, he said. He moved to Beijing in 2000 and set up a new practice with half a dozen lawyers. But he said he felt like an outsider in the capital, battling an impenetrable bureaucracy.

The Beijing Judicial Bureau, an administrative agency that has supervisory authority over law firms registered in the capital, charged high fees and often interfered in what he considered his private business.

One of his first big cases in Beijing involved a client who had his home confiscated for a building project connected with the 2008 Summer Olympics. Like many residents of inner-city courtyard homes, his client received what he considered paltry compensation to make way for developers.

When Mr. Gao attempted to file a lawsuit on his client's behalf, he was handed an internal document drafted by the central government that instructed all district courts to reject cases involving such land disputes. ""It was a blatantly illegal document, but every court in Beijing blindly obeyed it,"" he said.

In the spring of 2003, Beijing was panicking about the spread of SARS, a sometimes fatal respiratory affliction, and Mr. Gao was fuming about forced removals. He gave an interview to a reporter for The China Economic Times arguing that SARS was much less scary than collusion between officials and developers.

""The law is designed precisely to resolve these sorts of competing interests,"" he said in that interview. ""But their orders strip away the original logic of the law and make it a pawn of the powerful and the corrupt.""

An Empty Promise
Mr. Gao is not the first lawyer to test China's commitment to the law. Even in the earliest days of market-oriented economic reforms, when the legal system was still a hollow shell, a few defense lawyers quixotically challenged the ruling party to respect international legal norms.

One such advocate is Zhang Sizhi, a dean of defense lawyers, who has accepted dozens of long-shot cases that he views as advancing the law. He defended Jiang Qing, Mao's wife, when she faced trial after the Cultural Revolution. He also represented Wei Jingsheng, perhaps China's best-known dissident.

Mr. Zhang argues that lawyers have prodded the party to develop a more impartial judiciary. But, he says, they must do so with small, carefully calibrated jolts of legal pressure.

""The system is improving incrementally,"" he said. ""If you go too far, you will only hurt the chances of legal reform, as well as the interests of your client.""

That view may reflect a consensus among seasoned legal scholars. But Mr. Gao is 37 years younger than Mr. Zhang, far less patient, and after his initial burst of idealism, deeply cynical.

If Mr. Zhang's benchmark for progress is that every criminal suspect has the right to a legal defense, Mr. Gao's became the 1989 Administrative Procedure Law, which for the first time gave Chinese citizens the right to sue state agencies. By his reckoning, it remains an empty promise.

""The leaders of China see no other purpose for the law but to protect and disguise their own power,"" Mr. Gao said. ""As a lawyer, my goal is to turn their charade into a reality.""

Following his defeat in the Beijing land dispute he plunged into the biggest land case he could find, a prolonged battle over hundreds of acres of farmland that Guangdong Province had seized to construct a university. Legally, he hit another brick wall. But he fired off scores of angry missives about the ""brazen murderous schemes"" of Guangdong officials. The storm of public anger he helped stir up got his clients more generous compensation.

Mr. Gao said he was told later that the party secretary of Guangdong, Zhang Dejiang, had labeled him a mingyun fenzi, a dangerous man on a mission. ""He was right,"" Mr. Gao said.

This summer, a fellow lawyer-activist named Zhu Jiuhu was detained for ""disturbing public order"" while representing private investors in oil wells that were seized by the government in Shaanxi, Mr. Gao's home province.

Mr. Gao rushed to Mr. Zhu's defense with fellow lawyers, local journalists and tape recorders. He camped out in local government offices until officials agreed to meet him. He told one party boss that ""he would forever be on the wrong side of the law and on the wrong side of the conscience of the people"" unless he let Mr. Zhu go, according to a recording of the conversation.

After the intensive publicity campaign, Mr. Zhu was freed this fall, though under a highly restrictive bail arrangement that prevents him from practicing law.

Most provocatively, Mr. Gao has defended adherents of Falun Gong, a quasi-Buddhist religious sect that the party outlawed as a major threat to national security in 1999.

Mr. Gao has been blocked from filing lawsuits on behalf of Falun Gong members. But in open letters to the leadership, he said the secret police had tortured sect members to make them renounce Falun Gong. He described a police-run, extra-judicial ""brainwashing base"" where, he said, one client was first starved and then force-fed until he threw up. Another of his Falun Gong clients, he says, was raped while in police custody.

""These calamitous deeds did not begin with the two of you,"" he wrote in a letter addressed to President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. ""But they have continued under your political watch, and it is a crime that you have not stopped them.""

The Police Circle
The crackdown came first as a courtesy call.

Two men wearing suit jackets and ties, having set up an appointment, visited his office. They identified themselves as agents of State Security, the internal secret police, but mostly made small talk until one of them mentioned the open letter Mr. Gao had written on Falun Gong.

""They suggested that Falun Gong was more of a political issue than a legal issue and maybe it was best left to the politicians,"" Mr. Gao recalled. ""They were very polite.""

When they prepared to leave, however, one of them said, ""You must be proud of what you have achieved as a lawyer after your self-study. Certainly you must be worried should something happen to derail that.""

Mr. Gao said he talked to his wife and considered the future of his two children. He wondered whether he could still afford his Beijing apartment and his car if his business collapsed.

""Anyone who says he does not consider this kind of pressure is lying,"" Mr. Gao said. ""But I also felt more than ever that I was putting pressure on this reactionary system. I did not want to give that up.""

His resistance hardened. The Beijing Judicial Bureau handed him a list of cases and clients that were off limits, including Falun Gong, the Shaanxi oil case and a recent incident of political unrest in Taishi, a village in Guangdong. He refused to drop any of them, arguing that the bureau had no legal authority to dictate what cases he accepts or rejects.

This fall, he said, security agents have followed him constantly. He said his apartment courtyard has become a ""plainclothes policeman's club,"" with up to 20 officers stationed outside. He and his wife bring them hot water on cold nights.

On Nov. 4, shortly after being warned to retract a second open letter about his Falun Gong cases, Mr. Gao received a new summons from the judicial bureau.

This time, the bureau provided a written notice that said it had conducted routine inspections of 58 law firms in Beijing. Mr. Gao's, it was discovered, had moved offices and failed to promptly register the new address, which it called a serious violation of the Law on Managing the Registration of Law Firms. He was ordered to suspend operations for a year.

When the requisite public hearing was held, Mr. Gao sent two lawyers to represent him. But he boarded a plane for Xinjiang, where he had a medical case pending and where he wanted to inquire about abuses against members of an underground Christian church.

The edict was not only not overturned after the hearing, it was broadened. By late November, the bureau issued a new notice demanding that Mr. Gao hand over his personal law license as well as his firm's operating permit. Both had to be in the hands of the bureau by Dec. 14. The authority would otherwise ""use force according to law to carry it out.""

When he received that second order, Mr. Gao had escaped his police tail and traveled to a location in northern China that he asked to keep secret. He was conducting a new investigation into torture of Falun Gong adherents. A steady stream of sect members visited him in the ramshackle apartment he is using as a safe house. He tries to meet at least four each day, taking their stories down long hand.

""I'm not sure how much time I have left to conduct my work,"" Mr. Gao said. ""But I will use every minute to expose the barbaric tactics of our leadership."""
126,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice,"Far from the pulsing cities that symbolize modern China, this tiny hillside village of crude peasant houses seems disconnected from this century and the last. But follow a dirt path past a snarling watchdog, sidestep the chickens and ducks, and a small clearing on the banks of the Nu River reveals a dusty slab of concrete lying in a rotting pumpkin patch.

The innocuous concrete block is also a symbol, of a struggle over law that touches every corner of the country.

The block marks the spot on the Nu River where officials here in Yunnan Province want to begin building one of the biggest dam projects in the world. The project would produce more electricity than even the mighty Three Gorges Dam but would also threaten a region considered an ecological treasure. This village would be the first place to disappear.

For decades, the ruling Communist Party has rammed through such projects by fiat. But the Nu River proposal, already delayed for more than a year, is now unexpectedly presenting the Chinese government with a quandary of its own making: will it abide by its own laws?

A coalition led by Chinese environmental groups is urging the central government to hold open hearings and make public a secret report on the Nu dams before making a final decision. In a country where people cannot challenge decisions by their leaders, such public participation is a fairly radical idea. But the groups argue that new environmental laws grant exactly that right.

""This is the case to set a precedent,"" said Ma Jun, an environmental consultant in Beijing. ""For the first time, there is a legal basis for public participation. If it happens, it would be a major step forward.""

China's leaders often embrace the concept of rule of law, if leaving open how they choose to define it. For many people in China's fledgling ""civil society"" -- environmentalists, journalists, lawyers, academics and others -- the law has become a tool to promote environmental protection and to try to expand the rights of individuals in an authoritarian political system.

But trying to invoke the law is risky. Chinese nongovernmental organizations, few of which existed a decade ago, have taken up the Nu as a major cause. But the activism on the Nu and other issues has provoked deep suspicions by the Communist Party even as a broader clampdown against such NGO's has forced some to shut down. The government knows China has a drastic pollution problem and has passed new environmental laws. But top leaders also demand high economic growth and need to increase energy supplies to get it. The ""green laws"" are becoming a crucible to test which side will prevail and whether ordinary people can take part in the process.

The closed process that led to the Three Gorges Dam is what opponents of the Nu dams most want to avoid. In the late 1980's, a wide range of intellectuals and others tried in vain to force public hearings to discuss the environmental and social costs of a project that has flooded a vast region and forced huge relocations. Ultimately, opponents could only muster a symbolic victory as the final vote in the National People's Congress included an unusually high number of abstentions or nay votes.

The central government is still deliberating how to proceed on the Nu. Domestic media coverage has been banned in recent months. Three central government ministries refused interview requests, as did provincial officials in Yunnan. Local officials along the Nu River, after initially agreeing to an interview, failed to reply to a list of written questions.

Out in the jagged mountains along China's remote southwestern border, villagers in Xiaoshaba gather information about their future from rumors. In early December, a team of surveyors inventoried property and measured the narrow terrace of village farmland along the Nu. Several villagers say local officials have told them that everyone would be relocated around the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, which ends in early February -- even if the dams have not yet been approved.

""If they tell me to move,"" said one villager, Zhang Jianhua, ""I have no other choice.""

A Legal Reprieve
In the spring of 2003, a slender, studious man named Yu Xiaogang learned that the hydropower industry was eyeing the rivers of southwestern China. Mr. Yu, an environmental resources manager, knew that China believed that hydropower was a cleaner alternative for its energy shortages and that the Nu was considered one of the country's richest, untapped resources. But he and others believed that the Nu would be untouchable.

The Nu, which translates as Angry River, roars out of the Tibetan Plateau east of the Himalayas and plunges through steep canyons just inside the border with Myanmar, formerly Burma, as it careers south before crossing the border.

In China, it passes through a mountainous region with more than 7,000 species of plants and 80 rare or endangered animals and fish. Unesco said the region ""may be the most biologically diverse temperate ecosystem in the world"" and designated it a World Heritage Site in the summer of 2003.

""We were very happy because we thought the Nu would be protected and would have no problems,"" said Mr. Yu, who also led Green Watershed, an environmental NGO.

But not long after the World Heritage designation, a state-run provincial newspaper announced that a public-private consortium planned to build 13 dams on the river. The project would be the largest cascade dam system in the world, and it appeared politically unstoppable.

The majority partner, the China Huadian Corporation, was a state-owned goliath; the local government was a minority partner. In Beijing, the State Development and Reform Commission, a powerful government ministry, had approved the dams in August and planned to present the plan to the State Council, or the Chinese cabinet, for final approval. Construction would begin in September 2003.

The environmental community was blindsided. More than 50,000 people, most of them from ethnic minority hill tribes, would be relocated. The Nu also was one of only two free flowing rivers in China. The State Environmental Protection Administration, or SEPA, the country's environmental watchdog, criticized the project in its official newspaper. But SEPA was considered one of the weakest ministries in the central government.

Then, a snag arose -- a bureaucratic delay, hardly uncommon in China. August became September and the proposal had not yet been presented for final approval. During the delay, a new environmental law took effect on Sept. 1. Based on an American model, the China Environmental Impact Assessment Law required comprehensive environmental reviews in the planning stages of major public and private development projects.

Decades of relentless economic growth had left China with dire pollution problems and squandered natural resources. President Hu Jintao had made ""sustainable development"" a new government mantra. The assessment law gave the environmental agency new powers to handle and approve environmental reviews before a project was approved. It also called for public participation, including hearings, as part of the review, though it did not detail specific guidelines.

But it would take public pressure to force action on the Nu case. Despite its uniqueness and natural beauty, the Nu was not well known, largely because of its isolated location.

In September 2003, an environmental conference in Beijing brought together academics, government environmental officials and NGO's to discuss the Nu. A month later, Pan Yue, the outspoken vice minister of the environmental agency, organized China's first ""Green Forum,"" a public relations event that included Chinese music and film stars.

One person at the forum was a woman named Wang Yongchen, a member of Green Earth Volunteers, an environmental NGO in Beijing. Initially, the Green Earth Volunteers had concentrated on tree planting and teaching children about the environment. But in recent years, the group had participated in efforts to stop a dam proposal in Sichuan Province.

At the forum, Ms. Wang persuaded 62 celebrities and film stars to sign a petition in support of ""natural"" rivers. She would later donate money to build 30 libraries in poor villages along the Nu.

By early 2004, the controversy had attracted worldwide interest as 60 international organizations agreed to lobby the Chinese government about the Nu. Hundreds of volunteers in China called Unesco to protest the dam proposal. The country's most prominent NGO, Friends of Nature, embraced the cause, while an environmental group in Sichuan collected more than 10,000 signatures to stop the project.

But the crucial factor was the Sept. 1 law. As the project appeared to be nearing approval, biologists, academics and environmentalists all argued that the government had not properly conducted an environmental review.

In late winter, as Ms. Wang guided a tour of Chinese journalists, her cellphone rang. A friend informed her that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao had temporarily suspended the project so that it could be ""carefully discussed and decided on scientifically.""

Ms. Wang began to cry with joy. Later, some Chinese newspapers speculated that Mr. Wen's edict meant that the project was dead.

Mr. Yu thought otherwise.

""I thought this was the first success of public participation,"" he said. ""But I did not think the decision was final.""

Opening a Closed Process
Located a short drive from the city of Liuku, Xiaoshaba is like countless poor villages along the Nu. Peasants live in crude homes, some under the same roof as their livestock and chickens. Some villagers have never gone farther than Liuku; some have never left the village. But on a May afternoon in 2004, a bus arrived. Inside was Yu Xiaogang, and he wanted to take villagers on a trip.

The prime minister's order to suspend the project had stunned developers and provincial officials. A delegation had hurried to Beijing to try to restart the process. At the same time, the government's environmental agency focused on the assessment review.

Mr. Yu was anxious to get villagers involved because the law had highlighted public participation. Most villagers knew nothing about the project or how it would change their lives.

""I thought we must let the Nu River people have their voice,"" Mr. Yu said.

So he offered to take a small group of villagers to the site of the Manwan Dam on the upper reaches of Mekong River in the southern Yunnan. In 2002, Mr. Yu had written an assessment of the social costs of the Manwan project, a report later endorsed by the prime minister at the time, Zhu Rongji. Leaving from Xiaoshaba, Mr. Yu took 14 peasants on a daylong journey to the Manwan, where they found many people living as scavengers.

""They heard how the government made promises but didn't follow through,"" Mr. Yu said. ""Ten years later, nobody cared about them. The Nu River people were shocked.""

Mr. Yu later led a small group of peasants to a Beijing hydropower conference jointly sponsored by the United Nations and China's National Development and Reform Commission. As several speakers extolled the virtues of dams, the dusty group of peasants sat in the upper reaches of the auditorium. Mr. Yu was allowed to speak at a sub-session of the conference. The villagers had practiced giving speeches but were not granted a speaking slot.

Meanwhile, momentum seemed to be shifting in favor of dam supporters. Prime Minister Wen had visited Yunnan to confer with provincial officials. Two prominent scholars toured the Nu -- on a trip sponsored by dam developers -- and attracted wide public attention by attacking the environmentalists.

But that criticism was insignificant compared to a broader governmental crackdown under way against nongovernmental organizations.

In the spring of this year, President Hu ordered an intensive examination of NGO's because of concerns of the role that environmental groups had played in helping to topple governments in Central Asia. In a secret speech to top officials, Mr. Hu warned that the United States was using such groups to try to foment social unrest.

Before, NGO's had hoped that onerous licensing restrictions were about to be repealed. Instead, environmental groups and other NGO's across the country were closely scrutinized, with some losing their licenses. Some groups began to fear that the ""legal space"" granted to the civil society would be tightened, or closed.

In Yunnan, officials began to pressure opponents. Mr. Yu would not comment about whether he had come under pressure. But acquaintances say he that has been forbidden from traveling to international conferences and that officials have put pressure on him.

In Beijing, the environmental assessment report was finished by this summer. But the Ministry of Water Resources, noting that government reports about international rivers were considered proprietary information, declared a small section of the assessment to be a state secret and forbade its release.

Dam opponents said the section could remain secret but argued that publicizing the rest of the report was essential for public discussion of the project. The government still had not outlined the potential environmental risks or explained what would happen to relocated villagers.

So on Aug. 31, opponents mailed a letter to the State Council and later posted it on the Internet. It cited Chinese law and said any decision without public participation ""lacks public support and cannot tolerate history's scrutiny.""

Nearly four months later, the government had not responded.

An Uncertain Future
A traffic sign on the narrow, unpaved road that passes through Xiaoshaba carries a propaganda message: ""A Model Village for Democratic Rule of Law."" A short walk away, beside the concrete block marking the proposed first dam, Guan Fulin, 55, said she had spoken to the surveyors who measured the village land in early December.

""The officials told us it is definitely going to happen,"" Mrs. Guan said. She trusted that the government would take care of her but admitted that she did not yet know how she would be compensated or where she would go. Pointing to the village, she said, ""All these people will be moving.""

If so, it would likely signal the start of a hydropower gold rush in Yunnan Province. One study estimated that China might build enough new dams, most of them in Yunnan, to double its hydroelectric output in the next five years. One plan would inundate one of the most popular tourist attractions in China -- Tiger Leaping Gorge.

Part of the frenzied hydropower development is driven by the thirst for new energy supplies. But part of it is caused by the breakup of the state monopoly that once controlled electrical generation in China. That breakup left regional state-owned energy giants who were each assigned ""assets"" -- like rivers or coal deposits. Each faces competitive pressures to develop new power plants quickly in order to claim market share.

Mr. Ma, the environmental consultant in Beijing, said environmentalists understood that China faced a complex challenge in developing new energy sources even as it must reduce pollution. But he said this intense pressure to develop was why laws that provide oversight and public review must serve as safeguards.

""Before the Nu River proposal, you would hear about opposition to certain projects,"" Mr. Ma said. ""But it was all based on the tremendous courage of individuals. This time, we see progress in Chinese law that makes it possible for a more systemic challenge.""

He added: ""There is now more awareness of environmental rights and the rights of people as citizens. For such a major problem, they believe they have the right to know about it and at least have their views heard.""

The dispute over the Nu seems at a standstill. Ultimately, the decision on holding hearings may fall to the prime minister. Earlier this year, Unesco issued a statement expressing its ""gravest concerns"" about the potential damage to the World Heritage Site. In October, environmentalists boycotted a dam conference linked to the National Reform and Development Commission. Organizers had promised to show parts of the assessment report, but environmentalists believed it was an effort to avoid full public hearings.

Ms. Wang, of the NGO Green Earth Volunteers, described the dilemma in simple terms.

""If the law is not enforced, what shall we do?"" she asked. ""We have this law. Why doesn't this law work?"""
127,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice," The peasants surrounded the clerk in the busy court anteroom, badgering him to let them sue the officials who had seized their land.

No, no, the clerk said, shaking his head and waving his hands, as the peasants recalled it. They were wasting his time and theirs. But as they withdrew, their legal papers remained on his desk in plain sight. Maybe, the peasants hoped, that meant the clerk had tacitly accepted their application to sue.

""In two years of trying every option under the law, this was a moment of optimism,"" said Li Huitang, a leader of peasant resistance in Shiqiao, a village in Hebei Province, in northern China. ""We hoped he might rule on our request.""

Even a written rejection would have been a bonanza, enabling them to appeal to a higher court. But it was not to be. The clerk soon called Mr. Li's home, ordering him to retrieve the documents. When Mr. Li declined, the clerk mailed them back in a plain manila envelope, unmarked, unprocessed and officially ignored.

China's legal system often hands down verdicts that the powerless consider unfair. But a bigger problem is that courts often refuse to issue any verdict at all -- or even acknowledge that some bothersome legal complaints exist.

The English translation is simply ""put on the record"" or ""register a case,"" but in China ""li'an"" is so fraught with official meddling that for many with complaints against the government, the judicial system is closed for business.

Since Communist China first created the semblance of a modern legal system a quarter-century ago, criminal cases -- the state suing individuals -- mostly go through the courts. Private citizens and businesses now often resolve civil disputes in court. But the third and most sensitive use of the judicial system, a 1989 statute that entitles people to sue the state, remains a beguiling fiction, scholars say.

""The number of people wanting to sue the government is large and growing,"" says Xiao Jianguo, a legal scholar at People's University in Beijing who has studied the issue. ""But the number of people who succeed in filing cases against the government is miniscule. So you could say there is a gap between theory and practice.""

Though fast-rising China wants to persuade the outside world that it is governed by law, pressure to improve the system comes mainly from within. Protests are erupting around the country over land seizures, pollution, corruption and abuse of power, with 74,000 officially recorded incidents of mass unrest in 2004.

China's leaders know they need to manage such unrest. Indeed, President Hu Jintao says ""democratic rule of law"" is a crucial ingredient of his plan to build a ""harmonious society.""

Such pledges spread awareness of legal rights, but have yet to change legal procedures. It is not clear how many protests follow failed attempts to settle disputes in court. But lawyers say the judicial system bars its doors to so many contentious cases that it effectively forces people to take to the streets.

That is what happened here in Shiqiao, where residents protesting the loss of prime farmland for a government-backed road, office and residential development tried suing to protect their land-use rights.

They met Kafkaesque obstacles at every turn. The only party that used the courts successfully was the state-linked construction company. It won an injunction in March declaring peasants' protests illegal.

Every Man for Himself
On the scale of land deals in China today, where hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland are converted each year into factories, shopping malls and housing, Shiqiao's 33 acres are just a tiny window box along the bank of the muddy Fuyang River in southern Hebei Province.

Yet the dark, fertile soil and good irrigation made it prime land for growing vegetables. Scores of families depended on small plots there to earn a steady income selling cabbages, cucumbers and beans to city dwellers nearby.

That was true until early 2004, just before spring planting, when the Fengfengkuang district of Hebei instructed peasants in Shiqiao to stay off their land. The Binhai Construction Company, linked to the district's construction bureau, was to build a road and housing there to ""raise the city's status."" Farmers who lost land would be compensated according to the National Land Management Law, a government notice said.

For villagers, it was a call to arms. Peasants cannot own their land outright. Their land-use contracts remain firmly under the government's thumb, nominally to guard against the loss of arable land.

The controls actually provide a perverse incentive for local officials to seize and develop as much farmland as possible. Farmers need only be compensated for lost farm income, generally far below soaring real estate market values. Government-linked middlemen can make a fortune.

""It's every man for himself,"" says Li Yonglu, a 64-year-old resident who has taken part in the campaign against the Fengfengkuang district government. ""You get what you fight for, and no more.""

Officials in Fengfengkuang did not respond to requests to talk about the matter. But in official documents and propaganda posters, they said that the development of Shiqiao's land met all local and national requirements and that peasants were compensated fairly.

The district did offer compensation, from $2,500 to $5,000 a mu, a sixth of an acre. But local rumors had it that the market value exceeded $35,000 a mu and that government agents were pocketing the difference.

Some villagers took the money. Others refused to cooperate. Mr. Li, who wears a French-style beret and once served as the leader of a collective farming brigade in Shiqiao, spurred opposition. He was joined by Li Huitang, a heavyset, gregarious man of 45. They share a family name but are not directly related.

The two men filmed a short documentary praising their ancient alluvial soil. A narrator, speaking in a deep baritone, recited central government policies to prevent the loss of farmland.

Beijing seemed like a possible ally. In the spring of 2004, the National People's Congress, the party-controlled legislature, passed China's first property rights law. Newspapers and television broadcasts heralded the leadership's commitment to govern ""according to law."" In Shiqiao, the principles seemed abstract, but potent.

The local activists read national land laws and concluded that the laws protected their land-use contracts. The local government could not cancel those contracts against their will, they said.

They decided to sue. An attorney in a neighboring city drafted the lawsuit. The two Mr. Lis brought it to Fengfengkuang's court. A clerk read their application, then disappeared for consultations. When he returned, he said the court would take the case, but only if they paid a filing fee of $2,300.

The fee, several times their annual per capita income, seemed intended to scare them away. And in fact many villagers scoffed at paying even a small share. But the Lis rallied 11 families to join them. By the summer of 2004, they had the money. The case was established.

That proved to be the low hurdle. Months passed with no trial date. They demanded explanations. Finally, early this year, they were granted an audience with Chen Xiuying, the top local court official.

Ms. Chen, according to Li Huitang and two others who attended the meeting, struck a sympathetic tone. The court would like to see the case go to trial, but the matter was unfortunately too sensitive.

""She told us the court did not have the power to challenge the government,"" Li Huitang said. ""It might be better for everyone if we withdrew the case. She said if we did, she would refund the fee.""

Ms. Chen, reached in her court office, hung up the phone when asked about the exchange. Her phone was later answered by someone else, who said Ms. Chen had left town on business.

Mr. Li said he declined to withdraw: ""I told her the law is either a tool that can be used by the people, or it isn't. You can't offer it and then take it away.""

Street Justice
Binhai Construction did not wait on the courts. It laid a broad new road, paved in concrete, through Shiqiao's old vegetable plots. Other sections were cordoned off by a high wall, decorated with billboards that show a river flowing through rich fall foliage. Behind the wall, high-rise residences sprouted.

Frustrated by the court setback, the two Mr. Lis began a campaign of civil disobedience. They planted themselves in front of bulldozers, harassed workers and generally disrupted construction.

On March 18, Binhai filed its own civil lawsuit naming Li Yonglu as a defendant, seeking an injunction against his interference. Four days later, the court issued a peremptory ruling without trial. Li Yonglu's actions were declared illegal.

Local officials distributed copies of the ruling to every resident in Shiqiao, villagers said. A party boss read the text of the decision over the village's loudspeakers.

It did not stop the Lis. They and other villagers said they were outraged that the court acted so quickly after suppressing their own suit.

""I discovered that the law is what they say,"" Li Yonglu said. ""What they practice is power.""

On March 25, Fengfengkuang dispatched the local police and paramilitary troops to stop the interference. The deployment brought hundreds of villagers from their homes. A tense standoff turned into a minor riot when the police confiscated cameras some local residents were using to record the event, participants said.

Li Huitang's younger brother said he suffered a gash in his forehead when police officers ripped his camera off his neck. An elderly man fell and was trampled, photographs show.

Villagers turned unruly and began smashing windows and trying to overturn police cars. Fifteen local residents went to jail; three remain behind bars nine months later, relatives said.

Such conflagrations have become a fixture of rural life in boom-time China. Many go unnoticed or face reporting bans in the national news media.

But shortly after the Shiqiao protest, in nearby Dingzhou City, a government effort to quell a land protest captured attention all over China. Hundreds of hired thugs armed with hunting rifles and clubs forced villagers to give up land for a power station. Six farmers died and dozens were injured in a bloody crackdown captured by a farmer's video camera.

For Beijing, that went too far. The Communist Party boss in Dingzhou and 26 others went on trial for the killings in early December.

China's top judge, Xiao Yang, also inspected Hebei's courts following the Dingzhou incident. He told state news outlets that the courts too often treated important cases as ""hot potatoes"" better left untouched, marginalizing the judicial system. ""If the courts bow to the government every time, the people will have no faith in the judicial process,"" he warned.

Neither Yes Nor No
Those sentiments seem to be widely held among officials at the top. There is little evidence, however, that Hebei heeded his warning, at least when cases threatening strong local interests came before the courts.

The two Mr. Lis gave the law another try. This time they found a prominent Beijing-based attorney, Zhou Shifeng, who often pursues difficult cases against the authorities.

After an investigation, Mr. Zhou concluded that the Binhai project violated national land laws, which require State Council approval to develop prime farmland. They could sue Hebei Province for allowing the project to proceed, he said.

Mr. Zhou had low expectations. China's administrative law stipulates that cases against a local government must be filed first in its jurisdiction, where local party bosses hold sway. It can be appealed, but only after the local court rules or rejects the case.

Courts legally must issue written rejection notices if they choose not take the case. But to avoid appeals, court clerks often decline to take possession of legal papers. No rejection notice is needed if the case does not, in China's political-legal cosmos, formally exist.

""The law is absurd,"" Mr. Zhou said. ""But it is the only way.""

In September Mr. Zhou, the two Mr. Lis and other villagers gathered at court in Shijiazhuang, Hebei's provincial capital. Qian Rendong, a court clerk, received them.

They pleaded their case: they had legal right to sue; local officials had violated national land laws; their hope of obtaining justice depended on him.

Mr. Qian, they said, was polite, but stubborn. He browsed through their papers and asked some questions, but in the end gave no ground. He urged them to appeal to higher authorities through the petition system rather than the courts.

But whether out of deference or a simple oversight, he did not, as their session ended, hand back their documents. Technically, it seemed, he had accepted their application to sue.

""We talked excitedly among ourselves as we left the court,"" Li Yonglu said. ""It seemed like a first step.""

Two days later, Mr. Qian called Mr. Li's home. The papers must be collected immediately or he could not guarantee their safety. The case would not be registered and there would be no rejection notice, either.

Mr. Zhou advised Mr. Li to stay home. They would press the clerk to reject the case in writing. Mr. Li said he was nervous -- original documents he had spent months compiling were in the clerk's possession -- but he held back.

The risk, though, was not that the documents would be destroyed, but rather that they would be disregarded. Two weeks later they arrived by mail, incognito, at Mr. Zhou's office in Beijing.

In Shiqiao's land case, it was the only verdict the court would render."
128,NYT,Kahn,2006,China Justice,"From the prison cell where he contemplated an executioner's bullet, a migrant worker named Wang Binyu gave an anguished account of his wasted life. Unexpectedly, it rippled across China like a primal scream.

For three weeks, the brutal murders Mr. Wang committed after failing to collect unpaid wages were weighed on the Internet and in Chinese newspapers against the brutal treatment he had endured as a migrant worker. Public opinion shouted for mercy; lawyers debated the fairness of his death sentence. Others saw the case as a bloody symptom of the harsh inequities of Chinese life.

But then, in late September, the furor disappeared as suddenly as it had begun. Online discussion was censored and news media coverage was almost completely banned. Mr. Wang's final appeal was rushed to court. His father, never notified, learned about the hearing only by accident. His chosen defense lawyer was forbidden from participating.

""All of you are on the same side,"" Mr. Wang, 28, shouted during the hearing, his father said in an interview here in the family's home village in northern Gansu Province. ""If you want to kill me, just kill me.""

On Oct. 19, they did. Mr. Wang was executed so quickly, and quietly, that it took weeks for the word to fully trickle out that he was dead.

China executes more people every year than the rest of the world combined. By some estimates, the number of executions is more than 10,000 a year. The government's relentless death penalty machine has long been its harshest tool for maintaining political control and curbing crime and corruption.

But it has now become a glaring uncertainty about China's commitment to the rule of law. There is widespread suspicion, even within the government, that too many innocent people are sentenced to death. This year, a raft of cases came to light in which wrongful convictions had led to death sentences, or, in one well-publicized case, the execution of an innocent man.

Reforming capital punishment has become a priority within the Communist Party-controlled legal system, partly because of international pressure to reduce abuses. Within the party-run legislative system, there is a broader debate about how to improve criminal law.

But achieving those reforms is hardly certain. Hard-liners are loath to restrict the power of the police and the courts to take a tough line. Death penalty reforms announced by the People's Supreme Court -- and broadly trumpeted in the state news media -- are mostly just a return to the status quo of 1980.

The case of Wang Binyu lacked the moral clarity of an innocent man wrongly convicted. He killed four people in a rampage after a final dispute over wages. But his saga of abuse and disdain from his bosses resonated deeply with a public disgusted with corruption and inequality and resentful of a legal system perceived as favoring the wealthy and well connected.

""Wang was forced to fight against those who exploit and tread on the poor,"" one person wrote at a Chinese Web site. ""Why is the law always tough on the poor?""

Mr. Wang's case also illustrates how a system built for convictions has few safeguards or protections for a defendant facing death. Officials in the High Court of Ningxia Autonomous Region, the area in western China where the case was heard, refused several requests for interviews. But Wu Shaozhi, the Beijing lawyer who tried to represent Mr. Wang, said the Ningxia courts obviously wanted fast results.

Before the appeal, the Wang family signed power of attorney to Mr. Wu. But Mr. Wu said court officials had initially lied, telling him the appeal was over. Then they refused to let him enter the case. Instead, Mr. Wang was represented by a lawyer approved by the court.

Meanwhile, Mr. Wu noted, the same judges who heard the appeal also concurrently handled a mandatory final review of the case. It meant that judges were reviewing their own ruling -- a practice that legal experts said is not uncommon and provided little real check and balance on the use of the death penalty.

""An unjust procedure will undoubtedly lead to unjust results,"" Mr. Wu said.

China is wary enough about its death penalty system that it has long designated its number of executions as a state secret. A hint at the number came last year when a high-level delegate to the National People's Congress publicly estimated that it was ""nearly 10,000."" In 2004, Amnesty International documented at least 3,400 executions -- out of 3,797 worldwide that year -- but cautioned that China's number was probably far higher. Outside scholars have put the annual number as high as 15,000.

In late October, the People's Supreme Court announced that it would reverse a decision from the early 1980's that ceded the final review on many death penalty cases to provincial high courts. Legal analysts say Deng Xiaoping, then the paramount leader, ordered the move out of anger that courts were moving too slowly to crack down on crime. The shift meant that provincial courts could often operate without any oversight.

Under the new policy, the People's Supreme Court will reclaim responsibility for reviewing all capital cases. The state news media have estimated that executions could drop by as much as 30 percent -- an estimate that could not be proved but that implied deep flaws within the current system.

""They feel that mistakes were made in so many cases,"" said Yi Yanyou, an associate professor at Tsinghua University Law School, in explaining the motive for the change. Mr. Yi said the new changes would be meaningful, but did not represent reform, because they merely re-established central control. One idea for a change that he offered was to require unanimous consent among judicial panels making final reviews.

He Weifang, a liberal constitutional scholar at Beijing University, said the new changes should improve the review process, but argued that only deeper constitutional reform, to establish a more independent judiciary, could remove the political pressures that can seep into many high-profile death cases.

Out in the arid hills of southern Gansu where farmers scratch a living from soil that seems as fertile as chalk, Mr. Wang's family is unaware of such legal debates. At age 15, Mr. Wang left home for migrant work after a childhood marred by poverty and tragedy. When he was a young child, his mother died after an infection from a botched sterilization. Family planning officials had ordered the procedure after she gave birth to Mr. Wang's younger brother. The family sued, without success.

Mr. Wang worked at a succession of migrant jobs until he took a job three years ago wrapping steel pipes in the power plant of a factory in Ningxia. His younger brother, Binyin, who also worked at the factory, described the bosses as brutal men who beat Binyu and later mocked him when he became sick with ulcers.

The bosses also withheld Binyu's salary for two years, a problem common to migrant workers. This spring, his father called to say he urgently needed surgery for a leg fracture. The brothers decided to quit and return home. But first they needed to collect more than $1,000 in unpaid wages.

For weeks, Wang Binyu approached the bosses to collect the money. At one point, Wu Hua, a foreman, promised to pay the brothers if they would work a few more weeks. They did so, but still were not paid. ""Once, my brother went to the bosses and began crying and begging them to pay him,"" Wang Binyin said.

Finally this May, the factory boss, Chen Jiwei, relented and paid the 2004 salary, but only after making large deductions for fees and boarding expenses. He then refused to pay the 2005 wages until next year.

Frustrated, Wang Binyu sought help from the local labor bureau, but was told it had no jurisdiction. He went to the courts, but was told a legal case would take months. He then returned to the labor bureau, where a senior official agreed to intervene and persuaded a boss, Wu Xinguo, to pay the back wages within five days. It seemed like a victory.

But after leaving the labor bureau, Wu Xinguo barred the brothers from their dormitory. Later that night, locked out of their room, the brothers began beating on Wu Xinguo's door to demand payment. Wu Hua, the foreman, and others soon arrived and tried to run off the Wang brothers. The group began pushing and slapping Wang Binyu until a fight broke out. Wang Binyu, who was carrying a fruit knife, exploded in a rage that would end with four people dead and one injured.

Wang Binyin said he tried to pull his older brother away. He recalls saying: ""You can't do this. We still have an old father at home. What am I going to do?"" When the rampage ended, Wang Binyu tossed his knife in the Yellow River and turned himself in at a local police station. As it turned out, the two top bosses -- Mr. Chen and Wu Xinguo -- escaped harm.

Mr. Wang's initial trial, on June 29, ended with a death sentence. His family was not notified of the trial date and did not attend. He seemed destined to be one of the thousands of people executed each year with little public notice. But on Sept. 4, the New China News Agency, the government's news service, published a jailhouse interview with Mr. Wang that was astonishing for its content and for the mere fact that it was printed.

""I want to die,"" Mr. Wang said. ""When I am dead, nobody can exploit me anymore. Right?""

Of his crime, Mr. Wang said, ""I just could not take it any longer. I had taken enough from them."" But, he later added, ""I should not have killed the other people. I did not mean to let it happen.""

Finally, he offered a lament for his fellow migrant workers. ""My life is a small thing,"" he said. ""I hope that society will pay attention and respect us.""

Chinese journalists say the authors of the article picked the case because they thought it dovetailed with a campaign by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to help peasants. Newspapers, assuming the interview signaled official approval, jumped on the story.

Interviews with legal scholars followed, with some arguing that the system should be nimble enough to give Mr. Wang a more lenient sentence. Internet discussion boards were filled with indignation.

But the coverage was put to a sudden stop. Internet search engines were ordered to censor Wang Binyu's name, and newspapers were told to drop the story before the appeal was heard in late September. Most likely, the public outrage had alarmed central government officials who did not want to see a death sentence so openly questioned. From his jail cell, Wang Binyu told his younger brother that he thought local officials were eager to execute him, because a reversal of the death sentence could harm their careers.

The appeal was held in secret. Mr. Wang's father, Wang Liding, happened to bring his son a pair of shoes a day earlier. Otherwise, he would not have known. At one point, the father said that he shouted out during the proceeding because prosecutors said his son's wages had been fully paid. The elder Mr. Wang was briefly removed after the outburst.

Now, the family has still not collected the unpaid wages owed the dead son. Donations have helped them build a new room on their crumbling house. The father has wrapped the green booklet certifying his son's cremation in folded paper. It is his last record of his son.

In October, before the execution, court officials in Ningxia called the father with what he thought was good news. He was told he could come collect his son's unpaid salary. He traveled for more than a day to Ningxia from Gansu. But when he arrived, he found that the lure of wages had been a lie. Officials wanted him to sign his son's execution warrant.

Illiterate, the father could only smudge the paper with his thumb.

""It was wrong of him to kill people,"" the father said. ""But there was a cause."""
129,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"Doctors treating a five-year-old boy after a horrific electrical accident this spring were surprised to find another, equally serious problem: dangerously elevated levels of lead in his blood.

The incident uncovered one of China's worst known cases of lead poisoning. For a decade, a factory near Xinsi, an isolated village in the mountains of China's western Gansu province, made lead ingots used in manufacturing color television tubes and cables shipped around the world.

It also poured out poisoned air containing 800 times the permissible level of lead emissions, officials say.

Wang Shuhong didn't know her son, Zhou Hao, was suffering from lead poisoning until an unrelated accident brought him to the hospital.

Nearly everyone from the village who has been tested so far -- including some 250 children from three schools -- has been found with unsafe amounts of lead in their bodies. Ten children remain hospitalized and at least four are likely to have severe brain damage in the village of 1,800 people, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency.

""There's not one person in this village without lead poisoning,"" says Zhou Xiang, whose son was hospitalized with level of 488 micrograms per liter of blood. ""My children's fingers are black and blue.""

The World Health Organization says that lead blood levels of 100 micrograms per liter and above (or 10 micrograms per deciliter, using the measurement standard more common in the U.S.) are cause for concern in children. Studies show even slightly elevated lead levels can lead to permanent neurological damage and reduced IQ.

Clutching their carefully folded lab results and pointing to the numbers -- 304, 488 and even 798 -- the parents of Xinsi say they finally understand why their children have complained for so long of nausea, headaches and pains. They say their babies' teeth are growing black or not coming in at all. Parents and teachers say children are having memory and concentration problems.

The disaster shows how vulnerable China's citizens are to the environmental damage inflicted by the country's rapid industrial growth. The result is a health crisis that could have long-term consequences for a generation of children. Even in wealthier areas of China such as Shanghai and Guangdong province, officials say the deteriorating environment is a factor behind a rise in birth defects.

A lack of pollution controls has contaminated China's soil, water and air with lead, mercury and other pollutants -- and left millions of children with dangerously high levels of toxic metals in their blood. Making matters worse, much of the manufacturing that used to pollute the West has found a ready home in China, where environmental regulations are loosely enforced.

About 34% of children in China have blood-lead levels that exceed the WHO limit, according to a recent report by researchers at Peking University Health Science Center in Beijing, who reviewed 10 years of data on the topic. The situation is considerably worse in factory towns like Xinsi. By comparison, fewer than 1% of children in the U.S. have levels above the WHO limit.

High lead levels are ""very common in my clinic,"" says Yan Chonghuai, a specialist in childhood lead poisoning at Xinhua Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Dr. Yan treats cases from all over the country. On a recent day, the hospital accepted a child from Fujian province with a blood lead level of 700 and another with a level of 500 from exposure to talcum powder contaminated with lead.

In China, lead is still prized in manufacturing because it is plentiful, cheap, malleable, and resistant to corrosion. Lead compounds are regularly added to plastics and vinyl to make them more resistant to high temperatures. Because lead is heavy, it is often added to cheap metal products to make them seem more substantial.

Lead dust is sometimes added to herbal products that are sold by weight to make them heavier and increase their value. If lead is in a stable solution it may not pose a problem. But lead can be particularly dangerous in toys and jewelry because children can swallow it.

China's lead problem is drawing new attention from U.S. regulators. In the past two years, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission has recalled roughly 20 products imported from China because of high lead content. They range from beach umbrellas to portable karaoke machines to children's animal-shaped flashlights.

""Given the nature of the global economy, the manufacturing processes abroad can have a substantial impact on the health of young children in the United States,"" says John F. Rosen, who runs the lead program at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York.

Earlier this year, a 4-year-old Minneapolis boy died of lead poisoning after swallowing a metal charm that came as a gift with a pair of Reebok sneakers. The charm, which was made in China, was 99% lead.

A representative of Reebok International Ltd. says the company takes ""product safety very seriously"" and immediately recalled 500,000 products in 25 countries following the incident. The company has since stepped up oversight of suppliers, and increased testing of products for restricted substances.

China's pollution problems are in some ways reminiscent of what was seen during the rapid industrialization of 19th-century Britain and other industrial revolutions. But China's rapid growth is taking place at a time when government officials are well aware of the dangers of toxic substances like lead.

China is in the early stages of a battle against lead that the U.S. started nearly three decades ago. During the 1960s and early 1970s, hundreds of American children were hospitalized each year with severe lead poisoning linked to exposure from lead in paint and gasoline. One in four hospitalized children died, because there were no treatments at the time. The deaths led to laws banning lead in paint, gasoline and other industrial products. The campaign against lead was part of a wave of environmental legislation passed in the 1970s aimed at reining in rampant industrial pollution.

Now, China is confronting the same ""trade-off between short-term profits by industry and the long-term burden of human and environmental costs,"" says Bruce Lanphear, a professor of environmental health at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

After decades of ignoring the rising environmental toll of its breakneck economic growth, China's central government is now trying to stem the damage. The government has already taken some steps to curb lead exposure such as phasing out leaded gasoline in the late 1990s and passing stricter rules on workplace exposure. Yet central authorities have found their efforts stymied by local officials whose promotions are based on growth in their local economies.

Xinsi, or new temple, seems like an unlikely place for an environmental battlefield. Eight hours by bus from Xi'an, the largest nearby city and home of the famed terra-cotta warriors, Xinsi is a farming village of old mud-walled homes with traditional curved Chinese roofs and wood lattice windows.

The factory, which took lead ore and melted it to separate impurities, was opened 10 years ago by a company called Huixian Hongyu Nonferrous Smelting Co. Ltd. Huixian was owned at the time by a state conglomerate called Gansu Luo Ba Nonferrous Group.

Government officials say the factory's smelter distilled lead ore into 5,000 tons a year of lead ingots and dumped the waste in unsafe slag piles. Some of that output was eventually used in television screens or cables exported to the U.S. and South Korea, according to the parent company's Web site.

The factory lies at the base of a small creek, a stone's throw from the local primary school, and its smokestack dominates the countryside. It is far from any lead-ore deposits or convenient transportation. One local official said the factory was built in Xinsi instead of closer to bigger cities to avoid scrutiny. China's environmental regulators and activists say it's increasingly common for heavily polluting industries to move to the countryside, where supervision is weak.

There are signs that the Xinsi factory followed at least rudimentary safety procedures with its own workers, many of whom came from outside the village. The factory conducted blood tests and dismissed those whose lead levels were elevated. Zhou Fei, a 42-year-old Xinsi resident, lost his job after a failed blood test. His neighbors say he has trouble remembering dates now. Asked directly, Mr. Zhou can't recall when he worked at the factory.

Many Xinsi villagers say they had no idea that the lead dust spewed by the smelter posed a hazard to them. ""We're just simple peasants,"" said Xu Minzheng, whose 2-year-old son has a lead level of 263 micrograms per liter of blood. His 7-year-old daughter has a lead level of 316. He pointed to the smokestack overlooking the rutted dirt path winding past corn and red chili peppers hanging to dry. ""We didn't have any awareness of what lead could do. But the government officials should have known. We just don't have the means to deal with this sort of thing.""

Lead causes brain damage by mimicking helpful metals found naturally in the body, such as calcium, iron and zinc, and binding with the same molecules and proteins. Calcium, for example, is essential for brain development because it facilitates the growth of nerve cells. But lead binds with the sites in the brain that were intended for calcium, disrupting brain circuits critical for learning, and sometimes impeding cell growth. The process leads to irreversible intellectual impairment. Lead exposure is especially harmful to children.

Last year, the Xinsi smelter's parent company, the Gansu Luo Ba Nonferrous Group, went private in a management buyout. The factory upgraded its emissions controls, but turned them off at night, when the factory would emit heavy smoke, to save money, villagers said. Earlier this year, government authorities told the factory to cease operating, but it continued to produce in secret, according to the villagers and Xinhua, China's official state-run news agency.

The situation might have continued unchanged if it weren't for a little boy's curiosity back in March. Five-year-old Zhou Hao was playing with a classmate near a slag heap from another factory in their hamlet. Hopping over an unfinished wall, the boy touched a big electric transformer. The massive shock blew off his shoes and knocked him unconscious.

The boy's parents rode with their badly injured son overnight in an ambulance to the nearest big city hospital, in Xi'an, for the first of many operations to save his life. His left arm was amputated, he needed skin grafts, and his badly gashed scalp swelled like a balloon.

It was after blood transfusions for one of these operations that doctors diagnosed Zhou Hao's incredibly high levels of lead. The doctors couldn't understand why farmers would have lead in their blood, until Hao's mother, Wang Shuhong, told them about the factory.

Ms. Wang said she and her husband, uneducated farmers, didn't realize the consequences of the high lead level and quickly forgot about the doctors' diagnosis. Taking turns sleeping and keeping watch over their son at the hospital and worrying about how to raise tens of thousands of yuan for his medical bills left the parents drained and exhausted.

It took another chance encounter -- this time with a worker in the Xinsi smelter they bumped into in Xi'an -- for them to learn about lead. They asked what pills they should take to get rid of the lead. He said pills wouldn't help their child.

By August, after five months of treatment, Zhou Hao's parents brought him home. Word began to spread about the young boy's lead poisoning. A few farmers began sending their children to be tested in Xi'an. But officials in the factory and government denied the lead poisoning had anything to do with them, Zhou Hao's mother and other villagers said.

Zhou Hao has lead levels that, due to blood transfusions, have swung between 262 and 557, his parents say. The factory owners ""did this for their profit,"" says Ms. Wang. ""They didn't even think about lives at all.""

Officials only started taking the allegations seriously after a local newspaper in Xi'an reported Sept. 5 about all the villagers coming in for lead tests. That story was soon picked up by Xinhua, which as the official organ of the regime nationalized the story and brought it to the attention of China's central leadership.

A government investigative team from Beijing is looking into how local and provincial officials allowed the factory to keep operating for years despite its failure to meet national emissions standards.

The factory has closed and parts have been torn down, villagers say. ""Our stance is very clear: If we should be found responsible for this, we will admit it and actively take responsibility. It would be impossible for us to avoid responsibility,"" said Liu Xiaodong, office manager at Gansu Lou Ba Nonferrous Group. The local and provincial governments declined comment pending the conclusion of an investigation.

It is highly unusual in China for a company to make reparations for environmental damage. Occasionally a polluter will be forced to pay farmers for damage to crops. But there is no developed law for establishing liability for health problems.

On a recent day, a shiny caravan of sport utility vehicles carrying a delegation of regional officials roared through the rutted mu lanes to meet with the villagers. Many of the villagers gathered in an angry crowd. The officials agreed to distribute pills to people suffering severe lead poisoning. One type of pill was a Chinese herbal remedy.

International health agencies say there's no effective treatment for lead exposure except in the most life-threatening cases, when patients can be given drugs called chelation agents that strip heavy metals out of the body. But the drugs cannot reverse brain damage that has already occurred, and they carry risks of their own because they also strip useful metals from the body, such as iron and zinc.

Wu Wenchou, a bright-eyed 15-year-old girl, is one of those who was poisoned. Ms. Wu speaks standardized Mandarin -- a clear mark of an education in a rural county where the local dialect dominates. ""I used to dream of going abroad to study, maybe even America,"" she said quietly, barely holding back tears. ""My dream has been shattered.""

Once a class star, young Ms. Wu began having difficulty concentrating on her homework, and her test scores kept falling. Her once-proud mother shouted at her as her grades dropped. Her blood has lead levels of 261 -- more than double the standards for safety. She called her older sister, who is studying at a nearby medical school, and told her to come home for the lead tests, too.

""I'm afraid. We have no choice,"" she shrugged. ""These are the facts, this is reality."""
130,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"About a mile from Tiananmen Square lies a pit from which a 28-story hotel will rise in a little more than a year. An army of construction workers lives and works at the open site, enduring plunging temperatures and freezing winds. 

Some work the midnight hours, while the rest of the city sleeps. 

Others rise at dawn. They work 15-hour days or longer, seven days a week. When they topple onto their bunk beds, it is 12 to a room. There is no heat. 

One of them is Wei Zhongwen. He has more than two decades as a construction worker, and the injuries to prove it: a missing pinkie and a palm-size dent on his head under his neatly cropped hair. In the past decade, the 41-year-old has helped build skyscrapers, shopping malls and much else in Beijing and nearby provinces. He hasn't seen his wife or daughter in two years, and because of the press of work ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008, he may not see them this year either. 

Migrant construction workers try to go home every year for Chinese New Year. But in the meantime, they use call centers like this one to contact their families. 

""For me, one of the biggest problems of this job is loneliness,"" says Mr. Wei, puffing on a cigarette. 

In his rural hometown, the money Mr. Wei has sent back has built his extended family a five-room house with a thatch roof, a 21-inch color television set and rooms housing a horse and some pigs. The hardship of his work is worth it, Mr. Wei says, to educate his daughter and sustain his family on their farm.

Beijing is in the midst of an enormous building boom -- one of the most ambitious construction projects the world has ever seen. Cranes clutter its skyline. At more than 10,000 sites across the city, there is a total of 1.7 billion square feet of floor space under construction -- an area that, if laid out, would be nearly three times the size of Manhattan. 

This colossal development is due to the efforts of a nearly invisible army, a group of almost two million migrant workers who drift from China's farmlands. Toting their bedrolls from work site to work site, they earn as little as 50 cents an hour. They work in a hazardous profession with practically no workplace protections and little or no medical coverage. Many of the workers live right in the heart of the city, yet few ordinary Beijing residents ever glimpse their crowded barracks, where privacy, cleanliness -- even meat -- are luxuries. 

They often get paid late or not at all. A report this year by the research arm of the State Council, China's highest administrative body, found that in 2004, construction firms in Beijing owed roughly 700,000 of their workers more than $380 million in wages. Mr. Wei is fighting to collect about $400 he says he is owed -- half his earnings last year -- and he may never see it. 

In such an uncertain environment, workers drift from job to job together. They rely on word of mouth to protect themselves against bad bosses. And, in bad times, they rely on each other. 

These men -- there are few women in their crews -- are working against a deadline: December 2007. That is when the bulk of the Olympic construction work must be completed so that Beijing, one of the world's most polluted cities, has time for the air to clear of construction dust before the Games begin. 

There is a lot to finish. The Olympics will attract a flood of foreign visitors and unprecedented media attention. Beijing's construction workers are aiming to have built a chunk of a subway system that, when completed, is projected to be the longest in the world, surpassing London's underground. They are erecting an airport terminal bigger than all five at London's Heathrow Airport and about 110 hotels. Including the suburbs of Beijing, the building binge could cost more than $180 billion. Some call it China's most ambitious construction project since the Great Wall. 

What happens to these workers after the boom already has become a topic of controversy. Beijing officials have made it clear they want to clear them out ahead of the Olympics. But authorities also fear political instability if so many workers are forced to leave because they may have trouble finding jobs back home.

As it is, the construction workers have a tenuous standing in the city. Lacking the papers to stay in Beijing legally, most work off the books, relying on oral promises instead of contracts. When they are sick, they visit illegal clinics, which are cheap but often dirty and run by unlicensed doctors. 

Mr. Wei speaks proudly of his 18-year-old daughter Xiaowei, who lives with the rest of his family on a farm in Yushu county, in northeastern Jilin province. He says the girl is a good student and obedient. ""We're not that close. I don't know what she likes,"" he says, awkwardly fingering a bunch of keys on his belt. A badge of prosperity among middle-age Chinese men, Mr. Wei's keys are a small vanity. He says he picked them up on the street. They are keys to things he doesn't have: a car, an apartment. 

Like other construction workers, he lives frugally in the city. In his latest job he earns about $300 or so a month, but keeps only about $60 of it. The rest he sends home to the ""3861 army"" -- a term used to describe the women and children left behind in China's interior. (March 8 is China's Women's Day, June 1 Children's Day.) 

Next to coal mining, construction work has the highest number of casualties in China, with 2,607 reported fatalities in 2005. Steel-tipped boots are rare. China's workers clamber around in thin canvas shoes, often without safety harnesses, and buy their own work gloves. Many of their hard hats are just thin plastic shells, sold for a dollar apiece.

Wang Qishan, the mayor of Beijing, said in a recent interview that he personally reviews construction accident statistics daily. ""I can never be happy when I read such reports,"" he said. ""Beijing can't do without these people."" The city tries to provide services such as health care for registered migrant workers, but its resources are overstretched, he said.

Like many other construction workers, Mr. Wei entered the trade because there was little else to do on his family's farm, a small plot where corn and soybeans grow. He left home at 17 for a province next to Beijing. 

When he was in his 20s, Mr. Wei's left little finger was sliced off by an electric saw. In 1994, he was hit on the head by a steel rod, landing him in the hospital for more than a month. He counts himself lucky because his employer paid for his medical bills. Construction is under way at more than 10,000 sites in Beijing.  

Last year, the owner of an art gallery in Tongzhou, a Beijing suburb, stiffed Mr. Wei and 76 crew mates, according to the men and a later court ruling. They had been paid halfway through the project and promised the rest of the pay upon completion. Instead, when they finished they say they were driven from the site by thugs armed with iron staffs and meat cleavers. 

China's state-controlled banks have poured credit into real estate, where many companies are politically connected. The easy money often leads to ill-conceived projects that quickly go bust. When financing collapses, construction workers -- the ones at the bottom of the totem pole -- aren't paid. They find it difficult to claim restitution because they often are employed indirectly through subcontractors. 

Mr. Wei and his friends say they had no success appealing to authorities in Tongzhou. About 20 of the workers drifted home, defeated. With no money, Mr. Wei and the remaining workers were forced to make camp in the neighboring province of Hebei, eking out a living with odd jobs. They say they lived on steamed buns, mostly, six for one yuan, or about 13 cents. 

In November 2005, more than 50 of them rose at dawn. They marched for five hours to central Beijing to appeal to authorities there. They wound up at Beijing's Legal Aid office on Qianmen West Street.Wang Xuefa, the center's director, remembers the sight of Mr. Wei and his friends kneeling en masse on the office floor. ""It was sad to see men brought so low,"" he says.

The Intermediate People's Court in Tongzhou ruled in the group's favor on Jan. 6, ordering the Hong Kong developer Lian Ka Fu International to pay more than $30,000 in back wages to the workers. They haven't seen a cent. Lian Ka Fu's proprietor, Wang Xiaohu, told the court she doesn't have the money, says Chang Mingchuan, a lawyer at Beijing Legal Aid. Ms. Wang couldn't be reached for comment, and her Europe American Art Gallery -- a green low-rise with gold Corinthian columns -- is now shuttered.

Going home for Chinese New Year, China's most important holiday, is a ritual for construction workers. It is the only time in the year they see their families. Like returning heroes, they are feted and tell tales of car-choked streets and the towering skyscrapers they helped build. ""Some of my neighbors have not even taken a train,"" Mr. Wei says.

Back home, Mr. Wei is a man of substance. Over the years, his wages, which are higher than average among construction workers because of his bricklaying expertise, have helped his family enjoy some comforts. ""We're very well respected in my home,"" he says.

Last January, however, Mr. Wei stayed in a Hebei flophouse instead of returning home for the new year holiday. Penniless, he and his friends were too ashamed to go. To cheer up, they went to an airfield and watched planes taking off.

""Really, that's the only time I felt like suicide. I thought if a car hit me, at least I can get some compensation,"" Mr. Wei says.

Reached by telephone, his wife, Ding Guiying, says it is a hard life taking care of Mr. Wei's aged parents, raising her daughter alone and tending the crops. Mr. Wei's wages nowadays go to pay for his daughter's secondary education -- which isn't free in China, even at public schools. Ms. Ding says the bill comes to around $1,300 a year.

Ms. Ding, 42, hopes her husband can come home when their daughter has finished school. ""We keep being separated for such a long time, and I can hardly count how many days we've been together in the past 19 years,"" she says.

Mr. Wei spent most of this year in Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing. In May, he and his friends found a job at a residential site. Mr. Wei roomed in a wooden shack with 10 other workers. The floor was a brick-and-dirt mixture. The only running water was from a sink in the courtyard. The toilet was a shed with wooden planks over a hole. In the kitchen, flies clustered thickly.

In Hebei, as is common on such jobs, Mr. Wei paid his employer about 60 cents daily for three meals, mostly rice and tofu. Meat was rare, but he is a vegetarian. Growing up poor, he never got used to the taste of meat.

One of the crew, Yang Xinguo, 53, injured his leg in a traffic accident and had to stop working in September. After lingering for a while, hoping to get compensation from the art-gallery job, he decided to go home in mid-November. He had a few dollars earned before the accident and $50 or so that Mr. Wei and other friends gave him.

""We will send your pay to you, once we get it,"" promised Mr. Wei, sitting on Mr. Yang's bed. He offered his departing friend a cigarette. Through the smoke, Mr. Yang's eyes shimmered. ""Men don't want to cry, but we have cried many times,"" he said.

By late November, Mr. Wei and his crew had moved back to Beijing. They found better work building the 28-story, four-star hotel. Conditions are cleaner. Mr. Wei now lives in barracks perched next to the yawning site. He has 10 roommates, including some new ones. There is no canteen, so they cook in the room, using a gas ring attached to a five-foot canister next to Mr. Wei's bed.

With no heating, they sleep in their jackets, and sometimes hats and gloves, too. Temperatures can drop below zero Fahrenheit in Beijing's winter. Some have electric blankets they bought for about $1.25 each.

They are creative with their limited space, rolling back their bedrolls and using the boards beneath as makeshift tables. The cook, Wen Fenglin, adroitly uses the space to chop cabbages and peel onions, ladling water from an old paint bucket to clean the food and utensils. The 55-year-old used to work on the crew but now is employed by the construction company to cook. ""Boss said I have to learn because I'm too old to do heavy work,"" he says, browning onions for an omelet.

There are no washing facilities, so baths and clean clothes are treats. Mr. Wei remembers taking a bath well more than a month ago at a bathhouse, paying about 60 cents.

With no laundry, Mr. Wei buys secondhand clothes, wearing them until they get too dirty. Currently, his favorite is a gray cotton shirt he bought for a little more than a dollar, which looks as if it once might have belonged to a corporate executive. ""I normally throw away the clothes after wearing, but maybe I'll sell this. In about 10 days,"" he says.

Around Beijing's small alleyways, an underground economy caters to construction workers. Vendors often do their business by barter because the workers don't have space to keep much and adopt a throwaway culture. One popular item is underwear with zippered pockets, to keep money and valuables close.

Mr. Wei's pace of work is now frenetic. The hotel still is just a big hole in the ground. Under city ordinances, concrete trucks from the hundreds of factories ringing the city are allowed in the city center only after 11 p.m. and on weekends, so he and his friends must work long past midnight curing concrete. Once the hotel's foundation is done, in about two months, Mr. Wei says the plan is to build a floor every five days.

On the next-to-last day of November, Mr. Wei and his comrades crowded into a small postal outlet, their grimy appearance setting them apart from other customers. The air smelled of unwashed clothes, and some people edged away.

It was exactly a year since they had made their long march to the Beijing Legal Aid office. Mr. Wei had given up hope of recovering his lost wages, but on this day the mood was celebratory. It was payday, and the men wanted to mail their money home. There was a flurry of bewilderment as they fumbled with forms. Mr. Wei, his eyes red-rimmed after a 24-hour shift, helped some of the workers who can't write well fill out the forms.

Zhang Tao, 20, in a paint-stained blue sweater and matted hair, slowly scrawled the amount he is sending home: 900 yuan, or about $115. He said he earns 1,000 yuan, or $128, a month.

On another night, Mr. Wei took a walk, wandering around the city's glittering towers and looming cranes. ""I have no regrets,"" he said. ""I'm the migrant worker who stays out all year so home is better. I've seen things my neighbors have never imagined -- 50-story buildings, planes so big they can carry hundreds.""

He stopped in front of a European five-star hotel near his work site. ""I build these things, but I have never been inside,"" he said.

Timidly, he pushed the swing door and went in."
131,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"Nearly 1,000 new cars hit the streets here every day, crowding a city already choked with pollution. Levels of nitrogen dioxide currently exceed the World Health Organization's clean-air guidelines by 78%.

The mayor, Wang Qishan, complains that the number of cars flooding the roads makes it ""more difficult to run the city."" Local officials are so worried about air quality for the 2008 summer Olympic Games that they are considering a temporary ban on private cars.

At the same time, the city owns Beijing Automotive Industry Corp., a car maker that has joint ventures with DaimlerChrysler AG and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. Last year, the company and its affiliates made more than 500,000 cars, trucks and buses, employed 48,000 workers and paid more than $500 million in local taxes. By 2008, they expect to produce one million vehicles a year.

After various on-and-off restrictions, Beijing, which has more vehicles than any other Chinese city, has almost no limitations on car usage.

""This is something of great difficulty for us. The contradiction of population and the environment -- for us and the whole of China,"" said Mr. Wang at a March meeting.

The rise of the automobile highlights the wrenching balancing act China faces as it tries to join the ranks of modern consumer societies: improving living standards and creating jobs for the country's 1.3 billion people while keeping pollution and oil demand under control.

Officials from China's central government are divided over how to proceed. The country's powerful economic planners see the auto industry as a ""pillar"" of the national economy. Others, including those from the State Environmental Protection Administration, argue that China needs to limit car use and move more quickly to tighten clean-air rules.

Local leaders are also torn. Many city and provincial governments, like Beijing, have a financial stake in the industry and are eager to capitalize on ramped-up production. But they also face complaints from citizens about snarled traffic and dirty air.

China's car debate stands out because its population is the planet's largest. Across the country, rising incomes and falling auto prices have led to an explosion in car sales, up 54% in the first three months of 2006, compared with the year-earlier period. China's auto market is now the world's second biggest, and the motor-vehicle industry employs 1.7 million workers.

The shift is happening so quickly that McDonald's Corp. said last week that it expects at least half of its new outlets in China to be drive-throughs.

And the car craze here has just begun. China now has about 25 vehicles -- and fewer than seven cars -- for every thousand people, roughly the same level as the U.S. had in 1915. If auto sales continue apace, there will be more than 130 million vehicles on China's roads by 2020 -- up from about 33 million today. That could help double China's demand for crude oil and lead to a sharp increase in greenhouse-gas emissions, according to estimates by the government and environmental groups.

""If we follow the current track of consumption patterns to develop the automobile in China,"" says Pan Yue, vice minister of the State Environmental Protection Administration, ""the world will not be able to support"" it.

Complicating matters, Chinese gasoline contains high levels of sulfur and other contaminants. It will take years and billions of dollars to improve China's refineries to make higher-quality, cleaner-burning gas.

So far, calls for stricter car controls have been largely muted by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, which sets the country's economic-development policies.

The commission has put a priority on expanding the economy to generate jobs for the millions streaming into cities from China's countryside. Officials of provincial governments and cities -- whose performance is judged largely on their ability to boost gross domestic product -- are rushing into auto-making.

Guangdong, long known as China's export capital for consumer goods, says it wants to triple its auto-making capacity by 2010.

""How many color TV sets and refrigerators are equal to one automobile?"" asked Huang Huahua, governor of Guangdong on China's southern coast, at a government conference earlier this year. ""You are a fool if you don't make cars....If we still depend on color TVs and a few similar industries, then Guangdong's 9% GDP growth can no longer be assured.""

In 1997, Anhui province, one of the poorest in China, teamed up with the city of Wuhu to start a government-owned car maker, Chery Automobile Co. Last year, Chery sold nearly 190,000 vehicles, more than double its sales from 2004. The company says it has had trouble expanding capacity to keep pace with demand for its cars, which sell from $3,700 up to about $25,000.

In some cases, local governments share directly in car manufacturers' profits. Shanghai's government, for example, controls and receives dividend payments from state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp., which has joint ventures with both General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen AG.

For most of the auto's history in China, there were few cars and different priorities. After the Communists rose to power in 1949, China's auto industry focused on building military vehicles, buses and trucks. The Cultural Revolution of the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, which led to mass upheavals, hobbled the industry.

A Shift in the 1980s
China's modern car market grew slowly at first, as demand for relatively expensive cars was limited largely to government and Communist Party officials. After launching market overhauls more than two decades ago, China decided to bring in foreign expertise. In 1983, state-run Beijing Automotive signed the first joint-venture deal with American Motors Corp. to make Jeeps. Soon after, Shanghai Automotive went into business with Volkswagen.

By 1994, the government had decided that cars should play a central role in driving the country's industrial engine. The official government policy nodded toward environmental concerns, saying the government ""encourages"" the use of ""fuel-efficient and low-polluting"" vehicles. At the same time, however, officials also pressed for stepped-up production.

Even then, officials in Beijing and other cities were worried about mounting congestion and auto pollution. Beijing put varying restrictions on small cars and trucks, limiting where and when they could drive.

Development of mass transit lagged in Beijing and many other cities, creating more demand for cars. In the late 1990s, more than a dozen cities wanted subway systems. But China's central government delayed approval, partly due to budget constraints. Beijing's main east-west subway line was only finished in 2000, and large parts of the city are still inaccessible by rail.

The central government, meanwhile, was looking to strengthen the car industry by bringing in additional foreign expertise and resources. In 1997, GM won a coveted deal for a joint venture with Shanghai Automotive that now produces Buicks and other models. Many other foreign auto makers followed.

After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, falling prices sparked a jump in car purchases by China's more-affluent consumers.

Today, demand by middle-class buyers is surging as salaries rise and car prices, driven down by competition, plummet.

Liu Yunzhi, a 25-year-old computer-hardware designer, bought his first car, a $5,200 Chinese-made hatchback, soon after moving into an apartment in a Beijing suburb last year. He used it to haul furniture to his new home from Ikea.

""You don't have to be a rich guy to own a car,"" says Mr. Liu. ""You can enjoy your life more.""

Price wars have heated up as more local manufacturers have entered the fray. Mr. Liu's hatchback, for instance, was made by Geely Holding Group, which moved into autos after making motorcycles. BYD Co., a producer of cellphone batteries, got into the car business in 2003 after acquiring a formerly state-run assembly plant.

Rolling Stock
In Chongqing, a city in southwest China that is hoping to become the nation's car capital, auto factories spread over more than 20 million square meters, or around 5,000 acres. Metal-stamping plants, paint shops and assembly lines churned out more than 600,000 cars and other vehicles last year -- capacity that city officials hope to more than double by 2010.

Even in Shanghai's relatively diverse economy, the auto industry employed nearly 416,000 people, accounting for about 3.4% of GDP and more than $900 million in taxes in 2005, according to government figures.

Li Qisheng is 24 and has spent two years working on assembly lines for Geely in Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai. The son of farmers, Mr. Li now earns about $250 a month, or about $1.27 an hour, doing quality-control checks on new vehicles.

Mr. Li, who also receives subsidized meals and housing in a company dormitory, says he sends about half of his earnings home every month. ""It relieves the pressure on my parents,"" he says. Last year, his family used the money to build a new, five-story concrete house to replace an old two-floor wood home. ""I'm proud of myself,"" Mr. Li says.

The trickle-down of industry benefits has made it hard to put on the brakes. In 2000, Shanghai decided to tighten restrictions on new car registrations, auctioning off a limited number of license plates annually. But it has gradually loosened the strictures.

During the first year of the new program, Shanghai issued 14,000 plates for an average price of $1,700. Last year, it issued 67,078 for an average price of more than $4,000.

""Residents have a very strong demand of car use,"" says Zhu Junyi, a researcher at the Shanghai Information Center, a government think tank. The government, he adds, ""has to try its best to meet the demand.""

High Toll
The toll is high. Exhaust from an estimated 2.5 million vehicles has helped make Beijing one of the most polluted cities in China, even though it has shuttered many of the coal-burning factories that once fouled its air. In 2004, levels of airborne particulate in Beijing were more than six times as high as in New York, and sulfur-dioxide levels were more than double, according to Chinese and U.S. government figures.

It wasn't until 2000 that China passed its first comprehensive emissions law and made catalytic converters, which clean vehicle exhaust, mandatory. China has modeled is auto-emissions standards after those in Europe. Still, most of the country still lags behind Europe, using rules implemented there back in 1996. Beijing has a stricter standard, in line with regulations set by the European Union in 2000. The entire nation is slated to move to that cleaner standard by 2008.

Emissions testing for cars has been spotty, and experts complain that little is known about what comes out of China's tailpipes. Beijing officials say that more than 60% of the vehicles in the city have some emissions controls, an acknowledgment that up to 40% of them -- mostly older models -- have none at all.

In 2005, China imposed its first fuel-efficiency standards, which some analysts say will eventually be stricter than in the U.S. Earlier this year, the central government called on cities like Beijing to lift bans originally imposed on small cars in order to encourage purchases of more energy-efficient models. The government also instituted a graduated tax on new cars, designed to discourage purchases of gas guzzlers.

But to really limit cars' environmental toll and energy consumption, experts such as Lee Schipper, director of research at the World Resources Institute's Embarq Center for Transportation and the Environment in Washington, D.C., say China needs to levy road-use fees, lift gas prices and encourage the use of mass transit, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles.

""The rapid rate of growth is more than government institutions are prepared to deal with,"" says Mr. Schipper. When he suggests to local officials that Chinese cities limit the number of cars on the road, he says they resist. ""They say: 'You can't restrict cars.'"" "
132,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"For the past five years, village doctor Zhang Changjian has rallied farmers here against a chemical factory dumping pollutants into a river.

This spring, they won a rare victory. A court found the pollution exceeded acceptable levels and ordered the Rongping Joint Chemical Plant to pay damages of about $85,000. But the farmers have yet to see any of the settlement. Mr. Zhang has been the target of police harassment, and the county government has closed down his clinic.

When a chemical factory in rural China started dumping pollutants into a nearby river and cancer rates soared, village doctor Zhang Changjian, above, organized a campaign that called national attention to local farmers' plight. He drew inspiration from the movie ""Erin Brockovich,"" starring Julia Roberts, based on a true story of a woman's crusade for justice after similar pollution in California.

A quiet man with a crop of stubby, graying hair, Mr. Zhang, 46 years old, refuses to be cowed. He continues to dispense medicine and monitor Rongping, often circling the factory in plastic slippers, a camera clamped to his belt. ""Our food is still poisoned,"" says Mr. Zhang, pointing out the factory's wastewater spilling into the foul-smelling river that eventually flows into the East China Sea. ""The farmers can't sell their crops and they're too poor to move.""

Water pollution is among the most worrisome byproducts of China's rapid economic growth. Factories and cities dump some 40 to 60 billion tons of wastewater and sewage into lakes and rivers each year, according to Chinese government estimates. About 30% of China's rivers are so dirty they aren't fit for industrial or agricultural use, according to official statistics. Some 300 million Chinese -- roughly the size of the entire U.S. population -- don't have access to clean drinking water. The polluted water is becoming an international issue as it flows into Russia and other parts of Asia.

The government has sent mixed signals about how it intends to tackle the problem. Governmental bodies have given awards to environmental activists, published data stressing the magnitude of the pollution and relaxed controls on antipollution groups. That has allowed activists to form links and share notes, often via the Internet. ""We all know each other,"" says Wu Lihong, who has been fighting river pollution in his hometown near Shanghai.

But especially at the local level, many officials are loath to let activists influence how factories are run. Provincial, county and village officials depend on industry to advance economic growth and their own careers. By one government estimate, a total of $125 billion has been invested in China's chemical and petrochemical plants -- suggesting the size of the stakes. Even when a factory is shut down, it often reopens. The central government has capped the fines for environment violations at about $120,000, and provincial authorities often set even lower caps.

Anger over the lack of clean water and air is rising. According to Pan Yue, vice minister of the State Environmental Protection Administration, about 50,000 protests last year were due to pollution.

Authorities in Pingnan County, which includes Xiping, acknowledged in a statement to The Wall Street Journal that the Rongping plant was responsible for excessive pollution in its early years. They said Rongping has taken steps to rectify the problem since 2001 and discharge levels are now within government standards. Mr. Zhang agrees the situation has improved but says pollution is still excessive.

The plant pays a third of the county's tax and other revenues and has provided well-paying jobs for peasants in this mountainous part of Fujian Province. Officials cite the economic benefits in opposing the plant's closing.

The Rongping plant opened here in 1994. It had previously been in Fujian's capital, Fuzhou. Officials relocated it to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power from Xiping's mountain streams and promote rural economic development. A state-owned chemicals company based in Fuzhou is the plant's majority owner, although the Pingnan County government held a 30% stake until 2004.

With the factory's arrival, Xiping's population quickly doubled to 2,000 people. The plant became Asia's largest producer of potassium chlorate, a chemical widely used in bleach, fireworks and other goods. But it was also spewing chromium-6 into the river and belching chlorine from its smokestacks, according to a later provincial court verdict and the Fujian Province Environmental Supervision Center. The center said a sewage sample contained more than 20 times the amount of chromium-6 allowed by national standards. The statement by Pingnan County authorities confirms that chromium and chlorine were discharged but doesn't specify the amount or the type of chromium.

Chromium-6 plays a starring role in the movie ""Erin Brockovich."" It's based on a true story in which a paralegal (portrayed on screen by Julia Roberts) helped a California town's residents win $333 million from a utility that had leaked chromium into their water. Breathing chromium-6 has long been linked with lung cancer. According to U.S. authorities, ingesting the substance can damage the stomach, kidneys and liver.

Shortly after the Rongping factory opened, villagers started complaining that the emissions into the river were affecting their crops. Bamboo groves they harvested to sell to toy and chopstick makers shriveled and died. Downstream, in the nearby village of Houlong, Zheng Jiayao says he and his neighbors noticed fewer fish and shrimp and a strange smell coming from the green slime sometimes coating the water.

The factory offered to pay compensation to a handful of families whose plots abutted the factory gates. But it continued full operations.

Mr. Zhang is a ""barefoot doctor,"" someone trained by the government to administer simple remedies and sent to remote areas that are too small to attract a doctor with a full medical degree. He arrived in Xiping in 1984. Over the years, the father of four built a comfortable practice.

In the late 1990s Mr. Zhang began noticing a spike in illnesses including stomach ailments, skin rashes and breathing problems. Combing through handwritten notes, he saw the change dated back to the factory's opening in 1994. More alarming was a rise in cancer cases. The disease accounted for just one of 13 deaths in the village between 1990 and 1994. Between 1999 and 2001, 17 of 24 deaths were cancer-related, Mr. Zhang found. Cancer victims included two 18-year-old girls and a 3-year-old boy.

In 1999, Mr. Zhang and a handful of other farmers started a letter-writing campaign. He says he drew inspiration from the Erin Brockovich movie, of which he has a copy at home. ""I thought if the leaders only knew what was going on, they'd fix it,"" he said.

With each unanswered letter, he sent his complaints higher up the chain of command. Liu Xianbin, a former soldier with a gaunt frame who had developed cancer, enthusiastically joined in. Mr. Liu enlisted a friend to write a letter in English to former President Bill Clinton. He didn't get an answer, but he says he was questioned by local authorities about the letter and detained for a day.

In 2001, Mr. Zhang appealed to China's top environmental agency, and finally got an answer. He was told to organize a formal complaint. The doctor canvassed the villagers seeking signatures on a petition calling on the factory to stop polluting. He still has the original copy of the petition, on which farmers stamped a red thumbprint next to their signatures in the traditional Chinese manner. Mr. Zhang took soil and water samples and posted pictures of the dying bamboo groves on his Web site.

By the next year, the efforts started to bear fruit. The village head came out in support of Mr. Zhang. Villagers held a three-day leafleting campaign outside the county government offices, attracting attention from national newspapers and later a popular investigative segment on state-run national television. That summer, China's central government named Rongping one of the worst 55 polluters in China.

A rare victory: A provincial court awarded $85,000 in damages to villagers harmed by chemical pollution in Xiping's river, top. Executives at Rongping Joint Chemical Plant, bottom, say the company has now spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade its waste-water-treatment and chemical-storage facilities

The publicity drew the attention of China's only pro-bono environmental law group. The Center for Legal Assistance for Pollution Victims in Beijing decided to help the villagers bring a lawsuit against the factory. Villagers chipped in to pay several thousand dollars for environmental tests. Whenever they spotted acrid liquid being dumped into the river, they scooped it up in empty plastic water bottles, villagers and lawyers say. Eventually 1,721 villagers joined the lawsuit, the most in an environmental case in Chinese history, lawyers say.

Even as national institutions aided Mr. Zhang's fight, he faced resistance and harassment at the local level. He says he was assaulted by a thug while collecting samples and his wife was punched and shoved to the ground by an assailant who visited their home. The county government shut down his clinic, on the ground floor of his house, saying he hadn't properly renewed his license. He denies that and still informally helps villagers who seek his medical help.

A county court initially ruled in favor of the farmers but awarded them minimal damages. Both sides appealed and a provincial court handed down its verdict this March. It raised the award to about $85,000, still far below the $1.7 million in damages and compensation the plaintiffs had sought. After years of litigation, the average farmer would get only about $50.

The factory has paid the damages to the county court, which says it will disperse the money when there's a system for determining who suffered how much damage.

The fight has left factory executives bitter. He Zhang, vice head of the plant, says the media misled the poorly educated villagers and failed to give Rongping credit for improving its environmental standards. ""If you find any violations, please report them to us and we'll harshly punish those responsible,"" says Mr. He. ""I myself am living in Pingnan County for more than 20 days a month. How could I sacrifice my health and move away from a big city just to make money?""

In their statement to the Journal, the Pingnan authorities said the excessive pollution levels in the first few years of the factory's operation were due to poor equipment, untrained workers and management failures. More recently, the plant has undergone 35 random tests under the supervision of the county environmental protection bureau and passed all of them, the statement said. Rongping officials say the plant has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade its wastewater-treatment and chemical-storage facilities.

Zhang Yangtong, who worked until recently in the packing room at Rongping, sees both sides of the debate. His job freed him from long days in the field and allowed his son to attend a better school. But he says he experienced headaches and other pain. He plans to move far away and return to farming.

The former worker says farmer neighbors sometimes accused him of siding with the entity that was poisoning them. His response: ""It is the factory that is polluting, not us. We are just workers making a living here.""

The court victory brought little consolation to Xu Shilian, one of the plaintiffs, who runs the village store. Ms. Xu has cancer, according to Mr. Zhang, but the village doctor and her relatives have kept the truth from her, fearing she would give up hope. ""Even if we get the money it's too late. Not enough for treatment. Not enough to give me health,"" said Ms. Xu, 43, as she listlessly sold items that attest to Xiping's growing prosperity: packets of Pantene shampoo, phone cards and cola drinks.

Mr. Zhang acknowledges some improvements. Cancer rates have dropped off, and some brush has returned to once-barren hills. But replanted bamboo comes out scraggly. Villagers say there is no market for their mushroom, cabbage and other vegetables because people fear the produce is tainted.

Mr. Zhang says he is not going to give up his fight against the plant. ""I'm a doctor. This is what I'm supposed to do."""
133,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"The new musical fountain in this drab provincial capital in central China demonstrates why authorities in Beijing are having so much trouble controlling the world's fourth-largest economy.

Jets of water dance to the patriotic anthem ""Love My China,"" while laser beams shoot into the sky. Soon, the fountain will be overshadowed by a hotel styled after a classical Chinese pagoda, which, at 918 feet, will be nearly three-quarters as tall as the Empire State Building. A waterfront arts complex, almost completed at a cost of $100 million, looks like a clutch of enormous duck eggs. Nearby, a newly opened conference center resembles an unfurled umbrella. An exhibition hall boasts the biggest stretch of free-standing roof in Asia.

Mayor Zhao Jiancai says his vision is to transform backward Zhengzhou into the ""Chicago of the East"" -- a gateway between the booming coast and the vast interior -- by more than tripling the city's size. Total investment in the area around the business district could hit $35 billion. It is a huge amount of money for the capital of Henan province, one of China's poorest. Aiming to turn itself into the 'Chicago of the East,' Zhengzhou, China, is planning a 280-meter-tall hotel that is modeled after the pagodas at the nearby Shaolin monastery, famous for its kung-fu-fighting monks.

""We can only make achievements with scale,"" says the mayor, a former tractor factory engineer.

A similar dynamic is at work across China. Local governments are encouraging a frenzy of construction to boost their economies -- even as China's central government seeks to throttle back investment that is producing runaway economic growth. The economy expanded 11.3% in the second quarter of this year from the same period a year earlier, far outstripping the government's target of 8% for the whole year.

Many developing countries would gladly trade places with China: Most suffer from too little investment, not too much. And they worry more about spreading slums than expanding skylines.

Nevertheless, hyper-investment keeps roiling the world's fastest-growing major economy. Concerns are mounting that the boom could cause property bubbles that weigh down banks with bad debt when they burst. It also could clog railway lines and ports and trigger brown-outs as overloaded power grids collapse. Already, it is generating outsize demand for energy and raw materials, pushing up the cost around the world.

The International Monetary Fund, which is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Singapore, this week urged China to rein in credit to avoid ""tipping off a boom-bust cycle."" Construction of a nearly completed arts complex is costing around $100 million.

Though inflation remains low at 1.3%, China's top leaders are worried. Almost every day, they issue edicts to slow economic growth -- with little effect. Leaders can't even be sure how much municipalities are spending because local finances have become so murky. According to official figures that many economists believe understate the true total, fixed-asset investment rose 21.5% in August from a year earlier. While that growth rate was slower than the 27.4% of July, total annual investment as a percentage of gross domestic product, the total value of all goods and services produced in a nation, still is much higher than Japan, South Korea or Taiwan managed to sustain even during their giddy years.

If inflation takes hold, as some economists expect, the effects would be felt globally. Since China is the world's third-largest trading nation, inflation could ripple to the U.S. and other countries through rising prices for its exports. That would complicate the efforts of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks trying to head off rising inflationary pressures.

More than a quarter century of economic overhauls has produced a striking contrast in China: Politically, the Communist central government maintains a tight grip over the entire country; economically, it is losing control.

Caught in a Trap
China's leaders are caught in a trap as they cast around for ways to rein in investment. The old administrative methods -- ordering state banks to stop lending, restricting land sales, halting government approvals for major projects -- aren't working as well as before, partly because local governments are defying Beijing.

Trying to enforce investment curbs in a vast country is a tough challenge: Beijing has resorted to using satellite images to spot bulldozers working on illegal construction projects in far-flung provinces. The economy, says Andy Xie, an economist in Hong Kong with Morgan Stanley, is too big and complicated to manage through fiat.

On the other hand, market-oriented measures to slow economic growth, such as raising interest rates, aren't likely to be as effective in China as in more sophisticated economies. One reason is that local bankers still are susceptible to political pressure to extend loans. Also, state-run companies make a habit of not repaying loans, so the cost of funds often is irrelevant. Much of the corporate investment is funded out of company savings.

Already, the big state banks have ignored Beijing and dished out almost all the loans they were targeted to extend for the whole year. The Ministry of Land Resources announced recently that in some cities as many as 90% of all government land acquisitions are illegal.

To be sure, an economy expanding at double-digit rates sooner or later will likely find uses for much of the infrastructure -- highways, bridges and power plants -- that local governments are installing. But when the latest investment boom unwinds, there are concerns that Chinese cities will be littered with white elephant industrial projects that will stand empty for years.

""It's mindless,"" says Wang Lina, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a leading think tank, who says local governments are generating large amounts of wasteful investment.

About 10% to 20% of all investment in China is made by local governments, according to World Bank economist Louis Kuijs, who is based in Beijing. That figure understates their influence. For instance, it doesn't include investment by real-estate developers that are nominally private but often act as agents for local authorities.

Under China's former socialist economy, central planners in Beijing doled out investment funds under an annual quota program -- so much for the railroads, for the power industry, for steelmakers. China's central government grabbed local revenue and redistributed the cash around the country to pay for further investment as well as government services.

This started changing in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping launched economic overhauls that made local governments responsible for delivering growth to their own communities. Economic growth has become the path to career glory for city mayors, like Zhengzhou's Mr. Zhao, who now are driving the national economy to an unprecedented extent. Hong Liang, an economist in Hong Kong with Goldman Sachs, compares modern Chinese cities to corporations, and their mayors to chief executive officers, all competing with each other to expand their business empires.

There are good reasons why China's cities need to expand. Each year, they have to accommodate at least 10 million peasants flooding in from the countryside. Increasingly, cities also have been forced to fund their own health, education and social-welfare programs.

These financial pressures all feed into higher rates of investment, which is the quickest way for cities to expand their economies and increase their revenue.

Economic Giants
Cities in China have ballooned into economic giants. If Shanghai were a country, it would be among the 40 largest economies in the world. Its economic output last year of $114 billion was bigger than the Philippines or the Czech Republic. Shenzhen, in southern China, has an economy much larger than Vietnam's.

Still, many question whether local spending has become excessive. Zhengzhou's new conference hall, for instance, boasts a theater with seats that can be individually climate-controlled. Its vast foyer is clad in shimmering Italian marble.

Zhengzhou's drastic makeover is typical of those under way in cities around China. Shanghai led the way in the early 1990s by setting out to build a national financial and commercial hub on a stretch of rice paddy in an area called Pudong.

 

Over the years, Shanghai's urban plans have become ever more fanciful. It now is building a series of satellite cities -- each themed after a European country -- to relieve pressure on the city center. Anting, which aspires to be a car-making hub, is re-creating the pastel-colored apartment blocks and Bauhaus offices found in the German city of Weimar. It has even splurged on a Formula 1 race track.

Nearby, the emerging college city of Songjiang turned to a British engineering consultancy to construct an English-style community called Thames Town. There, residents can choose to live in Victorian terraced houses, drink in pubs and marry in a church whose spire rises over cobblestone lanes.

In March, Premier Wen Jiabao unveiled a five-year economic blueprint to steer China in a new direction. Instead of go-for-broke growth that has blighted the environment and widened social divisions, China would pursue more-balanced development. Still, growth is running at its fastest pace in 12 years.

China's leaders sought to curb credit by pushing through two interest-rate increases. They have taken funds out of the banking system by raising reserve requirements -- money that commercial banks must deposit with the central bank rather than lend out -- and slapped new taxes on real-estate transactions.

The two interest-rate increases this year have been too incremental -- each only 0.27 percentage point -- to have a real impact, economists say. Lending rates still are only around 6%, low for an economy expanding 14% in nominal terms, not taking into account inflation. By contrast, U.S. rates are at 5.25% -- up from 1% more than two years ago -- in an economy now expanding around 3%.

Compounding the problem is the way local governments are forced to fund their investments. China's central government doesn't allow them to raise local taxes or issue debt. Instead, they are cashing in their most valuable asset -- land. The sale of land now accounts for 40% to 60% of all local government revenue, according to Ms. Wang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

This dynamic adds momentum to the geographical expansion of cities. To acquire more land that they can sell, cities simply redraw their boundaries to engulf the surrounding farms. The compensation they pay to farmers for the land is far less than its value to developers. When the city flips the land, the revenue isn't part of regular budgets that can be audited by Beijing.

Zhengzhou, an ancient city on the Yellow River plains of central China, has long been an underachiever. Its 1950s-era textile mills are laying off workers. It has shuttered some of its grimy aluminum works on Beijing's orders to cut back on overcapacity. One of its few claims to fame is that it makes a third of all the frozen dumplings sold in China.

With a population of just two million, it considered itself too small to drive the economy of China's most populous province, with roughly 100 million people, let alone make a national impact.

The Zhengdong New District, left, which covers 150 square kilometers, will double the city's size and add 1.5 million people to the existing population of two million. A nearly completed arts complex, above, is costing around $100 million.

So in 2001, city authorities hired the acclaimed Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa to draw up blueprints for the new urban area after an international competition. Zhengdong New District covers 58 square miles -- somewhat bigger than San Francisco. The plan will double the size of the city and add 1.5 million people to the existing population. It received the blessing of the State Council -- China's cabinet -- in 1995.

By 2020, Mr. Zhao says, additional enlargement will turn Zhengzhou into a city of five million covering 193 square miles.

Most of the investments will be made by companies rather than the government, says Mr. Zhao, 50, who sports red ties and slicks back his hair. Bank loans will pay for some infrastructure as well.

The skyline of the central business district eventually will be populated by 60-odd commercial and residential towers. The first are already in place and waiting for tenants to move in.

Radiating outward will be arrayed the industries and services of Zhengzhou's future: banking and finance, insurance, logistics, high-technology manufacturing and higher education. ""It's the most advanced urban concept in the world,"" says Vice Mayor Wang Qinghai, who is directly responsible for the construction of the Zhengdong New District. Land prices have quadrupled in two years.

Mr. Wang says Beijing has given the go-ahead to projects covering only about 20% of the planned new area. That is holding up plans for a man-made island on a lake to house dozens of luxury apartments.

Elsewhere, there are few signs building momentum is slowing. The city's own glossy publicity materials boast that Zhengzhou has one of the highest densities of construction cranes operating in China.

Does Zhengzhou have a shot at becoming the ""Chicago of China""? True, it sits at a railway crossroads between the main north-south and east-west lines, a major asset in a country where most goods still are moved by train. But there is plenty of competition from other central cities, including Wuhan farther south, as well as Nanchang, the fast rising capital of Jiangxi province.

Mayor Zhao says he is untroubled by the competition. ""We all have our strengths,"" he says. ""We'll fly together wing-to-wing."""
134,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"China is trying to revive poor rural regions through economic development. In Tibet, the plan has hit a snag: Ni Ma won't slaughter his yaks.

Duan Xiangzheng, a Chinese Communist Party official charged with stimulating the economy here, is pushing for the systematic slaughtering of yaks to kick-start a meat-packing industry. Mr. Duan says exporting the beefy tasting meat and the animals' black wool to markets elsewhere in China makes economic sense and is an ""inevitable"" development.

China's government is trying to commoditize the business of raising yaks, to kick-start a meat-packing industry in the region.

Ni Ma, 45 years old, wants to keep alive his 70 yaks, his family's most valuable and beloved asset. He sells yak milk, which is processed into the butter, cheese and yogurt that are the staples of Tibetan diet and Buddhist ritual. Even the dung is used, for fuel. Fingering a cigarette on his vast ranch, Ni Ma says his family slaughtered just three of its herd last year, even though ""the local government requested that we kill more.""

This remote, mountainous place, known mostly in the West as a human-rights cause, is feeling the force of China's economic juggernaut. The government in Beijing says it wants to make its 12 western provinces resemble the country's booming eastern seaboard. Lured by this vision, and by a new train connecting Tibet with the rest of China, entrepreneurs as well as tourists are flooding into the region known as ""the roof of the world.""

Yet Tibet is also still very much a rural place -- some 80% of its 2.7 million population is spread out on grasslands that cover almost a quarter of the country. Tibetans are protective of their distinctive Buddhist culture, which abhors the killing of animals. Many are suspicious of Chinese interference and some see the economic integration, part of the government's six-year-old ""Go West"" policy, as a form of colonization.

Tibetans already believe that Chinese are taking over the economy. In the capital, Lhasa, it is difficult to find a local-born taxi driver, waiter or laborer, since Chinese from other provinces will work for lower wages. Even on the $4.1 billion railway project, only about 10% of the 100,000 construction workers hailed from Tibet, according to Zhu Zhensheng, a Ministry of Railways official. Now completed, the train promises to deliver an extra 800,000 visitors a year.

Tibet lags behind other Chinese regions in many areas, including literacy rates, life expectancy and average per-capita income, which is under $250 a year in rural areas. Unlike the U.S. West, where access to the Pacific Ocean opened new trade routes, China's western regions border land-locked central Asia, home to some of the poorest and most remote locations on earth.

 

Nagqu, which means ""Black River,"" is a county situated 15,000 feet above sea level on the northern steppe of the Tibetan Plateau, about 125 miles north of Lhasa. On a typical day, the temperature is below freezing. Its main town is a military base and truck stop, where garbage is left to smolder in open containers on streets that aren't lit at night, a gritty contrast to Tibet's legendary Shangri-la reputation.

Beijing's nationwide goal is to halt two decades of creeping inequality between urban and rural income, a gap the United Nations Development Program said last year may represent the world's most-uneven distribution of wealth. The Communist Party recognizes that its future depends on keeping people happy in the countryside, home to more than 80% of Chinese.

Shortly after China's communists took power in 1949, they grabbed control of Tibet, then an independent state. In 1959, the region's spiritual leader, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who was 23 at the time, fled on foot over the Himalayan Mountains, fearing arrest. China's efforts to discredit the Dalai Lama, who in 1989 won the Nobel Peace Prize, have fueled support for one of the world's most-celebrated human-rights causes.

In the 1960s, the government tried instituting communal ranching and other Communist economic policies, with the same disastrous results -- such as famine -- seen elsewhere. During the next two decades, Beijing relaxed its supervision of the Tibetan economy and later started celebrating Tibetans as ethnic treasures, one of 55 groups distinct from the 93% of China who are of the Han race. But by the late 1990s, Tibet's economic semi-autonomy began to look like neglect as the region fell behind the sizzling east.

In Nagqu, the job of helping Tibet catch up has fallen to Mr. Duan, a 50-year-old agricultural expert from Beijing. An ethnic Han, Mr. Duan can't speak Tibetan. Like most outsiders, he says he struggled with the effects of its high altitude and thin air.

Still, he can count. The 7.4 million livestock in Nagqu far outnumber people and generate a third of the county's $400 million in gross domestic product. Yaks, sheep and cows, which Mr. Duan calls the region's ""pillar industry,"" are key to his goal: 50% GDP growth this year and a quadrupling of the local economy over five years.

Supporting his quest is the world's highest-altitude train, the $4.1 billion Qinghai-Tibet Railway, that at times travels 16,641 feet above sea level. Completed this summer, it links Tibet with the outside world by rail for the first time, including Beijing 1,572 miles away. Its tracks are set in permafrost and an oxygen system helps riders combat altitude sickness. It will eventually run to the Indian border.

Chinese officials compare the rail's significance with that of America's transcontinental railroad. The train has made Tibet much more accessible -- passengers can ride from Beijing for less than $200 -- and the cost of transporting freight is less than half that charged by truckers.

The world's highest-altitude bottling plant, Hong Kong-based Tibet Glacier Mineral Water Co., wants to use the train to transport branded water to Shanghai called ""5,100,"" as in meters above sea level. The Yulong copper mine in eastern Tibet contains China's biggest deposit, with more than 10 million metric tons of proven reserves. In Nagqu, Canada's Sterling Group Ventures Inc. says it has signed a letter of intent with a Beijing company to extract lithium carbonate from a salt-water lake. The mineral is used to make batteries and glass.

Wu Yongpan, a 28-year-old entrepreneur from south China, bought an $85 ticket for a middle bunk on the first train into Lhasa last month. He figured getting to China's new western frontier quickly would give him a head start in the wholesale jewelry business. ""Tibet is now opened,"" he says.

After nearly a month in Tibet, Mr. Wu says he found business trickier than he imagined, not least of all because, ""Tibetans are not very open minded."" Jewelry makers wanted to be paid in cash because they weren't comfortable using wire transfers. Jewelry distributors in southern Guangdong Province said the samples Mr. Wu bought were too big and heavy for the Chinese market. Mr. Wu says he didn't like the food and that his skin felt dry.

He plans to make a second prospecting visit before the end of this year, perhaps to sell electronics. ""The culture question is a very big one ... but if I do business for a while, I can learn a little and pass it on to my friends,"" Mr. Wu says.

The culture question looms large in the yak business. Where rancher Ni Ma lives, rocky flatlands stretch to bald mountains on the horizon, and brushes of green grass are the only summertime vegetation. Three generations of his 10-person family sleep in two rooms of a concrete house with no electricity. Inside, a Buddhist shrine is set on top of a row of hand-painted Tibetan cabinets, contrasting with posters of Chinese luminaries such as Mao Zedong.

In a bow to tradition, when Ni Ma slaughtered his three yaks last fall, he paused for a ""crying"" rite on behalf of each animal slaughtered, a ceremony he is teaching to his seven children. Before a rope is fixed around the neck of a yak to be suffocated -- considered the least painful way to kill -- Tibetan nomads comfort the animal by putting Buddhist blessing pills and holy water into its mouth, while holding smoky butter candles near its nose.

 

The term comes from the good wishes read when an animal or person dies, called bsngo-ba, which is pronounced like the word for cry -- ngu wa -- according to Tibetans and foreign experts.

A decision to slaughter an animal is, ""not a simple market transaction,"" says Gabriel Lafitte, a lecturer in Asian civilizations and science at the University of Melbourne, and a long-time critic of China's role in Tibet. ""It's a very quiet, simple dignified ritual.""

Mr. Duan, the Communist Party official, dismisses the crying rites. He says emotion is unsuitable for the slaughterhouse industry he envisages. ""The traditional concept has contained the economic development in our region,"" Mr. Duan says. ""These traditional concepts will have to be changed."" The local government also cites a need to fill its budget deficit.

Beijing thinks Tibet has too many yaks, which aren't raised systematically and threaten the grasslands through over-grazing. The Nagqu government is trying to enforce an edict from the Grasslands Construction Authority, the body that decides how such land is used, stating that no more than one yak can be raised per 120 mu, a Chinese measure equivalent to about eight hectares.

Nagqu's yak herders are trying to break into distant markets through a government-funded dairy cooperative. Tibetan butter, cheese and yogurt, all made from yak milk, are slowly becoming specialty products overseas. Tibetan Ragya Yak Cheese has been irregularly imported to New York by Slow Food U.S.A., a not-for-profit organization.

After sampling the Ragya Yak Cheese this year, chef Riccardo Buitoni of the Aurora restaurant in Brooklyn, N.Y., developed a pasta incorporating the ""amazing cheese."" Mr. Buitoni says he will put the dish on his menu permanently if he can get regular supplies. It reminds him of the unpasteurized cheese he ate as a child in Italy.

Local officials also used the cooperative to lean on yak farmers to slaughter enough animals each year to keep the herd from growing.

Yak meat tastes like tough beef. The woolly animals are two-thirds the size of cows but they're pound-for-pound more valuable; both sell for about $750. The meat is often available jerk-dried or as an ingredient for dipping into a hot pot consisting of an oily, spicy soup. At Ba Guo Bu Yi, a Sichuan-style restaurant in Shanghai, raw yak meat is a delicacy that sells for $16 a plate compared with a cold beef plate at $3.25.

So far, however, there isn't much cargo leaving Tibet. About 60 loaded freight cars a day have pulled into Lhasa since freight services began in March, some of them ferrying supplies for China's military. Railway officials say through July, only about two dozen stocked freight cars left Lhasa for other parts of China.

In the Sichuan town of Manigango last year, some 300 ethnic Tibetans rioted and burned down a year-old slaughterhouse operated by Sichuan Longsheng Group. Ranchers said they faced government pressure to sell livestock to the company for slaughter, according to human-rights groups and an official at the company. The slaughterhouse has reopened ""but business is not good,"" says a Longsheng official. ""Tibetans aren't willing to kill their yaks. They just keep them and raise them,"" he says

For Ni Ma, the train had an immediate financial impact. As the construction work stretched into Nagqu, he was hired as part of the preparation crew. The work tripled his $250 yearly herding income.

Now the railroad is complete, Ni Ma says he recognizes the potential of a business-like approach to slaughtering his yaks. But for ""family"" reasons, he says he still isn't comfortable with it in practice."
135,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"Zou Tao has become an unlikely hero in this profit-driven city of half-built apartment complexes and luxury villas: He is calling for a boycott of the real-estate market.

It is a daring grass-roots campaign, designed to tamp down overheated property prices, that he says has gotten him in trouble with police and attracted threats -- but also the backing of people across the country.

Since he posted an open letter on his Internet blog in April urging Shenzhen residents to stop buying property, Mr. Zou says, he has been deluged with more than 150,000 pledges of support nationwide. The 32-year-old golf-equipment dealer has evidently tapped into a deep resentment against powerful real-estate developers and their local-government backers. They have helped push prices so high that many city residents can't afford to buy, even while numerous units held by speculators remain empty.

""Millions of Chinese citizens stand behind you,"" read one message that lit up Mr. Zou's cellphone.

His attack on Shenzhen's property barons says much about a mood of defiance, when it comes to housing, that is sweeping China's normally apolitical middle class. Soaring property prices are widening social divisions in what is already one of the most unequal societies on earth. The average cost of a new apartment in Shenzhen has shot up to about $125,000, the equal of 10 years' salary for a college-educated professional there.

The excesses of a real-estate industry that is focused on the top end of the market have also raised the risk of a property bubble in some big cities, from Shenzhen on the southern coast of China to Shanghai and Beijing farther north.

Around the country, local governments sometimes face violent protests from peasants whose farms have been gobbled up by voraciously expanding cities. Tension is simmering among inner-city workers whose homes are bulldozed to make way for high rises. Now, anger is building among the very group that stood to benefit most from China's warp-speed development: the aspiring middle class, where so many are being priced out.

Behind the surge lie contradictory priorities that arose over two decades of fast growth. Leaders in Beijing, fearful of the social unrest income disparities can cause, are eager to develop affordable mass housing. Yet city governments, competing with one another to expand their economies and build infrastructure, rely heavily on land sales to developers and taxes on expensive property. Their interest is to maximize profits.

The upshot is backing for Mr. Zou's boycott campaign from people like David Huang, a 32-year-old manager at a high-tech factory in Shenzhen.

Mr. Huang and his wife have been saving for years to buy a home in which to raise their son, now 7. At the end of last year, they had enough for a deposit on a three-bedroom apartment. But Mr. Huang says he got busy at work and put off the paperwork. His delay proved costly. Since January, he says, pointing a finger toward the ceiling of a Shenzhen coffee shop, the price has zoomed by 40%.

How could prices keep soaring at the same time as supply is? ""It's all speculation and manipulation,"" says Mr. Huang, who continues to rent. ""If developers want to make a reasonable profit, I can take that. But this is out of control.""

Those who do buy include a cross section of the affluent, many of whom are evidently speculators. They include prosperous ethnic Chinese from Taiwan and Hong Kong, managers at foreign-owned enterprises, and urban yuppies who got in when prices were affordable and are borrowing to buy more. Many of these buyers appear confident that foreign companies will continue to pour into China's big cities, and expatriates will sop up the many still-empty apartments. Kenny Tse, a real-estate analyst for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, estimates that 25% to 40% of the buyers of new urban apartments pay cash.

But for Mr. Huang to buy, he would have to spend half of his $800 monthly salary on the mortgage. That would be impossible, he says, given how much he must save to protect himself against medical and other emergencies in a society that has only a flimsy social safety net. A mortgage of the size needed to buy, he says, would ""mean I can't lose my job. It means I can't get sick.""

For many years under China's socialist system, private home ownership was frowned on. The Communists seized all private property, and employers provided workers with subsidized housing, the rent a pittance. But in 1995, China's leaders launched a privatization experiment in Guangdong, the province surrounding Shenzhen on China's southern coast. There, the provincial government authorized individual state-run enterprises to sell off their housing stock inexpensively to their workers. That program was later rolled out around the country, creating the beginnings of a private housing market.

At the same time, Beijing encouraged the growth of mortgage lending, which spurred construction of more private housing. Besides easing the burden on factories, authorities hoped this program would fuel the expansion of cities as economic engines and support an array of industries, from home furnishings to financial services.

The ensuing building boom has reverberated through the global economy. Partly to fuel its pell-mell real-estate construction, China consumes vast amounts of steel, copper and cement, inflating global commodity prices. Meanwhile, its trade surpluses leave it awash in cash that state banks are all to eager to lend -- further stimulating both the building and the buying of housing. And if credit weren't enough to steer investors into housing, they face a paucity of other places for their cash, what with bank deposit rates fixed at 2.25%.

In one gauge of the vigor of the housing market, Ikea has opened a superstore in Beijing that is second in size only to its flagship store in Sweden.

But it is unclear how sustainable this boom is. Some economists warn that Chinese cities are becoming so overbuilt they face a price collapse. The more optimistic dismiss the concern, noting that annual house-price increases have been roughly tracking double-digit rises in urban salaries over the past several years.

Making it harder to know who is right: China lacks many of the detailed housing statistics common in the West, such as rates of vacancies, inventories and resale prices. The lack of data leaves prospective buyers at loss when faced with a hard sell from buyers -- and may keep the developers, themselves, from sensing the extent of their overbuilding.

Vacancy estimates for new residential buildings in Shanghai run as high as 25% -- yet about 250,000 new apartments flood the market each year, official figures show. In Shanghai's suburbs, the surplus has begun to cool prices, which after a run-up are off 25% in the past year. In Beijing, meanwhile, property prices are soaring ahead of the 2008 Olympics. But rents on luxury homes there are falling, suggesting that prices are supported more by speculation than real demand.

""It's going to turn bad,"" predicts Peter Churchouse, who runs the Lim Asia Alternative Real Estate fund in Hong Kong.

A property bust, potentially far bigger than one that struck in the late 1990s, could batter China's economy. Investment in real estate is likely to approach 10% of gross domestic product this year. The World Bank estimates that 20% to 30% of lending by China's big state banks goes to real estate. Serious trouble in housing could bury them in bad loans.

The central government has taken steps to head off such a scenario. Last month, it announced a ban on new villa developments -- walled compounds of townhouses and freestanding homes -- as part of a slew of directives aiming at forcing local governments to build more low-cost housing and at driving out speculators. For residential property held less than five years, Beijing imposed a 20% capital-gains tax on profit and a 5.5% levy on the total sales price. It also raised the minimum down payment (to 30% from 20%) and said developers must reserve 70% of new projects for smaller units. But the new rules are full of loopholes, and past efforts by Beijing to rein in prices have all failed.

Benefits from the property boom have flowed unevenly. Of the 20 wealthiest people on the 2005 ""China Rich List,"" compiled by British accountant Rupert Hoogewerf, half are in real estate and all have a net worth of more than $500 million.

But in Beijing, 70% of the population falls beneath the income level needed to buy a home, according to a think tank at Beijing Normal University. Take Price Wu, a 32-year-old software engineer who earns $1,000 a month. His salary ranks him among China's affluent, but he is still looking for an affordable place to buy.

Last year, Mr. Wu says, he lost his girlfriend because he couldn't bring himself to take the financial risk of buying an apartment she insisted they needed before marriage. His ambitions are modest. ""I don't want a villa, just a very ordinary apartment will do,"" he says.

Mr. Wu is weary of the games he says real-estate companies play. ""They'll tell you that they only have five apartments left. They say, 'Buy now or they'll all be gone,' "" he says.

Mr. Wu doesn't expect that Mr. Zou's boycott campaign will collapse property prices, but hopes that ""it might at least stabilize them."" He adds: ""If the masses get together and show their force, nothing can stand in their way.

In challenging developers, Mr. Zou recognizes he has crossed the line from consumer advocacy to political activism. In China, some of the biggest developers are backed by local governments and work closely with state-owned banks.

A former soldier, Mr. Zou was born in a poor village in the central province of Hunan. He says he grew up with a passion for defending the weak and exploited, and got into importing and exporting golf equipment simply as a way to fund his work as a consumer advocate.

His activism made him a minor celebrity in his adopted home of Shenzhen. Last September, in a public hearing to discuss a controversial proposal to raise parking fees, Mr. Zou turned up with the results of his own online survey showing that 85% of 12,301 people he questioned opposed the increase. In the end, the government slashed the proposed increase.

He wasn't prepared for the resistance to his latest crusade. He says plainclothes security agents seized him at the Shenzhen airport last month as he tried to board a flight to Beijing to present a letter to Premier Wen Jiabao complaining that urban residents have become ""house slaves"" to developers. The agents grilled him overnight but let him go the next day, he says. He jumped on the first available plane to Beijing and delivered his petition to the State Council, the equivalent of the Chinese cabinet.

Mr. Zou has also run into trouble from other quarters. He just laid off the last of his 15 employees, he says, because he feared for their safety after they received anonymous telephone threats. His downtown office, once bursting with samples of Titleist golf balls and MacGregor sports bags, sits almost empty. A few days ago, he says, somebody apparently cut fine slits in the rear tires of his car. He says a mechanic who noticed the damage told him the rubber could have burst open at high speed and caused a crash.

""A lot of people hate me,"" Mr. Zou says, slumped in his executive desk chair in a yellow golf shirt and khaki chinos. ""They think I'm stealing their fortune.""

Li Ning, a marketing manager for Shenzhen's newest office tower, the 52-story Times Square built by Hong Kong-backed Excellence Group, offers a guarded view of Mr. Zou's campaign. ""I may not agree with what he says, but I support his right to say it,"" he says.

Mr. Li puts the blame for Shenzhen's rising property prices in part on the local government, which he says miscalculated the explosive growth of the city from a stretch of farmland in the 1970s. Today, it has 12 million people but is short of public transportation between its heavily built-up downtown and its spacious suburbs. The result is a scramble for living space in the inner city. ""Extreme price rises and falls aren't good for us,"" Mr. Li says. ""We want stability.""

Shortly after Mr. Zou posted his blog message calling for the boycott, the state-run China Youth Daily newspaper conducted an Internet survey among 9,000 people asking for their reaction: 79.1% of interviewees offered their support. "
136,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"The Swiss heir to a trucking fortune and a team of scientists want to save the Yangtze River's white dolphins. But nobody is sure there are any left.

Last month, August Pfluger led a team of Chinese, Japanese, Swiss and American scientists in search of the baiji, a shy, nearly blind freshwater mammal known for centuries in Chinese legend as the Goddess of the Yangtze.

In the early 1990s, scientists estimated that there were about 200 baiji left, dodging the freighters and fishing boats clogging the river. By 1997, at the time of the last reliable sighting, scientists estimated that, at most, only about 17 of the 6-foot-long dolphins remained.

If this dolphin is now deemed to be extinct, scientists say it would be one of the few large aquatic mammals to be wiped out in 300 years. In the 1950s, the Caribbean monk seal was hunted to extinction. Other species have been pushed to the brink but have crawled back. By most reckonings, China's baiji has been pushed too far.

""It's a big thing to have a large mammal go extinct on our watch,"" said Bob Pitman, an ecologist from the U.S., looking for the dolphin through binoculars.

The baiji highlights the costs of China's untrammeled economic growth, which has polluted its skies and fouled its waters. The baiji, known for its chopsticks-like snout and uncanny sonar ability to navigate the muddy Yangtze, appears to have fallen victim to Chinese government inaction and insufficient international attention.

""Nobody cares about that damn animal -- maybe we are crazy,"" said the 42-year-old Mr. Pfluger as he unfurled a banner bearing the name of his foundation, Swiss-based baiji.org, across the rust-streaked boat.

To pull off the expedition, Mr. Pfluger brought together a group of scientists from the East and the West, including Mr. Pitman, a marine ecologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Wang Ding, China's leading champion of the baiji.

Since the late 1970s, China has recorded unprecedented growth of about 10% a year. But the side effects have deeply scarred China's landscape. One-third of the country suffers from severe acid rain. More than 300 million people lack access to clean drinking water, and more than half of the country's waterways are badly polluted. China claims some 47 critically endangered animal species on the Red List of threatened species, kept by the World Conservation Union, a voluntary organization of concerned scientists. Other endangered species are the Chinese alligator and the Yangtze River sturgeon.

In October, the United Nations Environment Program declared the Yangtze and Pearl River estuaries dead zones. The water doesn't have enough oxygen in it to support fish.

""The baiji is a beautiful mammal, on top of the food chain, close to human beings. If the Yangtze can't support baiji, then it can't support human beings,"" said Mr. Wang, as the boat sailed past belching factories, some spewing waste.

It wasn't always so. A few thousand years ago, the Yangtze was the Amazon of the East, rich in wildlife like alligators, elephants, giant sturgeons and an unusually large salamander. Scientists believe the baiji first moved into the area some 20 million years ago, making it one of the oldest species of dolphin. It developed in near total isolation from any other species of dolphin or whale. In the silty waters, its eyes atrophied, and it became nearly blind.

The baiji relies on a highly developed sense of sound to locate food and swim around obstacles, rather like bats bouncing sound waves off distant objects to judge their location. The baiji's long lower jaw works like a boom microphone to focus sound waves that are funneled to ears protected from distracting noise by a thick pad of fat. Other dolphins use their own sonar, too, but they also rely on vision.

The first mention of the baiji dates back 2,000 years to Guo Po, a Jin dynasty scholar who described it in the Erya, China's oldest dictionary. Later, the strange creature found its way into a love story, where it turned into a beautiful woman like a mermaid. That's why fishermen called the baiji the goddess of the Yangtze and said the animal could foretell bad weather.

The baiji was unknown in the West until 1918, when the 17-year-old son of a missionary shot and killed one while duck hunting. Charles Hoy and his father sent the skull to the Smithsonian Institution, where it was identified as a new species.

Not much more was known about the baiji until a Swiss scientist named Giorgio Pilleri came to China and studied the creature in the late 1970s.

As China's economy grew, the baiji started dying off. The sandbanks where the animals liked to lurk were dredged. Channels were dynamited. Baiji competed with fishermen for food, and were often entangled in nets. All the engine noise confused the dolphins. During the chaotic years of the Cultural Revolution, some hungry fishermen even took to eating the bitter flesh of the dolphin.

By the time China was slowly opening to the outside world after decades of self-imposed isolation, the dolphin was in trouble. In 1978, the central government decided to set up a special group of scientists to study the dying species; the group is now headed by Mr. Wang.

Known in China as Mr. Baiji, Mr. Wang first began to grow fond of the creature in 1980 while he was nurturing a badly injured baiji brought by some fishermen to the Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan, a city on the Yangtze.

Mr. Wang and others put the dolphin, which they named Qiqi, in a fishpond, applied a traditional Chinese poultice, and nursed the animal back to health. Mr. Wang and others took care of Qiqi until he died of old age in July 2002. ""It was like losing a family member,"" Mr. Wang says.

Mr. Pfluger met Mr. Wang and was impressed with his dedication. Despite the baiji's critically endangered status, Mr. Pfluger felt that not enough had been done to save it. Part of the problem, Mr. Pfluger says, is that Chinese and international scientists disagreed on strategy. The Chinese wanted to take baiji out of the polluted river and relocate them to an isolated reserve, like one created for pandas. Many Western conservationists said the trauma of removing the dolphins could kill them.

A few finless porpoises -- smaller, stouter mammals with blunt noses -- were moved into a reserve, along with one baiji. The porpoises survived, but the captive baiji died.

By 2004, time was running out. Fewer fishermen were spotting baiji. Mr. Pfluger stepped in to help assemble a team of foreign and international scientists to go looking for them.

Now, and for the next six weeks, researchers will take turns scanning the horizon for any glint of snout and fin sticking through the water. If they find more than 10, they will discuss what to do next. The chances of that don't seem good. Most of the scientists on the boat aren't optimistic that they will find any.

For years, Mr. Pitman, the U.S. marine ecologist, has searched the world's rivers and oceans for rare species of dolphins and whales. This trip, he says, will be the toughest. ""The chance of seeing the baiji is overshadowed by the foregone conclusion it's nearly extinct. I've come to pay my last respects."""
137,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"China's embrace of market forces in the past three decades has reshaped virtually every aspect of its people's lives. Much of the impact has been positive. Hundreds of millions have escaped dollar-a-day poverty. The average Chinese citizen is wealthier, and enjoys far more economic and political freedom, than when overhauls began in 1978.

But the transformation has also wiped out much of a cradle-to-grave safety net -- health care, education, pensions -- that ensured basic needs were met for most of the population. It has severely damaged large parts of the country's environment, and triggered a widening gap between rich and poor.

Indeed, while China's government still calls its system socialist, and still plays a big role in the economy, what has developed here sometimes resembles a sort of naked capitalism, where an unfettered pursuit of profit governs almost all facets of life, and a growing share of the population is left unprotected.

Aware that the social tensions spawned by these trends could undermine their authority, China's Communist Party leaders have put dealing with social inequities at the top of their agenda. President Hu Jintao's administration has promised a range of initiatives as part of his overarching policy goal of creating a ""harmonious society."" The pledges include lowering taxes on farmers, raising the minimum wage, curbing corruption and strengthening environmental safeguards.

The rest of the world has a big stake in this race, too: By casting its fortunes with the global economy, China has entwined its fate with those of governments and companies spanning the earth. The country now powers global economic growth. And it plays a more reliable role in sticky international issues, such as how to defang a nuclear North Korea. A shock to China's system, a burst of instability stemming from internal unrest, would reverberate through boardrooms and capitals the world over.

But the party consistently confronts a big, intractable obstacle to achieving its stated aim of defusing social tensions: itself.

Widespread official graft persists despite a multiyear crackdown. In the countryside, local officials frequently conspire with developers to buy land from subsistence farmers at cut rates. Some nominally public schools charge prohibitively steep tuition. State-owned companies are among the biggest polluters. Even upright local officials, knowing that promotions depend on their success in boosting local economies, often defy directives that conflict with the goal of growth at all costs.

The upshot is that a party that projects an image of monolithic unity -- at home and abroad -- is finding that one of its greatest challenges lies in bringing to heel the very officials it relies on to implement its orders.

From Shenzhen in the south to Beijing in the north, and often in defiance of Party edicts, developers with close ties to local governments are covering cities with luxury real-estate developments, even as housing prices soar to levels many urban Chinese can't afford. Meanwhile, underfunded government hospitals turn away patients who can't afford cash upfront for treatment. Government-backed automobile companies churn out the cars that are increasingly cloaking China's urban skies with smog. And state-run tobacco companies, keen for profit, peddle trillions of cigarettes a year, though smoking-related diseases and health-care costs continue to soar.

Nowhere are the challenges for China's government greater than with its deteriorating environment. The problem is nationwide. A potassium chlorate factory in the village of Xiping in the southeastern province of Fujian dumps chemicals for years in a nearby river, in defiance of court orders, destroying local crops. A factory that makes lead ingots in Gansu in the west spits out waste that afflicts some 250 children with lead poisoning. A state-owned petrochemical plant in the northeast spills benzene, making water nearby undrinkable.

""China is dangerously near a crisis point"" with its environment, writes Pan Yue, the outspoken vice minister of China's State Environmental Protection Administration, in a commentary published last month. A third of China's people drink substandard water, and a third breathe badly polluted air, according to Mr. Pan. ""True, China has made the kind of economic advances in three decades that required 100 years in Western countries. But China has also suffered a century's worth of environmental damage in 30 years,"" Mr. Pan wrote.

Yet when SEPA goes to shutter waste-spilling plants, often at the behest of nearby residents, it is regularly thwarted by local officials intent on keeping local factories cranking -- and often lining their own pockets.

In many advanced economies, social tensions find some release in democratic elections that allow the aggrieved to oust unpopular or corrupt leaders. China has so far steadfastly avoided that approach. It is instead struggling to find other ways to keep its vast bureaucracy and increasingly unruly businesses in line.

Few people think these trends pose an imminent threat to the Communist Party's hold on power. But incidents of public protest, sometimes violent, are on the rise, officials say. More immediately, there are economic costs that result from the disjunctures, and these could imperil the continued progress of China's economic reforms. No longer able to rely on state health or pension programs, many Chinese citizens are banking large chunks of their income to pay their own way. That robust savings is slowing China's shift to a domestic-consumption-led economy, and therefore is likely to keep exports high, and big Chinese trade surpluses a source of international tensions.

SEPA, the environmental agency, meanwhile, estimated in a September report that the cost to clean up pollution produced in 2004 alone would equal about 3% of China's economic output that year a hefty price tag. Mr. Pan, the vice minister, believes the number is actually much higher.

China's leaders in the past three decades have engineered one of the most remarkable economic transformations in human history. And yet today the country faces tests borne of that progress that are in some ways trickier than those it has already overcome. A nation that started out railing against capitalism now embodies many of its most extreme elements. Like other industrializing economies, it must find ways to guide national ambitions, so they don't ultimately undercut the national interest. "
138,WSJ,Staff,2007,China Capitalism,"On the edge of this dusty farming hamlet, the massive smokestack of the half-finished Xinfeng Power Plant looms as a monument to China's out-of-control demand for energy.

Unlike two other power plants nearby, Xinfeng isn't supposed to exist. China's electricity regulators never authorized the $362 million coal-burning plant. But in 2004, the provincial government here in northern China's Inner Mongolia ignored Beijing's call to slow down investment and started building the plant anyway, hoping to ensure enough juice for the region's supercharged industrialization by tapping its rich reservoirs of coal.

Inner Mongolia's disobedience might have escaped notice. But in July 2005, in the rush to finish the plant before regulators found out about it, the housing for a turbine collapsed, killing six workers. During the yearlong investigation that followed, the central government discovered that Inner Mongolia had illegally built about 10 power plants, or 8.6 gigawatts of electricity-generating capacity -- equal to about a 10th of the United Kingdom's total capacity.

The illegal plants have had unintended -- and detrimental -- consequences. By eschewing even basic environmental safeguards, they stand out as polluters even in an industry that is one of China's leading sources of emissions, officials say. They also have driven up the demand for and price of coal, the country's most abundant source of fuel. That, in turn, has spawned thousands of illegal coal mines that have contributed to more than 4,000 coal-mining deaths in China this year.

The illegal power plants show how China's economic transformation is outpacing Beijing's ability to manage it. Never before has a country with such a big population grown as rapidly as China. The country's economy has expanded an average 10% a year since the late 1970s. The process of economic modernization is happening twice as fast in China as it did in the U.S. or Japan, where it took half a century or more.

One fifth of the power plants in China are illegal, according to government estimates -- enough to light up all of the U.K. While the electricity they supply is essential to power China's growth, the uncontrolled manner in which they are multiplying, often under the protection of local authorities, poses a challenge to Beijing's authority and its grip on energy policy.

""It is impossible for our central government to go everywhere to see, when the small power plants start building,"" said Zhang Guobao, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top energy policy planner, in an interview.

The central government is likewise finding it hard to crack down on illegal coal mines. In past years it has shut down thousands of mines -- only to see thousands more spring up in their place. The primary reason: the soaring profits to be made from selling coal to China's power plants are a powerful temptation. Many regions have embraced coal mining to boost their growth rates, including Inner Mongolia, one of China's most coal-rich provinces.

Infuriated by the illegal Xinfeng power plant, central-government officials earlier this year demanded that the province's top leadership present self-criticisms before China's powerful State Council, or cabinet. Under China's Communist system, that's an unusually public form of rebuke, designed to send a message to others against defying Beijing's will.

Even so, construction continues today at the Xinfeng plant nearly a year after Beijing ordered it stopped. Officials at the company building the plant say they expect to get approval to complete it ""sooner or later.""

In China, more power plants almost invariably mean more coal consumption. The country has been unable to diversify away from coal, which is cheaper than alternative fuels, some of which are imported.

But China's coal consumption is costly in human and environmental terms. Amid the push to feed the country's power plants last year, 5,938 coal miners were killed in accidents, mostly in smaller, illegal mines. Such accidents are so commonplace here that only the larger ones rank as news.

Coal is one of the biggest pollution sources in China, which some experts think is on the verge of an environmental crisis. This year, the central government set a target of reducing the amount of energy the country consumes relative to its economic output. But the soaring demand for coal-fueled electricity has upended Beijing's efforts to rein in pollution.

""It will be very difficult to realize our targets of saving energy and reducing pollution,"" Ma Kai, China's top economic policy planner, said this fall.

The implications of China's mushrooming hunger for energy go far beyond its own borders. As incomes rise in China, energy use per person is starting to catch up with the richer West. The typical American consumes about eight metric tons of oil a year, or its equivalent in coal and other fuels. Japanese consume about half that sum. In China, per capita energy consumption now stands at just 1.2 metric tons.

It would require a doubling of world oil production -- an impossible feat -- for every Chinese to live the energy-intensive lifestyle of an American, as well as more coal than some believe China could ever dig up.

""We can't copy the big home and the big car"" that so many Americans enjoy, said Zhou Dadi, a top researcher with the Energy Research Institute, a government-backed think tank. ""It's just not doable.""

China's current energy predicament is rooted in the decision it made three decades ago when it began to embrace a market economy. For the first 20 years of its transition, as China shifted from a mostly agrarian country to light industry, it was able to quadruple the size of its economy while only doubling its energy needs.

Throughout the 1990s, however, a new and faster phase of expansion quietly took hold as the government loosened restrictions on investment and the mobility of its citizens, accelerating China's industrialization and urbanization. Manufacturing accounted for a steadily greater share of the economy. Energy-intensive heavy industries boomed, from petrochemicals to auto production, aided by China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.

Low energy prices, made possible in part by government controls, encouraged consumers to use more. Coal consumption initially crept up slowly, to around 1.5 billion metric tons a year in the mid-1990s, from just under one billion metric tons a year a decade earlier. Last year, however, China consumed about 2.2 billion metric tons of coal, one-third of the world's total and more than any other country.

Beijing's efforts to reduce reliance on coal have largely failed. China has plenty of coal -- an estimated 114.5 billion metric tons of recoverable reserves. Only the U.S. and Russia have more. Natural gas, which burns more efficiently and causes far less pollution, has proved too expensive to compete effectively. Planned increases in nuclear-power production would fill only a fraction of China's energy demand. Even China's more-ambitious plans for hydropower power and wind farms won't seriously challenge coal's dominance.

Coal miners are on the front lines of the battle to meet China's energy needs. It is dangerous work. As with power plants, China's government has had great difficulty regulating coal mines. In the U.S., which produces about half as much coal as China, 47 miners have been killed so far this year, up from 22 last year. In China, the number of deaths has declined slightly this year, but it is still enormous: 4,236 dead so far.

The number of casualties goes up in the winter. More than 400 miners died in November alone. ""In winter, demand goes up, the market prices go up, and the profit motive goes up,"" said Huang Yi, spokesman for the State Administration of Worker Safety, the agency that investigates mine accidents.

Smaller, often inefficient, and dangerous mines account for about a third of China's coal production. They are so important to meeting its energy needs that the central government recently delayed plans to improve safety by shuttering many of them.

Whole regions of China are pockmarked with tiny, illegal mines like the one in Wangyu in central China's gritty Shanxi province, where an accident in early November killed 34 miners. Four tons of demolition explosives illegally stored in a shaft caught fire and destroyed the small mine, according to government safety officials. The dead, who had just started the night shift, were mostly from the same village some 250 miles away.

Wang Chenliang, from Sichuan province, had just ended his shift when the explosion occurred. He rushed back to help with rescue efforts. He and others pulled survivors from the wreckage and pumped air into the mine to aid anyone who was trapped but still alive.

""This work is tiring and dangerous,"" Mr. Wang said a few days after the accident, only moments before police detained a journalist attempting to interview survivors. Like others, he got his job through introductions from fellow villagers. ""We came here to earn money. The money here is much higher than back home in Sichuan.""

The mine's safety certificate and production permit had both expired, according to central-government officials. But the local government was protecting it, they said, because it held a financial interest in the mine.

That sort of corruption is common. Last year, the central government found that more than 4,500 government officials illegally held stakes in coal mines and frequently covered up safety violations. Many of these mines lack basic safety equipment. Workers scrabble down narrow pits, where the most modern tools may be the sticks of dynamite used to dislodge the coal. At the accident site in Wangyu, there was no rescue equipment on hand, another common problem.

Over the past few years, provincial officials in Inner Mongolia have decided to build power plants and encourage heavy industry to relocate to the region to take advantage of its coal resources. The strategy has paid off in economic terms.

Last year, the province's economy grew 21.6%, roughly double the national rate. In 2004, it grew 19.4%. Industrial output has grown an average 30% a year over the past four years. Such unbridled growth caught China's central government off guard.

In 2003 and 2004, massive power shortages in the south led to rolling blackouts. Local authorities across China decided to build power plants, often illegally, to keep their local economies humming. Around that time, officials in Inner Mongolia approved a plan to build the Xinfeng Power Plant in the small town of Fengzhen, in a bid to attract more factories.

""Inner Mongolia has a lot of coal. Other parts of China need the electricity. Of course Inner Mongolia should take advantage of its natural resources,"" said Yan Keji, a construction worker at one of the three power plants near Jubao.

It isn't just heavy industry that needs power. China's consumers are using more, too. Mr. Yan's hometown in the mountains of Hunan didn't have electricity until 1990. At first, his house had one light bulb. Now, the money he earns from construction has paid for a television, washing machine, refrigerator and air conditioning, a pattern repeated in millions of homes across China as people get richer.

China's sprawling cities are also driving up power demand. Inner Mongolia now provides Beijing with 20% of its electricity, according to Jim Brock, an independent energy consultant in the Chinese capital.

Nearly two years ago, China's central government started cracking down on the unauthorized power plants because they feared a surplus of power. In Inner Mongolia, local officials ignored orders to stop building the Xingfeng plant, figuring they could always get retroactive approval, according to the official Xinhua news agency. But the death of the six workers in July 2005 set in motion the investigation that culminated in the public castigation of the provincial chief and the order to stop work on Xinfeng.

Some construction work on the plant continues. Workers interviewed at the site said the plant would be able to produce electricity next year. They declined to give their names.

Na Guiting, an official at Inner Mongolia Energy Generation Investment Co. Ltd., the plant's owner, said the company is eager to finish building and has reapplied for approval. ""Mongolia still has a very serious power shortage. If Xinfeng would be approved, it could be generating in three or four months,"" the official said. "
139,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"On the afternoon of July 8, 2006, four private security guards rolled out of Baghdad's Green Zone in an armored SUV. The team leader, Jacob C. Washbourne, rode in the front passenger seat. He seemed in a good mood. His vacation started the next day.

""I want to kill somebody today,"" Washbourne said, according to the three other men in the vehicle, who later recalled it as an offhand remark. Before the day was over, however, the guards had been involved in three shooting incidents. In one, Washbourne allegedly fired into the windshield of a taxi for amusement, according to interviews and statements from the three other guards.

Washbourne, a 29-year-old former Marine, denied the allegations. ""They're all unfounded, unbased, and they simply did not happen,"" he said during an interview near his home in Broken Arrow, Okla.

The full story of what happened on Baghdad's airport road that day may never be known. But a Washington Post investigation of the incidents provides a rare look inside the world of private security contractors, the hired guns who fight a parallel and largely hidden war in Iraq. The contractors face the same dangers as the military, but many come to the war for big money, and they operate outside most of the laws that govern American forces.

The U.S. military has brought charges against dozens of soldiers and Marines in Iraq, including 64 servicemen linked to murders. Not a single case has been brought against a security contractor, and confusion is widespread among contractors and the military over what laws, if any, apply to their conduct. The Pentagon estimates that at least 20,000 security contractors work in Iraq, the size of an additional division.

Private contractors were granted immunity from the Iraqi legal process in 2004 by L. Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S. occupation government. More recently, the military and Congress have moved to establish guidelines for prosecuting contractors under U.S. law or the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but so far the issue remains unresolved.

The only known inquiry into the July 8 incidents was conducted by Triple Canopy, a 3 1/2 -year-old company founded by retired Special Forces officers and based in Herndon. Triple Canopy employed the four guards. After the one-week probe, the company concluded that three questionable shooting incidents had occurred that day and fired Washbourne and two other employees, Shane B. Schmidt and Charles L. Sheppard III.

Lee A. Van Arsdale, Triple Canopy's chief executive officer, said the three men failed to report the shootings immediately, a violation of company policy and local Defense Department requirements for reporting incidents. He said Triple Canopy was unable to determine the circumstances behind the shootings, especially since no deaths or injuries were recorded by U.S. or Iraqi authorities.

""You have to assume that, if someone engages, he is following the rules and that he did feel a threat,"" Van Arsdale said, adding that conflicting accounts, delays in reporting the incidents and lack of evidence made it impossible to determine exactly what provoked the shootings. Triple Canopy officials said they have lobbied for more regulation of contractors since 2004 to better define how incidents such as the July 8 shootings are reported and investigated.

Many details about the shootings are in dispute. This account is based on company after-action reports and other documents, court filings, and interviews with current and former Triple Canopy employees, including all four men riding in the armored Chevrolet Suburban that day.

Schmidt and Sheppard said they were horrified by what they described as a shooting rampage by Washbourne and waited two days to come forward because they feared for their jobs and their lives. The two have sued Triple Canopy in Fairfax County Circuit Court, arguing that the company fired them for reporting a crime.

But another man in the vehicle, Fijian army veteran Isireli Naucukidi, said Sheppard, who was driving, cut off the taxi on Washbourne's orders, giving him a better shot. Naucukidi said the three American guards laughed as they sped away, the fate of the Iraqi taxi driver unknown. Schmidt told Washbourne, ""Nice shot,"" according to Naucukidi.

Naucukidi also said that Schmidt was responsible for an earlier shooting incident that afternoon involving a white civilian truck, and that he believed Schmidt and Sheppard had blamed Washbourne to cover up their own potential culpability. Schmidt denied responsibility for that shooting but acknowledged in an interview he had fired a warning shot into the grille of a car on a separate airport run that morning and had failed to report it.

Naucukidi left Triple Canopy on his own shortly after the incidents occurred. Company officials said he was not fired because, unlike the three other guards, he had reported the shootings immediately. During an interview on the Fijian island of Ovalau, where he farms, Naucukidi said he decided not to return to Triple Canopy because ""I couldn't stand what was happening. It seemed like every day they were covering something"" up.

The presence of heavily armed guards on the battlefield has long been a wild card in the Iraq war. Insurgents frequently attack them. Iraqi civilians have expressed fear of their sometimes heavy-handed tactics, which have included running vehicles off the road and firing indiscriminately to ward off attacks.

Current and former Triple Canopy employees said they policed themselves in Iraq under an informal system they frequently referred to as ""big boy rules.""

""We never knew if we fell under military law, American law, Iraqi law, or whatever,"" Sheppard said. ""We were always told, from the very beginning, if for some reason something happened and the Iraqis were trying to prosecute us, they would put you in the back of a car and sneak you out of the country in the middle of the night.""

Naucukidi said the American contractors had their own motto: ""What happens here today, stays here today.""

June 2: Hilla
Washbourne sported a shaved head, a goatee and a mosaic of tattoos and piercings on his muscular, 6-foot-3-inch frame. He led one of two teams on Triple Canopy's ""Milwaukee"" project, a contract to protect executives of KBR Inc., a Halliburton subsidiary, on Iraq's dangerous roads. He earned $600 a day commanding a small unit of guards armed with M-4 rifles and 9mm pistols, the same caliber weapons used by U.S. troops.

The men referred to each other by their radio call signs. Washbourne was ""JW,"" his initials. Sheppard, a former U.S. Army Ranger, was ""Shrek,"" for his resemblance to the cartoon monster. Schmidt, a former Marine sniper, was ""Happy,"" an ironic reference to his surly demeanor. Naucukidi was ""Isi,"" an abbreviation of his first name.

Schmidt and Sheppard earned $500 a day. Naucukidi earned $70 a day for the same work.

One of the largest security firms in Iraq, Triple Canopy was known for its elite, disciplined guards, including many Special Operations veterans from all branches of service. The company provides security at some checkpoints inside Baghdad's Green Zone. But Triple Canopy officials said the company is not responsible for protecting the Iraqi parliament building, where a bomb Thursday killed at least one person and wounded at least 20.

On the Milwaukee project, Washbourne came to symbolize a lack of discipline that was a departure from the company's approach, according to several current and former employees.

Unlike the U.S. military, which prohibits drinking, Triple Canopy employees ran their own bar, called the Gem, inside the Green Zone. Washbourne sometimes drank so heavily his subordinates had to roust him for his own operations briefings, four current and former employees said. Washbourne said he drank, but seldom to excess.

An incident a month before the shootings underscored doubts among his colleagues about Washbourne's leadership, several of them said. On June 2, Washbourne was leading a convoy to a State Department compound in Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. The Suburban in which he was a passenger jumped a curb at a high rate of speed, shattering the axles and halting the exposed SUV in the middle of the highway.

A blue civilian truck suddenly flew around a blind curve and headed toward the convoy, according to Washbourne and Naucukidi, who was riding with him that day. Washbourne fired more than a dozen rounds into the oncoming truck with his M-4, wounding the driver. He later said he felt threatened. Washbourne then insisted on torching his damaged SUV with incendiary grenades instead of having it towed.

Washbourne said he was following standard operating procedure, which calls for a vehicle to be destroyed once it is disabled to prevent it from falling into the hands of insurgents.

Naucukidi said Washbourne ordered the guards to tell investigators that the convoy had been attacked by insurgents, even though many of them believed it had merely been involved in a traffic accident. Washbourne insisted that a small explosion precipitated the incident and that the SUV had been run off the road by another vehicle.

When the team returned to Baghdad, Naucukidi said, it was met by Ryan D. Thomason, a close friend of Washbourne's who was serving as acting project manager.

""What happens here today, stays here today,"" Thomason said, according to Naucukidi. ""Good job, boys.""

Thomason instructed the team not to discuss the incident for security reasons, said his attorney, Michael E. Schwartz. Triple Canopy recently opened a separate investigation into the incident after new information about it surfaced during litigation over the July 8 shootings.

July 8: Baghdad Airport
The July 8 afternoon run was to be Washbourne's last before he returned to Oklahoma. The team was to travel to Baghdad International Airport to pick up a client, then return to the Green Zone.

Washbourne, as team leader, led a pre-mission briefing in the parking lot. As the briefing concluded, according to Naucukidi, Washbourne cocked his M-4 and said, ""I want to kill somebody today.""

Naucukidi said he asked why. He recalled that Washbourne replied: ""Because I'm going on vacation tomorrow. That's a long time, buddy.""

In an incident report that he later submitted to Triple Canopy, Sheppard wrote that Washbourne also informed him that he was ""going to kill someone today."" In an interview, Schmidt said he heard a similar remark. Washbourne denied making any comment about his hope or intention to kill that day.

Naucukidi said he didn't take the comment seriously, because Washbourne frequently made similar jokes. ""He did this really every mission: 'Okay, let's go shoot somebody,'"" Naucukidi said.

Washbourne sat in the front passenger seat of the ""follow"" vehicle -- the third Suburban in a three-truck convoy, which included a lead vehicle, filled with guards, and what they called the ""limo,"" a Suburban used to ferry the client. Sheppard drove. Schmidt and Naucukidi sat behind them facing backward to protect against a rear attack.

The four men agree on what happened next. The convoy arrived at Checkpoint 1, just outside the airport, and set up a blocking position to allow the lead vehicle and the ""limo"" to proceed through the checkpoint. The contractors noticed a small white pickup truck moving up slowly behind them from a distance of about 200 yards.

At this point, the stories diverge.

Naucukidi said Sheppard moved the Suburban to give Schmidt a better view. Naucukidi said that he and Schmidt tried to warn the white truck to stop but that it was still moving forward when Schmidt fired three times with his M-4. He said the truck stopped immediately but was still too far away for the men to see where the bullets hit.

Naucukidi also said the truck was too far away and was moving too slowly to pose a threat.

Schmidt and Sheppard waited two days before coming forward, then gave nearly identical accounts of what happened. Both said that it was Washbourne who shot at the white truck and that he fired intentionally into the windshield. ""His intention was to kill,"" said Schmidt, who claimed he saw a ""splash"" of glass from the bullets striking the windshield.

Schmidt and Sheppard said Washbourne warned them not to mention the incident, quoting him as saying, ""That didn't happen, understand?""

Washbourne said he only recalled firing two warning shots at a much larger white truck in an incident during a different run that morning. Naucukidi said he believes Washbourne is confusing that shooting with yet another incident that had occurred at the same location a few days earlier.

""There was no comments about 'That didn't happen, you understand,' or anything,"" Washbourne said.

""I am not a clever or witty man; I don't say things like that,"" he said. ""And I'm not a morbid or sadistic"" person.

July 8: Route Irish
The convoy continued through the checkpoint to pick up the KBR executive at the airport. It then left the airport and began the return trip.

Sheppard wrote that he observed ""an Ambulance and a lot of activity"" where the shooting had taken place. He and Schmidt said Washbourne threatened them again not to say anything.

Washbourne denied making any threats and said no ambulance was parked near the checkpoint. Naucukidi also said he did not see an ambulance.

The convoy continued down the airport road, called Route Irish by the military and contractors, toward the Green Zone. It reached speeds of 80 miles per hour.

Schmidt, Sheppard and Naucukidi agree that the convoy then came upon a taxi.

According to the accounts of Schmidt and Sheppard, Washbourne remarked, ""I've never shot anyone with my pistol before."" As the Suburban passed on the left, Washbourne pushed open the armored door, leaned out with his handgun and fired ""7 or 8 rounds"" into the taxi's windshield, both wrote in their statements.

Schmidt wrote: ""From my position as we passed I could see the taxi had been hit in the windshield, due to the Spidering of the glass and the pace we were travelling, I could not tell if the driver had been hit, He did pull the car off the road in an erratic manner.""

Sheppard said Washbourne was ""laughing"" as he fired.

Washbourne called their accounts ""an absolute, total fabrication."" He said the Suburban's high rate of speed and the wind resistance would have made the shooting ""physically impossible.""

""There's not an ounce of truth in it. It did not happen,"" Washbourne said angrily. ""And as far as the statement goes where I said, 'I've never shot anyone with my pistol,' that is a lie. It was never one time said.""

Naucukidi said that Washbourne fired at the taxi with his M-4 and that he ordered Sheppard to cut off the taxi beforehand. Naucukidi said Sheppard followed the order and used the Suburban to slow down the taxi and give Washbourne a better position to shoot from.

""When we were slightly ahead, JW just opened his door and started shooting the taxi from where we were sitting,"" Naucukidi said in an interview.

Naucukidi described the taxi driver as a 60- to 70-year-old man. He said he saw one hole in the taxi's windshield but could not tell if the driver had been hit. He said the taxi abruptly stopped.

""From my point of view, this old man, he was so innocent, because he was ahead of us with a normal speed,"" Naucukidi said. ""He couldn't have any danger for us.""

Sheppard sped away to catch up to the rest of the convoy, according to Naucukidi, who added that the three Americans were laughing and that Schmidt reached over, tapped Washbourne on the shoulder and told him, ""Nice shot.""

""They felt that it was so funny,"" Naucukidi said.

Schmidt denied that he complimented Washbourne. ""No, I don't get a thrill out of killing innocent people,"" he said. ""That was a moment of shame.""

Divergent Reports
When the convoy returned to the Green Zone, members of the team scattered.

Naucukidi said he immediately told his supervisor, Jona Masirewa, who served as a liaison between the Fijian contractors and the Americans, about the incidents. He said Masirewa instructed him to write up a report to use in case an investigation occurred.

Naucukidi wrote the one-page report on his laptop. It contained brief summaries of the two afternoon shootings.

Of the first incident, near the airport checkpoint, Naucukidi wrote that the white truck was approaching slowly and was 200 meters away when Schmidt opened fire: ""Happy shot three (3) rounds from his M4 rifle, and the white bongo truck stopped.""

In the second incident, Naucukidi wrote, the Suburban ""over took one white taxi with an Iraqi single pack,"" or passenger. He wrote that ""our team leader opened his door and fired three rounds at white taxi.""

But Naucukidi said Masirewa feared losing his job and did not immediately turn over the report. ""It was a difficult thing for us because we are TCNs,"" or third-country nationals, ""and they are expats,"" Naucukidi said. ""They are team leaders, and they make commands and reports on us. And the team leaders were always saying, 'What happens today, stays today,' and if something like that happens, the team leaders, they start covering each other up.""

Masirewa, who is still employed by Triple Canopy in Iraq, did not return e-mails seeking comment.

By the time Washbourne went on vacation the following day, Schmidt and Sheppard had not reported the incidents. Schmidt said he was concerned about ""catching a bullet in the head."" Sheppard said he was so shaken he spent the night at another location inside the Green Zone.

But other employees did not believe that Schmidt and Sheppard feared for their safety. Rather, they said, the two men feared for their high-paying jobs and believed that Thomason, the assistant project manager, would throw his support behind Washbourne, his close friend.

On July 10, two days after the incidents on the airport run, Sheppard finally went to Asa Esslinger, another supervisor, and reported them to Triple Canopy management. 'Just a Rampant Day'

On July 12, back home in Oklahoma, Washbourne received a call on his cellphone from Triple Canopy's country manager, Kelvin Kai, he recalled later.

Washbourne said Kai asked him if he remembered any shooting incidents July 8. Washbourne said he told Kai that he had forgotten to file written reports. He said he rushed to his apartment from a Tulsa pizza restaurant and sent in the reports from his laptop.

Two hours later, Kai called again from Baghdad. ""He said that allegations were made that it was just a rampant day, is I believe what he called it, of shooting and mayhem,"" Washbourne recalled. ""I said, 'No, boss, you got those two reports.' ""

Kai could not be reached for comment. Triple Canopy declined to make him available, citing the ongoing lawsuit.

The following day, Triple Canopy suspended Schmidt and Sheppard pending an internal investigation. No action was immediately taken against Washbourne because he was home on leave, according to the company.

""It is essential that we have your complete cooperation in reporting the facts and circumstances of all the activities not only to Triple Canopy but also to officials from DoD and KBR if necessary,"" wrote Tony Nicholson, a Triple Canopy vice president, in letters to Schmidt and Sheppard.

Triple Canopy said it took statements from 30 potential witnesses forits internal probe. One week later, the three guards were informed by Raymond P. Randall, a senior vice president of Triple Canopy, that they had been fired.

""I am personally disappointed that you failed to immediately recognize the seriousness of this breach of operating procedures and its potential impact on the company's reputation,"" Randall wrote.

The terminations did not preclude the possibility of future investigations by the military, Randall wrote.

Van Arsdale, a retired colonel in the Army's Delta Force and a winner of the Silver Star, said Triple Canopy reported the incidents to KBR and to military officials in the Green Zone. Triple Canopy officials said that because of the seriousness of the allegations, they expected that the military would conduct a separate investigation to determine whether further action was warranted.

Lt. Col. Michael J. Hartig, the former director of security for the Green Zone, said Triple Canopy officials approached him in his office but did not specify the allegations. ""They mentioned they had a couple guys do some things that were questionable on the road, and that was pretty much it,"" he said.

Hartig said he informed Triple Canopy that such incidents were ""out of my venue."" He said he referred the company to the Joint Contracting Command for Iraq and Afghanistan, which administers contracts. ""I didn't want to get involved in this because I had enough going on in my life,"" Hartig said. ""It was like, 'Here's the point of contact. Have a nice day.'""

Two military spokespeople said they were unaware of any investigations into the shootings. Maj. David W. Small, a spokesman for the United States Central Command, which oversees Iraq, said: ""This is not a Centcom issue. It's whoever was running that contract.""

""We're fighting a war here,"" Small said."
140,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"Private security companies, funded by billions of dollars in U.S. military and State Department contracts, are fighting insurgents on a widening scale in Iraq, enduring daily attacks, returning fire and taking hundreds of casualties that have been underreported and sometimes concealed, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials and company representatives.

While the military has built up troops in an ongoing campaign to secure Baghdad, the security companies, out of public view, have been engaged in a parallel surge, boosting manpower, adding expensive armor and stepping up evasive action as attacks increase, the officials and company representatives said. One in seven supply convoys protected by private forces has come under attack this year, according to previously unreleased statistics; one security company reported nearly 300 ""hostile actions"" in the first four months.

The majority of the more than 100 security companies operate outside of Iraqi law, in part because of bureaucratic delays and corruption in the Iraqi government licensing process, according to U.S. officials. Blackwater USA, a prominent North Carolina firm that protects U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, and several other companies have not applied, U.S. and Iraqi officials said. Blackwater said that it obtained a one-year license in 2005 but that shifting Iraqi government policy has impeded its attempts to renew.

The security industry's enormous growth has been facilitated by the U.S. military, which uses the 20,000 to 30,000 contractors to offset chronic troop shortages. Armed contractors protect all convoys transporting reconstruction materiel, including vehicles, weapons and ammunition for the Iraqi army and police. They guard key U.S. military installations and provide personal security for at least three commanding generals, including Air Force Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Scott, who oversees U.S. military contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""I'm kind of practicing what I preach here,"" Scott said in an interview on the use of private security forces for such tasks. ""I'm a two-star general, but I'm not the most important guy in the multinational force. If it's a lower-priority mission and it's within the capabilities of private security, this is an appropriate risk rade-off.""



The military plans to outsource at least $1.5 billion in security operations this year, including the three largest security contracts in Iraq: a ""theaterwide"" contract to protect U.S. bases that is worth up to $480 million, according to Scott; a contract for up to $475 million to provide intelligence for the Army and personal security for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and a contract for up to $450 million to protect reconstruction convoys. The Army has also tested a plan to use private security on military convoys for the first time, a shift that would significantly increase the presence of armed contractors on Iraq's dangerous roads.

""The whole face of private security changed with Iraq, and it will never go back to how it was,"" said Leon Sharon, a retired Special Operations officer who commands 500 private Kurdish guards at an immense warehouse transit point for weapons, ammunition and other materiel on the outskirts of Baghdad.

U.S. officials and security company representatives emphasized that contractors are strictly limited to defensive operations. But company representatives in the field said insurgents rarely distinguish between the military and private forces, drawing the contractors into a bloody and escalating campaign.

The U.S. military has never released complete statistics on contractor casualties or the number of attacks on privately guarded convoys. The military deleted casualty figures from reports issued by the Reconstruction Logistics Directorate of the Corps of Engineers, according to Victoria Wayne, who served as deputy director for logistics until 2006 and spent 2 1/2 years in Iraq.

Wayne described security contractors as ""the unsung heroes of the war."" She said she believed the military wanted to hide information showing that private guards were fighting and dying in large numbers because it would be perceived as bad news.

""It was like there was a major war being fought out there, but we were the only ones who knew about it,"" Wayne said.

After a year of protests by Wayne and logistics director Jack Holly, a retired Marine colonel, the casualty figures were included. In an operational overview updated last month, the logistics directorate reported that 132 security contractors and truck drivers had been killed and 416 wounded since fall 2004. Four security contractors and a truck driver remained missing, and 208 vehicles were destroyed. Only convoys registered with the logistics directorate are counted in the statistics, and the total number of casualties is believed to be higher.

""When you see the number of my people who have been killed, the American public should recognize that every one of them represents an American soldier or Marine or sailor who didn't have to go in harm's way,"" Holly said in an interview.

According to the logistics directorate, attacks against registered supply convoys rose from 5.4 percent in 2005, to 9.1 percent in 2006, to 14.7 percent through May 10. The directorate has tracked 12,860 convoys, a fraction of the total number of private supply convoys on Iraqi roads.

""The military are very conscious that we're in their battle space,"" said Cameron Simpson, country operations manager for ArmorGroup International, a British firm that protects 32 percent of all nonmilitary supply convoys in Iraq. ""We would never launch into an offensive operation, but when you're co-located, you're all one team, really.""

ArmorGroup, which started in Iraq with 20 employees and a handful of SUVs, has grown to a force of 1,200 -- the equivalent of nearly two battalions -- with 240 armored trucks; nearly half of the publicly traded company's $273.5 million in revenue last year came from Iraq. Globally, ArmorGroup employs 9,000 people in 38 countries.

The company, with headquarters at a complex of sandstone villas near Baghdad's Green Zone, is acquiring a fleet of $200,000 tactical armored vehicles equipped with two gun hatches and able to withstand armor-piercing bullets and some of the largest roadside bombs.

The U.S. Labor Department reported that ArmorGroup has lost 26 employees in Iraq, based on insurance claims. Sources close to the company said the figure is nearly 30. Only three countries in the 25-nation coalition -- the United States, Britain and Italy -- have sustained more combat-related deaths.

A Turning Point
In spring 2004, Holly built the logistics network for Iraq's reconstruction from scratch. The network delivered 31,100 vehicles, 451,000 weapons and 410 million rounds of ammunition to the new Iraqi security forces, and items as varied as computers, baby incubators, school desks and mattresses for every Iraqi government ministry. The network came to rival the military's own logistics operation.

Holly also discovered he was at the center of an undeclared war.

He assembled a small private army to protect materiel as it flowed from border crossings and a southern port at Umm Qasr to the 650,000-square-foot warehouse complex at Abu Ghraib and on to its final destination.

""The only way anything gets to you here is if somebody bets their life on its delivery,"" said Holly, a burly civilian with a trimmed gray beard who strikes a commanding presence even in khakis, multicolored checked shirts and tennis shoes. ""That's the fundamental issue: Nothing moves anywhere in Iraq without betting your life.""

The most dangerous link in Holly's supply chain is shipping. It requires the slow-moving convoys to navigate Iraq's dangerous roads. Holly erected a ground-traffic control center in a low-slung trailer near his office in Baghdad's Green Zone. The security companies monitor their convoys in air-conditioned silence, which is shattered by a jarring klaxon each time a contractor pushes a dashboard ""panic button,"" signaling a possible attack.

On May 8, 2005, after dropping off a load that included T-shirts, plastic whistles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition for Iraqi police, one of Holly's convoys was attacked. Of 20 security contractors and truck drivers, 13 were killed or listed as missing; five of the seven survivors were wounded. Insurgents booby-trapped four of the bodies. To eliminate the threat, a military recovery team fired a tank round into a pile of corpses, according to an after-action report.

The convoy had been protected by Hart Security, a British firm that used unarmored vehicles. Within a month, another Hart-led convoy was hit. The team leader informed the ground-control center by cellphone that he was running out of ammunition. He left the cellphone on as his convoy was overrun.

""We listened to the bad guys for almost an hour after they finished everybody off,"" Holly said.

The attacks represented a turning point in the private war.

Holly vowed he would never again use unarmored vehicles for convoy protection. He went to his primary shipper, Public Warehousing Co. of Kuwait, and ordered a change. PWC hired ArmorGroup, which had armed Ford F-350 pickups with steel-reinforced gun turrets and belt-fed machine guns.

Other companies followed suit, ramping up production of an array of armored and semi-armored trucks of various styles and colors, until Iraq's supply routes resembled the post-apocalyptic world of the ""Mad Max"" movies. Bolstered Tactics, Armor

ArmorGroup started in Iraq in 2003 with four security teams and 20 employees. It now has 30 mechanics to support its ground operation. ""It's a monster,"" said Simpson, the country operations manager, strolling past a truck blown apart by a roadside bomb.

ArmorGroup operates 10 convoy security teams in support of Holly's logistics operation. The company runs another 10 to 15 under a half-dozen contracts, as well as for clients who request security on a case-by-case basis, Simpson said.

The company charges $8,000 to $12,000 a day, according to sources familiar with the pricing, although the cost can vary depending on convoy size and the risk. For security reasons, the convoys are limited to 10 tractor-trailers protected by at least four armored trucks filled with 20 guards: four Western vehicle commanders with M-21 assault rifles and 9mm Glock pistols, and 16 Iraqis with AK-47s.

The Western contractors, most with at least 10 years' experience, are paid about $135,000, the same as a U.S. Army two-star general. The Iraqis receive about a tenth of that.

""Every time I think about how it was at the beginning, arriving here with a suitcase and $1,000, and there was no one else around, it's just incredible,"" Simpson said. ""Nobody envisioned that private security companies would be openly targeted by insurgents.""

ArmorGroup prides itself on a low-key approach to security. Its well-groomed guards travel in khakis and dark blue shirts. The company's armored trucks are adorned with stickers issued by the Interior Ministry, where the company is fully licensed. Holly's former deputy, Victoria Wayne, said ArmorGroup turned down an opportunity to use more powerful weaponry as the insurgent threat increased.

""As a publicly traded company, they didn't want to be perceived as a mercenary force,"" she said.

But the company is under constant attack. ArmorGroup ran 1,184 convoys in Iraq in 2006; it reported 450 hostile actions, mostly roadside bombs, small-arms fire and mortar attacks. The company was attacked 293 times in the first four months of 2007, according to ArmorGroup statistics. On the dangerous roads north of Baghdad, ""you generally attract at least one incident every mission,"" Simpson said.

Allan Campion, 36, who joined ArmorGroup after 18 years in the British infantry, said one of his convoys was recently attacked three times on a two-mile stretch outside Baghdad. One bomb exploded near the team leader's vehicle, but the convoy managed to continue, he said. Within minutes, another bomb exploded, followed by small-arms fire.

A firefight ensued as the convoy continued through the ""kill zone,"" Campion said.

""We were still moving, so whether you've hit anybody or not, it's very hard to say,"" he said.

With the insurgents employing more-lethal roadside bombs, ArmorGroup has responded by changing tactics and spending $6.8 million to bolster its armor. Its new armored ""Rock"" vehicles are built on Ford F-550 chassis and are favored by ArmorGroup because of a V-shaped hull that provides better protection against roadside bombs.

Chris Berman, a former Navy SEAL who helped design the Rock for North Carolina-based Granite Tactical Vehicles, said its main deterrent is its twin gun hatches. ""That gives you twice as much firepower,"" Berman said. ""With two belt-fed machine guns in there, that's enough to chew up most people.""

'Caught Up in the Mix'
Built on the site of a former Iraqi tank factory, the Abu Ghraib warehouse complex is known variously as Fort Apache, the Isle of Abu and Rocket City, a reference to when rockets and mortars frequently rained down on the compound.

The bleak, windswept facility consists of 64 buildings spread over a 1 1/2 -mile-long and half-mile-wide area; employees of Public Warehousing (now Agility) -- barricaded inside the fortress -- installed a driving range and a small fishing pond for entertainment. The perimeter is protected by double blast walls, guard towers equipped with belt-fed Dushka machine guns and uniformed Kurdish guards who answer to a military-style rank structure and carry AK-47 assault rifles.

Over the past two years, warehouse personnel ""probably average four to six KIA a month and six to eight wounded a month,"" said Leon Sharon, the Falcon Security representative, dressed in a khaki military uniform with a ""Falcon 6"" patch identifying him as a field commander for the company.

""It's not a game,"" Sharon said. ""People get killed here trying to go home. People trying to come here get killed because they work here. People on convoy escort get killed because of the materiel that we're shipping out of here. Truck drivers get killed because they get caught up in these ambushes. And you have security personnel who end up caught up in the mix. And the work has to go on as normal.""

Attacks on Iraqi employees became so common that a trauma center was set up inside the main warehouse. Dozens of Iraqis, fearful of going home after work, live in barracks-style housing in the compound.

Sharon, 61, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is rail thin with a weathered, intelligent face shaped by chain-smoking and four decades of military work. He works out of a small office that is also his bedroom. A humidor sits on his desk. A U.S. flag covers his window. Cartons of Marlboro Reds are stacked behind him near a leather-bound copy of the Koran.

Sharon called Falcon Security a ""private military company.""

""When you have this many men, you don't manage it as you do a corporation. You manage it very much in the military style,"" he said. ""My men aren't carrying potatoes; they're carrying AK-47s. It's not pilferage we're worried about. It's people storming the walls.""

Falcon performs ""a military-like role"" in Iraq, he said, ""with one key exception: We do not, and have no desire to, conduct offensive operations.""

But even behind the blast walls, the private and public wars collide, Sharon said. Last year, insurgents attacked a passing U.S. military convoy on a highway outside the gates. Kurdish guards in one of the towers opened fire, killing two insurgents. ""The Americans were thrilled,"" he said.

""All of the work that's being conducted here in Iraq by private security companies would have to be conducted by somebody, and that somebody is U.S. military personnel,"" he said. ""If you had 500 soldiers here, that's 500 less soldiers that you have on the battlefield. And this isn't the only site. There are hundreds of sites around Iraq where you have private security. Where are you going to get this personnel?""

Sharon turns 62 in October. Asked when he planned to leave Iraq, he smiled.

""Last man here, please put the key under the door,"" he said."
141,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"The convoy was ambushed in broad daylight last Nov. 16, dozens of armed men swarming over 37 tractor-trailers stretching for more than a mile on southern Iraq's main highway. The attackers seized four Americans and an Austrian employed by Crescent Security Group, a small private security firm. Then they fled.

None of the hostages has been found, eight months after one of the largest and most brazen kidnappings of Americans since the March 2003 invasion.

Crescent is shuttered, like dozens of other companies that have come and gone in Iraq's booming market for private security services. The firm leaves behind a trail of broken lives and a record of alleged misconduct. In March, the U.S. military barred Crescent from U.S. bases after it was found with weapons prohibited for private security companies, including rocket launchers and grenades, according to documents and interviews with former Crescent employees and U.S. officials.

An investigation by The Washington Post found that Crescent violated U.S. military regulations while being paid millions of dollars to support the U.S.-led mission in Iraq. The company routinely sacrificed safety to cut costs. On the day of the kidnappings, just seven Crescent guards protected the immense convoy as it drove through southern Iraq, a force that security experts described as inadequate to fend off a major attack.

Former senior managers with Crescent denied any wrongdoing and said the guards who were seized had been well equipped and simply failed to thwart the kidnappers.

""We pretty much catered to them. We spoiled them,"" said Scott Schneider, the company's former director of security. ""You know, basically the operators screwed up,"" he added. ""I mean, you hate to speak ill of people, but the way the situation transpired, they just made mistake after mistake"" as the convoy came under attack.

Schneider oversaw Crescent's security operations for more than two years, despite having pleaded guilty, according to court records, to misdemeanor charges of breaking and entering and domestic violence in Michigan in the mid-1990s. Under U.S. law, it is a felony for domestic violence offenders to carry firearms, a prohibition that was adopted by the Defense Department for military and civilian personnel.

Crescent's managing partner, Franco Picco, said he fired Schneider, who earned $10,000 a month, after becoming aware of his criminal background shortly after the kidnappings.

Based in Kuwait City, about an hour from Iraq's southern border, Crescent was formed in 2003, part of a security industry that mushroomed overnight in Iraq in response to troop shortages and mounting insurgent attacks. By this year, the Private Security Company Association of Iraq, a trade group based in Baghdad's Green Zone, listed 177 active foreign and Iraqi security companies. The Pentagon has said that some 20,000 security contractors support the U.S.-led coalition, although some estimates are considerably higher.

The industry is largely unregulated by the U.S. and Iraqi governments, leaving companies to establish their own standards for operating on the battlefield.

This article is based on two eyewitness accounts of the ambush, company documents and interviews with former Crescent employees, including the four missing Americans. Two weeks before they were taken, the men expressed growing concern for their personal safety to a reporter traveling with them in Iraq.

""We're not the badasses we used to think we were,"" said one of them, Paul Reuben, now 40, a former Marine from Buffalo, Minn., sitting in his Kuwait City dormitory on the eve of a convoy mission. ""I realize I'm vulnerable.""

The guards have not been seen since the Jan. 3 airing of a video made by their captors. Picco said he is convinced that the men are still alive. He said he has spent more than $300,000 seeking information about their fate and blamed U.S. and British authorities for failing to follow up leads that he believes would have led to their release.

""Alive or dead, I will bring them back,"" Picco said during an interview this month in Kuwait City, where he continues to run logistics and catering businesses. ""Whether it takes me 10 years or a month. That's just the moral thing to do. . . . These guys are part of me.""

Relatives of the missing men have begun to speak out publicly, providing some details about them and the ambush in newspaper articles and on Web sites. The families have offered a $150,000 reward for information leading to release of the men.

U.S. officials in Baghdad said the investigation is still open. ""We have no information to indicate they are not alive, but we are concerned about their health and welfare,"" said U.S. Embassy spokesman Philip Reeker. ""Efforts toward their safe recovery are a high priority for the United States.""

There has been no communication from the captors, according to U.S. officials, Crescent and the families.

The attack and seizure have spotlighted Crescent's low-budget approach to private security and raised questions about whether the company was vulnerable to such an attack. Another missing guard, Jonathon Cote, now 24, a former Army paratrooper from Buffalo, N.Y., described Crescent as ""ghetto"" because of its relatively low pay, its minimal hiring standards and what he and other guards described as management's willingness to bend rules and cut corners.

""I've worked for a billion companies, and this is the worst I've ever worked for,"" said Brad Ford, a former Crescent guard who now works in Afghanistan for another security firm. ""I couldn't believe how they were getting away with all the stuff they were getting away with.""

Crescent crafted its own military identification badges to enable its employees -- including unscreened Iraqis -- to gain admittance to U.S. bases, according to several former guards, two of whom provided copies of the badges. Some guards smuggled weapons and liquor across the Iraq-Kuwait border in secret compartments they referred to as stash boxes, the former employees said. As attacks became more frequent and lethal, Crescent continued to armor its gun trucks -- black Chevrolet Avalanches with belt-fed machine guns mounted in back -- with steel plates welded inside the doors, even though some guards had requested additional protection.

The company often hired guards with little or no experience. Reuben, the company medic, was a self-described alcoholic who was not certified as an emergency medical technician and had resigned as a suburban Minneapolis police officer in 2003 after a drunk-driving violation. David Horner, 54, a truck driver from Visalia, Calif., said Crescent hired him over the Internet in 2005 and put him to work immediately, even though he had not served in the military since 1973 and had never picked up an AK-47, the automatic assault rifle used by many of the company's guards.

On Nov. 16, Crescent's trucks pushed into Iraq without any of the firm's Iraqi guards, leaving the ill-fated convoy severely undermanned. The company also had not filed paperwork with the ground-control center in Baghdad that monitors nonmilitary convoys, according to those authorities, who still do not list the Crescent hostages among their casualty figures for killed, wounded and missing because the convoy was unregistered. That oversight limited Crescent's communication with the command center responsible for coordinating the military's emergency response to attacks on civilian convoys.

Security experts described the lapses as unconscionable. ""It's insane. I don't know how you could sleep,"" said Cameron Simpson, country operations manager for ArmorGroup International, a British firm that protects one-third of all nonmilitary convoys in Iraq. ArmorGroup normally assigns 20 security contractors to protect no more than 10 tractor-trailers.

Picco said employees such as Reuben, who had previously worked for two other security companies, were presumed to have been vetted before joining Crescent. He said the company shunned fully armored trucks, not to save money but because guards preferred vehicles that allowed them to return fire and maneuver more easily. Picco's deputy, Paul Chapman, said the Italian military, which held the contract, was responsible for monitoring the convoy, even though private companies provided the trailers as well as security.

""We tried to be 110 percent legal in everything we did,"" Chapman said, adding that Crescent was licensed by the Iraqi Interior Ministry.

Picco said the team leader that day, John Young, 44, an Army veteran and carpenter from Lee's Summit, Mo., made the decision to leave a team of Iraqis behind without the company's knowledge and went into Iraq with just seven Western guards to protect the 37 trailers. ""I think complacency set in,"" Picco said. ""Why would you leave a complete team behind?""

But Andy Foord, a Crescent guard from Britain who was left bound inside a truck as the kidnappers fled, said in an interview that none of the Iraqi guards had reported for work that morning. He said Young informed Crescent's operations center in Kuwait City that the undermanned convoy intended to proceed into Iraq. ""They knew, because John called them from the Iraq border,"" Foord said.



Several former Iraqi employees of Crescent were spotted among the kidnappers, according to Foord and a written report by Jaime Salgado, another guard who was left behind and later freed. Foord said he believes the attack was set up by an Iraqi interpreter who had advance knowledge of the mission.

Crescent is ""blaming these boys, and they're not here to answer about it themselves,"" said Sharon DeBrabander, the mother of Young, the missing team leader. ""I don't think that's right. They're covering up their butts, that's what they're doing.""

'I Only Came Over Here For the Money'
""War is inevitable. You cannot cancel it. You can only postpone it to your advantage."" That message was scrawled on a dry erase board in Picco's Kuwait City office.

Picco, 38, who was born in Italy and reared in South Africa, formed Crescent in 2003, initially to protect trucks belonging to his shipping company, Mercato del Golfo.

""Everyone knew when Iraq opened up there was going to be money to be made,"" he said.

As business boomed but security deteriorated, Crescent expanded. The company gained a reputation for traveling to the riskiest destinations, often for half as much as its competitors. At its peak, it earned $600,000 to $800,000 a month providing convoy protection, according to Picco, and was profiled in a 2006 book on private security contracting, ""A Bloody Business,"" by Gerald Schumacher, a retired U.S. Special Forces colonel.

""We protect the military. Isn't that mind-boggling?"" Picco said in an interview last November. ""And I'm talking about escorting soldiers, as well. Isn't that frightening?""

Most of Crescent's employees were military and law enforcement veterans willing to accept extreme risk in exchange for fast money and adventure. Crescent handed out monthly pay in envelopes stuffed with Kuwaiti dinars. The guards took the money to currency exchange houses, which transferred the funds into their bank accounts.

""All you're thinking about is the money,"" said Chris Jackson, 28, a former Marine from Salem, N.H. ""You have $50,000 in the bank, and all you're thinking about is, 'Another month and I'll have $57,000, another month and I'll have $64,000.' "" By the end of last year, Jackson said, he had saved $55,000, even after splurging on Las Vegas vacations and a $5,000 Panerai watch.

""I hate to say it, but I am so thankful for this war,"" he said. ""I only came over here for the money, and I didn't even know I could do this job until two years ago. I didn't know it was available to me.""

Crescent's Iraqi employees were recruited by word of mouth; most lived around the southern city of Basra, a hotbed of Shiite militias, and were largely unknown to the company. Crescent used a two-tiered pay scale. Guards from the United States, Britain and other Western countries earned $7,000 a month or more. Iraqi guards earned $600 -- roughly $20 a day -- but performed the most dangerous work, including the manning of belt-fed machine guns while exposed in the back of the Avalanches.

Picco said the system was not ideal but was necessary to hold down costs. ""To put 12 white people on a team, it's not economically viable,"" he said.

Before the attack, relations between the Western and Iraqi guards had deteriorated. Foord said the Iraqis were refusing to man the machine guns. After a rash of thefts, Crescent fired a group of Iraqi guards on his recommendation, Foord said.

One month before the kidnappings, Crescent's entire stockpile of weapons -- dozens of AK-47s, PKM machine guns, grenade launchers, thousands of rounds of ammunition, body armor -- disappeared from locked shipping containers at a compound across the border in Iraq, Picco and several former employees recalled.

Picco said he sent out one of his Iraqi employees with $50,000 to buy new weapons on the black market. Some of the guns came back with serial numbers matching those on the stolen weapons.

'There Was No Place They Couldn't Go'
Last August, three months before the attack, a Crescent-led convoy was transporting trucks to an Iraqi army compound in Numaniyah, about 50 miles southeast of Baghdad. On an isolated stretch of Main Supply Route Tampa, the principal highway in southern Iraq, a bomb struck a Crescent gun truck carrying three Iraqi guards. One died within minutes. Another was pinned inside the truck, his hands severed and his femur protruding from his pants-leg.

Reuben, the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who served as the company medic, reached for his trauma kit. But Crescent had failed to provide him with tourniquets and morphine, Reuben recalled before he was seized, so he tried to stanch the bleeding with swatches of fabric he tore from his armored vest. The driver remained conscious for 45 minutes but bled to death, Reuben said. ""If they saw what I saw, they would get what we need,"" he said.

Picco said Crescent gave Reuben all the medical supplies he asked for, suggesting that any shortages stemmed from his own failure to ask.

A friendly, heavy-set man who turned 40 shortly after he was kidnapped, Reuben wore an EMT cap but said his training came mostly from first-aid courses and books. He said he now drank alcohol only occasionally. Schneider, Crescent's former director of security, said that the company was aware of Reuben's history of alcoholism but added that Reuben had been ""cleaning himself up.""

""In this job, as long as you have people willing to work for the money, you don't need a medic,"" said Cote, the missing former paratrooper. ""The military is different, because you care about your soldiers, and they're doing it for service and commitment. For us, it's like a paycheck. I still think you should have some necessities, but you don't always get those.""

For employees unable to obtain the military identification badges needed to gain access to U.S. bases, Crescent created its own Italian security cards in Kuwait City, according to former employees.

""This thing was used by the Iraqis, mainly, to get them on base and get them in the commissaries,"" said Horner, one of the guards. ""It worked sometimes -- sometimes. They could flash this Italian logistics security card, and depending on how sharp the guard was decided whether they could go in.""

Horner said the Iraqis were instructed to identify themselves as Egyptians to avoid arousing suspicion. He said the Iraqis and some Western contractors used the ID cards to gain admittance to the Green Zone in Baghdad; Camp Victory, near Baghdad International Airport; and Logistics Support Area Anaconda, the largest U.S. base in Iraq.

""There's no place they couldn't go,"" Horner said of the Iraqis. ""They could have been mapping the whole damn place, and we never would have known.""

Schneider acknowledged that Crescent made its own badges but said they were used only in Italian-run sectors. ""We made them up, but they were recognized, so I guess you could call them official,"" he said. Picco said that the Italian military had authorized Crescent to make its own badges and that he had distributed them judiciously.

The badges were not fake, he said, even though Crescent guards referred to them as fake IDs.

""That's not a fact, it's just an expression,"" Picco said.

'You Are Going to Die'
The route scheduled for Nov. 16 was regarded as safe by the Crescent guards. They made the run almost daily, part of a long-standing contract to assist the Italian military, which was withdrawing its troops and equipment from Tallil Air Base near Nasiriyah, where Picco also operated a restaurant and a pizza joint for soldiers.

The mood at the border had been tense for months. Iraqi border police had confiscated trailers from several convoys, including Crescent's. Foord, the British guard, said that the week before, he had resisted border police officers' efforts to steal a truck, sparking a confrontation in which an Iraqi officer pointed a gun at his head. The incident closed the border for six hours, Foord said.

Crescent normally traveled with at least two or three Iraqi guards in each vehicle. The Iraqis would join the convoy at Wolf's Den, a border compound named after a Crescent employee who was killed in 2004.

On the day of the kidnapping, the Crescent team crossed the border two hours early and found just one Iraqi waiting for them. He was Wissam Hisham, an interpreter nicknamed ""John Belushi"" because of his resemblance to the late actor.

The rest of the Iraqi team wasn't there. ""We tried to contact them, but we couldn't get through on the phones,"" Foord said. ""That usually means that they don't want to run that day. It wasn't the first time they hadn't shown up. The team made a decision just to roll with it and hopefully hook up with the Iraqi team later."" Foord said he believed the guards had become complacent about the run to Tallil, which Crescent had made hundreds of times without incident.

According to Picco, a team of Iraqi guards was in fact waiting. He first said the Iraqi team had 11 experienced members, then later said there were only seven.

""There was only one -- John Belushi,"" Foord said, adding that he believes the interpreter set up the ambush. ""Not 11, not seven, just Belushi.""

The trucks snaked past Safwan, an Iraqi border city, and continued north before approaching an overpass known as Bridge 3. The point vehicle, occupied by Cote and Joshua Munns, a 24-year-old former Marine from Redding, Calif., sent word over the radio that a police checkpoint was blocking the road.

Foord stopped his Avalanche in the middle of the highway at the rear of the halted convoy. An unmarked truck suddenly roared up beside him carrying 10 armed men. One stuck an AK-47 inside the passenger door and fired, narrowly missing him as he threw his head back, according to an 11-page account he gave military investigators after the kidnapping.

Foord said he accelerated and raced to the front of the convoy in the southbound lane while the gunmen pumped rounds into his truck with their automatic weapons.

When he reached the front of the convoy, the rest of the Crescent guards were lined up on their knees by the side of the road, Foord said. But Hisham, the interpreter, appeared to be participating in the kidnapping, according to Foord's account. Foord said Hisham accused him of shooting one of the Iraqi gunmen and screamed: ""You are going to die . . . now you are going to die.""

A man in civilian clothing intervened and forced Foord to his knees near the other Crescent guards -- Cote, Munns, Young, Reuben and Bert Nussbaumer, 25, an Austrian. Foord said he spotted ""30-40"" armed men, including at least four wearing suits who appeared to be in charge. The gunmen bound the guards with handcuffs, cloth tape and a power cord and began to load them into vehicles.

Crescent guard Salgado, a Chilean who later gave a one-page statement in fractured English, said he recognized ""4 of the guys"" participating in the attack as former Crescent employees.

Foord and Salgado were placed together in Salgado's GMC Yukon. Salgado said the attackers were unable to locate the keys to his truck.

""Suddenly they get a telephone call and start to move fast,"" Salgado's account said. As the attackers began to flee, a white pickup packed with gunmen roared up beside the two men, according to Foord's report. But it had no room for them.

""Jaime and myself appeared to have been left behind because they had lost the keys to his Yukon and had no space in any of the other vehicles,"" Foord said. The abductors roared off.

Several minutes later, two American Humvees approached from the south.

""I was still waiting for the bullet in the back of the head,"" Foord said.

The Americans cut loose Foord and Salgado and escorted the tractor-trailers back to the border. Most of the drivers that day were Pakistani. Nine drivers were seized and almost immediately released. Nineteen trailers were taken; some were recovered. Crescent sent out a team to retrieve the company's vehicles.

There has been no word about the hostages since the Jan. 3 video showing the five Crescent guards. The video opened with an image of the Koran and a map of Iraq, then the words, ""The National Islamic Resistance in Iraq: The Farqan (Quran) Brigades takes responsibility for the kidnapping in Safwan, Basra.""

In January, Crescent made a lump-sum payment of $3,500 -- half a month's pay -- to each of the missing men's families. The company said it has set aside three months' salary for each guard, to be paid on their release.

'This Will Never Happen Again'
After the kidnappings, Picco moved Crescent to Tallil Air Base. The company cut its staff and ran occasional security missions while waiting for news about the hostages.



On Feb. 1, U.S. military police entered Crescent's living quarters and found 143 cans of beer, illegal steroids and an assortment of weapons that private security companies are prohibited from possessing under U.S. military regulations, including seven fragmentation grenades, a Bushmaster rifle with its serial number removed and four antitank weapons known as LAW rockets, according to a memorandum the military later sent to Crescent.

A month later, the military opened shipping containers belonging to Crescent and found more banned weapons, including four .50-caliber machine guns, 2,200 rounds of .50-caliber ammunition and nine more LAWs.

The Army informed Picco and Crescent Security that the company had been banned from U.S. bases ""due to blatant disregard"" of the arming guidelines for U.S. and Iraqi private security companies, according to the memorandum.

Picco protested that the weapons were legal and that Crescent was being targeted for unknown reasons, possibly related to the November ambush and seizure. But on March 6, before closing Crescent down, he signed a brief statement.

""I accept full responsibility for my company's non-compliance with established guidance and understand that any future infractions will result in additional barment from this installation,"" the statement said. ""I assure you this will never happen again.""

Crescent's vehicles, including Andy Foord's bullet-pocked Avalanche, sit idle in a dirt parking lot outside Kuwait City. The company continues to maintain a Web site, still featuring its motto: ""Integrity-Commitment-Success.""

Tomorrow: Why they came to Iraq."
142,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"Surrounded by darkness, an AK-47 at his side, Jonathon Cote considered his future from the driver's seat of a black Chevy Avalanche hurtling through southern Iraq early last November.

Months earlier, Cote had been a reluctant accounting major at the University of Florida, a popular 23-year-old freshman who'd enrolled after four years in the Army. Cote pledged Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and collected $5 covers at a bar called the Whiskey Room. He drove a red Yamaha R1 motorcycle around campus until one evening he did a wheelie and was arrested for drunk driving.

Broke and despondent, Cote spoke to an Army buddy, who told him he could make $7,000 a month protecting supply convoys in Iraq. On his days off, his friend told him, he'd get to go jet-skiing on the Persian Gulf. Cote was concerned that he might lose his Florida driver's license, but in Iraq he would pilot a company ""gun truck"" with a belt-fed machine gun mounted in back.

""Basically I was looking for a feeling that I didn't have, and this job provided that,"" Cote said, his iPod set to shuffle as he steered his truck through the soft Iraqi night. ""It's a distraction from the DUI, how I couldn't find a degree that I liked in college. And then there's the money. I have $30,000, and I'm going back to school with a plan.""

""Life-threatening situations straighten you up fast,"" he said.

He had already announced his intention to return home on his U.S. voice mail and had picked a new major, exercise physiology.

On Nov. 16, Cote's plan was undone by the realities of Iraq. Driving their gun trucks along the same stretch of highway where he had sketched his future, he and four colleagues from Crescent Security Group, a small private firm, were ambushed and taken hostage. The status of the four Americans and one Austrian, 25-year-old Bert Nussbaumer of Vienna, is unknown. Cote's 24th birthday passed Feb. 11. His drunk-driving case was dismissed after the seizure.

Two weeks before the attack, the four Americans spoke at length to a Washington Post reporter traveling with them in Iraq. Together, their stories describe the diverse motivations of the private security guards whose numbers have proliferated since the start of the war, with tens of thousands of armed civilians taking on some of the most dangerous tasks.

All four missing Americans are military veterans; two -- Cote and Joshua Munns, a 24-year-old former Marine from Redding, Calif. -- did combat tours in Iraq. Their comments reveal men acutely aware of their vulnerability, yet driven by life choices that transcend mercenary stereotypes. To a man, they said they had come to Iraq for fast money. But they were also lured by the camaraderie they had known in the military, the continuous rush of adrenaline, the opportunity to see history unfold and the chance to escape mundane lives back home.

""This is me, okay? This is me,"" said John Young, who led the Crescent team that was ambushed and is among the missing. Young, 44, of Lee's Summit, Mo., is 5-foot-8 and thin, with a shaved head, blond mustache and piercing blue eyes. After leaving the Army in 1991, he worked as a carpenter in a family business before joining Crescent in 2005. He has a 15-year-old daughter, Jasmyn, and a 19-year-old son, John Robert.

Young had decided to keep returning to Iraq, even after a bullet took a chunk out of the collar of his armored vest and threw him into the steering wheel as he escorted a convoy through Baghdad one afternoon.

The tattered vest that saved him was displayed on a wooden table in a conference room at Crescent's Kuwait City offices.

""I want to have a normal life -- I always have -- but I've always known that I'm not that kind of person,"" Young said.

""I've spent an entire lifetime trying to explain it to myself. I mean, my children are a big thing to me. I'm not saying I'm the best dad in the world, but I love my children. I want to see my daughter get married. I want to see my son graduate. I want normal things in life. But I'm not normal.""

The conversations took place in the cabs of the Crescent gun trucks as the guards drove through the Iraqi desert; during long waits before they crossed the sand-choked Kuwait-Iraq border; at Popeyes, T.G.I. Friday's and other Kuwait City restaurants that reminded them of home; and in their spare, dormitory-style rooms, filled with video game players and televisions and family pictures, where they passed time between missions.

At the time of the kidnapping, Crescent had 17 Western employees, from the United States, Britain, Chile, Austria and New Zealand, according to Franco Picco, the company's managing partner. Paul Chapman, Picco's deputy, said Crescent received roughly 600 job applications from abroad each month.

The company closed down within months of the attack.

""To me, this is a prestigious job,"" Cote said before the ambush and seizure.

""There's only a certain percentage of people who are doing this. It's like a hidden, secret part of the war, and if I could be part of that hidden, secret thing, it would be cool, you know? It's kind of like being part of history. People are gonna be like, 'Oh, man, remember the war? Where were you?' I was here. I was here.""

'It's Not the Getting Hit Part That Bothers Me' 

Crescent operated out of a quiet sandstone villa in Kuwait City, across the street from a mosque. The guards lived in rooms with wireless Internet, twin beds, wooden desks and concrete floors. Before dawn, as the Muslim call to prayer echoed through the courtyard, the men, clad in khakis and black shirts with a white Crescent logo, climbed into their trucks to make the one-hour drive to Iraq.

After reaching Camp Navistar, a border staging base, the men fueled their vehicles, then waited in a dirt lot in the heat for clearance to cross into Iraq. The constant rumble of Humvees, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and tractor-trailers filled the air with dust and the stench of diesel fumes. The wait could last for hours.

""I haven't been home in four months,"" said Paul Reuben, a former Marine, as he waited at the border one morning.

Reuben turned 40 eight days after he was seized. He stands 6-foot-4, weighs 260 pounds and smiles almost continuously, his beard and gentle manner giving him the look of an overstuffed teddy bear. Reuben has a twin brother, Patrick, a Minneapolis police officer, twin 16-old-daughters, Bree Anne and Casey Nicole, and a 16-year-old stepson, Terrell. He resigned from the St. Louis Park, Minn., police department in 2003 after a drunk-driving arrest. Reuben said he applied online for private security jobs and was hired immediately.

Waiting at the staging base, Reuben said he was exhausted from having worked ""72 or 73 days straight"" and jittery from fending off constant attacks. Two weeks earlier, he'd thought he heard fireworks while driving through Basra, a city racked by militia-fueled violence, but quickly realized the explosions were a volley of rocket-propelled grenades aimed at his convoy.

""The RPG attacks were the scariest thing I've ever seen,"" he said.

Reuben went back and forth about whether to stay on. He weighed the risk and time away from his family against the cash, which never seemed to be enough, and the appeal of the warrior lifestyle.

""I kind of like doing it. I enjoy it,"" he said, smiling. ""I'm getting caught up on some bills and stuff like that. And I heard they're coming out with that new Dodge Challenger in 2008. I want that.""

""I can't handle monotony,"" said Munns, the young former Marine who is also missing. ""I gotta have something that shocks my system so I know I'm still alive.""

Munns is tall and lanky, with an air of military discipline and close-cropped brown hair that fluffs into an Afro when he doesn't cut it. A meticulously scripted tattoo encircles his left forearm: ""The unwanted, doing the unforgivable, for the ungrateful."" The tattoo was the motto of his Marine sniper platoon, which fought in the 2004 assault on Fallujah.

""It's us doing the dirty work for the rest of our society who don't really care about us,"" he said.

Munns left the Marines in 2005 and said he immediately regretted his decision. He spent a year installing swimming pools for Viking Pools of Redding but still worked half as hard as he did in the military. He had applied to reenlist in the Marines when the Crescent job came along.

The job fulfilled Munns's need for excitement, he said. It also helped him and his fiancee, Jackie Shaw, buy a three-level fixer-upper in Redding that he dreamed of renovating himself. At the time of the attack, the house purchase was in progress.

The culture of private security was different from the brotherhood Munns had known in the Marines. He said he reserved his loyalty for his two closest friends, Cote and Mike Skora, an Army veteran from Chicago. The three guards had made a pact, half in jest: They would take their own lives or shoot each other to avoid being captured.

""I'd take a bullet for them,"" Munns said of Cote and Skora. ""The rest of these people, I probably wouldn't.""

Munns turned to Cote one morning as they prepared to cross the border. ""It's not the getting hit part that bothers me,"" he said. ""It's the getting lost and getting hung from a bridge part.""

Cote chuckled.

'I'd Go Home and I'd Feel Empty'
Jonathon Cote has a boy's face and cornerback's build, the result of weightlifting and a joyless diet of salads without dressing and canned peaches that he kept stacked in his closet. He wore T-shirts and extravagantly torn jeans as he strolled through Kuwait City's malls, drawing glances amid men in starched white robes and women in black abayas.

His older brother Christopher called Jonathon an ""extrovert in the extreme,"" a sensitive thrill-seeker who craves speed and adventure. The son of a Marine, Jon Cote was born in Long Beach, Calif., and went to high school in suburban Buffalo, N.Y.; for kicks, he and his brother would tether a snowboard to a car and ride it through a foot of snow.

In Kuwait City, Cote exercised at a local gym, then spent hours in a backroom shop watching a jeweler painstakingly craft a ring for his mother's birthday. Driving through Baghdad, he'd roll down the windows and turn up the music on his stereo, rocking in his seat with some of Crescent's Iraqi guards. ""You don't have to worry about much if you're having a good time,"" he said.

Cote's friends and family laughed when they heard he was majoring in accounting at Florida. ""It was like an oxymoron: Jon the accountant,"" Chris said.

Cote said he hated most of his four years in the Army. He disdained authority. College life suited him better, at least at first. People were drawn to the freshman with combat experience; even the seniors looked up to him.

But Cote said he felt disoriented, caught between the disciplined world he had left behind in the military and a new one that seemed shallow in comparison. Cote had also done a tour in Afghanistan. He once remarked to Chris that it seemed as if he had lived two lifetimes compared with the students around him. ""I was like this fun, energetic kid who made everybody laugh and made everybody have a good time,"" he said. ""But on the inside I was torn apart. I didn't know how to deal with it. So I'd go out to a party and have an awesome time, and then I'd go home and I'd feel empty. And I'd be like, 'Why do I feel this way? What . . . is wrong with me?' ""

The drunk-driving arrest was merely the last straw, Cote said. ""I was ashamed of what I did. And I couldn't pay for school, I couldn't pay for my apartment. I didn't want to deal with not being able to drive. I had to get a job, and the job I was going to get was probably going to be working in a bar and dealing with all these college people and their bull.""

Cote had kept in touch with Skora, his old squad leader in the 82nd Airborne. After leaving the military, Skora, 35, had applied online for private security jobs. Within a month, he was in Iraq with another now-defunct security firm. He later moved to Crescent.

Cote was reluctant to leave school, but he looked at the security job as a chance to straighten out his life.

""It basically gave me an opportunity to run away from my problems,"" he said. ""So I just left."" 

'And the Screams. . . . It Rips Your Heart Out' 

Cote soon discovered there was no time for jet-skiing.
The work was constant, and he developed a love-hate relationship with his job. For the first time since entering college, he believed he was involved in something meaningful.

""Without us, who knows what would happen to the drivers and the cargo?"" he said. He felt no guilt about the money. ""The war is here. I didn't start it. If I could do it for my country, why couldn't I come over here and make a little money?""

But the work was relentless, and more dangerous than he'd imagined. ""That's the worst part about this job: There's no time to think about yourself. Sometimes you should take a step back and take it all in and be like, 'What am I really here for? Why am I really doing this? Is it really worth it?' You go out, you get hit and come back, you go out and get hit and come back. You just become numb, and you just do it.""

Cote said he was increasingly repulsed by what he saw on Iraq's dangerous roads. Last August, he was sent out with a Crescent team to pick up the remains of an Iraqi guard who had been killed in a bombing. The body had been taken to Tallil Air Base, about three hours north of the border. The temperature in southern Iraq that day was close to 120 degrees.

The military handed over the body in a metal coffin filled with ice. ""They were really apologetic because they didn't know which end was up or the bottom or whatever,"" Cote said.

Crescent guards met the man's family beneath an overpass outside Basra; it was too dangerous for them to enter the city. As Cote helped strap the coffin to the roof of an orange-and-white sedan, the man's brother screamed the dead guard's name, Basheer, over and over, the name echoing beneath the overpass as he beat his fists against his chest.

Cote was suddenly stricken: The coffin had a drip valve that was positioned directly over the windshield. Water and blood trickled over the glass. ""Just that kind of mental picture, it's not something you want to have in your head,"" he said.

""And the screams from his family. It rips your heart out.""

Cote recalled looking at Skora when he got back to Kuwait.

""I don't know, man,"" he said, shaking his head. ""I don't know about this.""

But he decided to stay.

'I Still Feel Bad. I Wasn't There for Him.'
On the eve of the kidnapping, Cote stayed up all night with Skora at the Crescent villa, talking excitedly about his plans to return home. He had set a date, Dec. 7, just three weeks away. He planned to return to school in the spring.

The next day, Skora wasn't on the convoy. ""I still feel bad,"" he said recently in Baghdad. ""I wasn't there for him.""

Crescent teams had made the run nearly every day for months without incident. On Nov. 16, the guards planned to lead a convoy of 37 tractor-trailers up Main Supply Route Tampa to Tallil Air Base, then return to Kuwait.

Cote shared the point vehicle with Munns. They were the first to encounter the fake checkpoint where the ambush occurred. Dozens of masked men, some in Iraqi police uniforms, had set up a roadblock. They forced the guards from their vehicles at gunpoint.

In his eyewitness account, Andy Foord, a British guard who was left behind, described Cote as initially confused, believing that the attackers ""were the police and they were just checking our weapons serial numbers, weapons permits and licenses.""

Cote wasn't seen again until Dec. 26, when the captors released a time-stamped video that had been shot approximately two weeks after the ambush. The footage opened with an image of the Koran and a map of Iraq, then this message: ""The National Islamic Resistance in Iraq: The Farqan (Quran) Brigades takes responsibility for the kidnapping in Safwan, Basra.""

The Crescent hostages sat cross-legged on the floor. Cote had the only visible injuries: His nose was swollen, and red blotches could be seen on his face.

""My name is Jonathon Cote,"" he said, calmly. He wore a short-sleeved white T-shirt, gray pants and socks. ""I am 23, from Gainesville, Florida. I work for a private security company. I am asking the American people to put pressure on the government to leave Iraq to help me and my friends to get out of here.""



The four other hostages identified themselves and made similar statements. Reuben wore a tracksuit with orange shoulder stripes. ""I'm 39 years old, or 40; I'm not quite sure of today's date,"" he said. ""I'm from Buffalo, Minnesota. I'm married. I have twin daughters -- they're 16 -- and I have a stepson that's 16.""

A second video, time-stamped Dec. 21 and Dec. 22, was released Jan. 3. The hostages again called for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq.

Since then, prayer vigils have been held in Kansas City, Minneapolis, Gainesville and Clarence, N.Y., outside Buffalo.

In Gainesville, Sigma Phi Epsilon placed a 20-foot yellow ribbon on the front of its house.

In Redding, Calif., Josh Munns's new home deal fell through.

There has been no communication from the captors."
143,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"Blackwater USA, the private security company involved in a Baghdad shootout last weekend, operated under State Department authority that exempted the company from U.S. military regulations governing other security firms, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials and industry representatives.

In recent months, the State Department's oversight of Blackwater became a central issue as Iraqi authorities repeatedly clashed with the company over its aggressive street tactics. Many U.S. and Iraqi officials and industry representatives said they came to see Blackwater as untouchable, protected by State Department officials who defended the company at every turn. Blackwater employees protect the U.S. ambassador and other diplomats in Iraq.

Blackwater ""has a client who will support them no matter what they do,"" said H.C. Lawrence Smith, deputy director of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq, an advocacy organization in Baghdad that is funded by security firms, including Blackwater.

The State Department allowed Blackwater's heavily armed teams to operate without an Interior Ministry license, even after the requirement became standard language in Defense Department security contracts. The company was not subject to the military's restrictions on the use of offensive weapons, its procedures for reporting shooting incidents or a central tracking system that allows commanders to monitor the movements of security companies on the battlefield.

""The Iraqis despised them, because they were untouchable,"" said Matthew Degn, who recently returned from Baghdad after serving as senior American adviser to the Interior Ministry. ""They were above the law."" Degn said Blackwater's armed Little Bird helicopters often buzzed the Interior Ministry's roof, ""almost like they were saying, 'Look, we can fly anywhere we want.'""

A Blackwater spokeswoman referred questions about how the company is regulated to the State Department.

Richard J. Griffin, assistant secretary for diplomatic security, said in a statement that State Department security contractors are routinely briefed on rules for the use of force. When a shooting incident occurs, he said, it is reviewed by the U.S. Embassy's Regional Security Office. ""Anyone who fails to live up to our standards will be removed from the contract,"" Griffin said.

On Wednesday, the State Department announced that it will form a joint commission with the Iraqi government to examine issues related to private security.

In Baghdad, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki promised that Blackwater guards would be held accountable for what he called ""a big crime"" in the weekend violence. Iraqi officials have threatened to expel Blackwater from Iraq over the incident, in which at least nine Iraqis were killed.

""We will not allow Iraqis to be killed in cold blood,"" Maliki said. ""There is a sense of tension and anger among all Iraqis, including the government, over this crime.""

The confrontation between the Iraqi government and Blackwater, based in Moyock, N.C., has illuminated the uneven and largely dysfunctional regulatory system intended to govern tens of thousands of hired guns operating in Iraq.

A one-paragraph subsection to a 2004 edict issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the now-defunct U.S. occupation government, granted contractors immunity from the Iraqi legal process. This edict is still in effect. Congress has moved to establish guidelines for prosecuting contractors under U.S. law or the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but the issue remains unresolved.

""It's a lot of people with guns who are under no real law, and that's very troublesome,"" said Sen. James Webb (D-Va.), who has advocated greater oversight of private security companies. ""Ninety-five percent of the people who are doing this are honest, ethical and moral, but the fringe that isn't, it's very difficult to see the legal construct that will hold them accountable.""

Interior Ministry officials have said they had received information on six previous cases in which Blackwater guards allegedly opened fire on civilians, more than any other company.

Blackwater's conduct at times inflamed tensions inside the Interior Ministry, Degn said. On May 24, Degn was evacuated from the building after an armed standoff between Interior Ministry commandos and Blackwater guards, who had shot and killed an Iraqi driver outside the gates. U.S. and Iraqi officials feared the incident might lead to retaliatory attacks against Americans.

""They are part of the reason for all the hatred that is directed at Americans, because people don't know them as Blackwater, they know them only as Americans,"" said an Interior Ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety. The official, interviewed before Sunday's incident, said, ""They are planting hatred, because of these irresponsible acts.""

Problems of Accountability
The use of private security skyrocketed in Iraq after the March 2003 invasion because of troop shortages and growing violence. U.S. authorities have no idea how many hired guns operate in the country; estimates range from 20,000 to 50,000 or higher.

To a large degree, the companies regulate themselves. Lawrence T. Peter, director of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq, which represents at least 50 security companies, also serves as a $40-per-hour consultant on security issues to the Pentagon's Defense Reconstruction Support Office, which issues contracts.

Peter, during an interview in Baghdad, said that while serving as an adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority he wrote the initial drafts of Memorandum 17, dated June 26, 2004, which established operating guidelines for security companies and remains ""the extant law for private security contractors in Iraq.""

The rules on use of force are introduced in capital letters with the statement: ""NOTHING IN THESE RULES LIMITS YOUR INHERENT RIGHT TO TAKE ACTION NECESSARY TO DEFEND YOURSELF.""

A separate document, CPA Order 17, dated June 27, 2004, granted the private security companies immunity from Iraqi law.

The CPA administrator, L. Paul Bremer, left Iraq the next day after transferring authority to an interim Iraqi government.

Vetting of security companies in Iraq remains so lax that another organization, the International Contractors Association, has offered to help companies discern experienced guards from those who lack qualifications. ""If people won't regulate us, we will regulate ourselves, and we will do so professionally,"" said Jaco S. Botes, a South African contractor who heads the association.

""If the industry goes unchecked, it will implode -- that's just the logical way of things to happen,"" he said. ""It's like a landslide. It will grow and grow until everybody is just fed up.""

Over the past year, the military has issued a series of ""fragos,"" or fragmentary orders, designed to impose greater accountability on security contractors operating under Defense Department contracts. Blackwater was not covered because it reported to the State Department.

The new rules included procedures for the registration of weapons and streamlined the reporting of shooting incidents. The U.S. military's director of security for the Green Zone, where approximately three dozen private security firms are based, has conducted sweeps that netted hundreds of unauthorized weapons.

The military also required companies to obtain operating licenses through the Interior Ministry to operate legally in Iraq. The licenses added another layer of accountability: Licensed companies were given colorful numbered decals to attach to the sides of their armored vehicles, clearly identifying them as belonging to a security firm.

The licensing process has been fraught with problems. Companies have complained about corruption and delays and said they feared handing over sensitive personnel and weapons data to an Iraqi ministry infiltrated by sectarian militias.

But the U.S. military and many registered companies argued that it was the only way to legitimize the industry. ""We try to comply with all rules and decrees they produce,"" said Sam Jamison, the convoy manager for ArmorGroup International, a British security firm that protects nearly one-third of all nonmilitary convoys in Iraq. ""If you come to someone else's country, and you don't abide by their laws and regulations, it's just the height of arrogance. We may not always like it but we will comply with it. We can't ask the Iraqi people to respect the rule of law if we don't do it ourselves.""

None of the new orders applied to Blackwater, which has received $678 million in State Department contracts since 2003 and operates under the department's authority.

""I'm not gonna go chasing after non-DoD organizations, going, 'Uh, you didn't submit an incident report for this,' "" said Maj. Kent Lightner of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who monitors shooting incidents involving private security contractors under Defense Department contracts.

Peter, of the private security firms' advocacy group, said the rules that govern companies often depend on who issued their contract. ""There's a different regulatory environment depending on who you work for,"" he explained.

'Heavy-Handed' Tactics
On March 31, 2004, four Blackwater employees were ambushed while escorting kitchen equipment through Fallujah. A mob shot and burned them, then hung two corpses from a bridge over the Euphrates River. To date, at least 25 Blackwater employees have been killed in Iraq.

The Fallujah attack, a turning point in the war, also led to fundamental changes in the private security industry. The military, which had been unaware that Blackwater was operating in Fallujah, created the Reconstruction Operations Center to track thousands of armed civilians on the battlefield.

Military and private security officials described the operations center as a success, with one omission: Blackwater, which played a role in its creation, does not participate.

Blackwater is not required to report its movements to the military. ""There is no oversight or coordination of Blackwater by the U.S. military,"" said Jack Holly, a retired Marine colonel who oversees several private security firms as director of logistics for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Blackwater has said that it uses its own internal tracking system that is visible to both the military and the State Department.

Holly said Blackwater angers the Iraqis: ""Their aggressive attitude is not what you would say is trying to mitigate disagreements between two societies."" Earlier this year, he said, Iraqi employees on the national rail system were so intimidated that they refused to meet State Department officials escorted by Blackwater guards.

Holly said the State Department was partly to blame for what he described as Blackwater's ""heavy-handed, almost arrogant"" tactics. ""It's obviously condoned by State and it's what State expects, because they have contract oversight and if they didn't like it they would change it,"" he said.

State Department officials said Blackwater is overseen by the agency's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. After several interview requests earlier this year on how the agency regulates Blackwater and other private security contractors, a spokesman e-mailed responses to written questions.

""State Department personnel, including contracting officers, routinely meet with private security contractors both on the ground in Iraq and in Washington D.C., and coordinate with other U.S. federal agencies and the Iraqi government with regard to compliance issues,"" the department said.

After the incident this May 24, in which Blackwater guards shot and killed an Iraqi driver outside the Interior Ministry, the Blackwater team was surrounded by Interior Ministry commandos with AK-47 assault rifles. The Blackwater guards refused to provide their names or details of the incident. A U.S. military convoy happened on the scene and an officer tried to mediate.

Eventually, a State Department official arrived, according to a security company representative familiar with the incident. The Blackwater team was allowed to return to the Green Zone.

Later, both Blackwater and the State Department initially denied that the shooting occurred. The company and agency officials then confirmed that the incident had taken place but defended the guards, saying they had followed the rules on the use of force.

The State Department said it planned a thorough investigation. Four months later, no results have been announced.

Protection 'at All Costs'
""Blackwater has no respect for the Iraqi people,"" the Interior Ministry official said. ""They consider Iraqis like animals, although actually I think they may have more respect for animals. We have seen what they do in the streets. When they're not shooting, they're throwing water bottles at people and calling them names. If you are terrifying a child or an elderly woman, or you are killing an innocent civilian who is riding in his car, isn't that terrorism?""

Ann Exline Starr, a former Coalition Provisional Authority adviser, said she traveled in Iraq first with a military escort, then with guards from Blackwater and another State Department-contracted security firm, DynCorp International, as security in Iraq deteriorated. The shift was startling, she said. The soldiers drank tea and played cards with the Iraqis. The security contractors, on the other hand, moved more aggressively, their only focus protecting Exline Starr.

""What they told me was, 'Our mission is to protect the principal at all costs. If that means pissing off the Iraqis, too bad,' "" she recalled.

Exline Starr said that most of the guards were highly professional but that their mission was different and appeared to be contrary to the U.S. government's overall goal of winning over Iraqis. She said she approached senior managers for Blackwater and DynCorp ""to express my concern over the importance of maintaining relationships that have been nurtured for over six months."" The companies took a more low-profile approach after the discussions, she said.

Chester Schultz, a former Blackwater guard from Fenton, Mich., said the company's goals differ from those of the military and the State Department.

""Unfortunately, the rules and regulations are way different than they're applied, and people are not held accountable, for the most part,"" he said. ""I'm not saying it's a bunch of cowboys, but it's a different job. We're not paid to go out and find and eliminate the insurgents. Our job is to keep people alive and safe, and do what we need to do.""

Degn said he believed that the Iraqi government was trying to hold up Blackwater as ""a symbol."" If the government can bring the company to heel, he said, all the other private security companies will have to follow.

""It's a symbol of the rift that still exists between both governments,"" he said. ""The Iraqis are trying to establish their own authority. And if they do this, they can show the world that Blackwater is not untouchable. And that the U.S. is not the ultimate authority in their country."""
144,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"Most of the more than 100 private security companies in Iraq open fire far more frequently than has been publicly acknowledged and rarely report such incidents to U.S. or Iraqi authorities, according to U.S. officials and current and former private security company employees.

Violence caused by private security guards in Iraq has come under scrutiny since a Sept. 16 shooting in Baghdad involving employees of Blackwater USA. The company's chairman, Erik Prince, told a congressional committee Tuesday that Blackwater guards opened fire on 195 occasions during more than 16,000 missions in Iraq since 2005.

However, two former Blackwater security guards said they believed employees fired more often than the company has disclosed. One, a former Blackwater guard who spent nearly three years in Iraq, said his 20-man team averaged ""four or five"" shootings a week, or several times the rate of 1.4 incidents a week reported by the company. The underreporting of shooting incidents was routine in Iraq, according to this former guard.

""The thing is, even the good companies, how many bad incidents occurred where guys involved didn't say anything, because they didn't want to be questioned, or have any downtime today to have to go over what happened yesterday?"" he said. ""I'm sure there were some companies that just didn't report anything.""

The former Blackwater guards and other private security workers spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns they would be unable to obtain future employment in the security industry. In addition, Blackwater employees reportedly sign an agreement pledging not to divulge confidential information; violations can result in a $250,000 fine imposed by the company.

Tens of thousands of private security guards operate in Iraq under a multitude of contracts, each with its own regulations. Defense and State Department contracts require security companies to report all weapons discharges, but few comply fully, according to U.S. officials and security company employees. Two company officials familiar with the system estimated that as few as 15 percent of all shooting incidents are reported, although both cautioned that it was impossible to know exactly how many incidents go unreported.

Out of nearly 30 security companies under Defense Department authority, only ""a handful"" have reported weapons discharges, said Maj. Kent Lightner of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who monitors shooting incidents involving security companies under military contracts. Lightner said the lack of reporting undermines statistics the military compiles on shooting incidents. Through May, the military had reported 207 such incidents over the previous 12 months.

""In my civilian life, if I were doing a process analysis on this thing, I would say, 'You know what, these numbers are suspect in terms of which companies are having the most incidents and what type of incidents they are,' "" Lightner said during a recent interview in Baghdad.

Col. Timothy Clapp, who preceded Lightner as director of the Reconstruction Operations Center, which tracks the movements of private security firms under Defense Department contracts, said reported incidents were usually limited to a few companies, including two British firms, Aegis Defence Services and ArmorGroup International.

Clapp said military officials became temporarily concerned last year that Aegis, which protects Corps of Engineers officials on reconstruction projects, was ""out of control"" because the company reported so many incidents. But Clapp said the numbers were skewed because Aegis conducts many more missions than other companies and because other companies rarely or never report shooting incidents.

""In their contracts, it says they are supposed to report, but whether they do or not is up to them,"" he said.

Lightner said responsibility for investigating shooting incidents involving companies under Defense Department contracts falls first to the company itself, then to the contracting officer.

U.S. officials and security company representatives said they were especially concerned about firms that operate beyond the radar of U.S. and Iraqi authorities. David Horner, who worked for Crescent Security Group, a company based in Kuwait City, said that after being attacked with a roadside bomb in a town north of Baghdad, Crescent employees fired their automatic weapons preemptively whenever they passed through the town.

""I know that I personally never saw anyone shoot at us, but we blazed through that town all the time,"" said Horner, 55, a truck driver from Visalia, Calif. ""Personally I did not take aim at one person. But I don't know what everybody else did. We'd come back at the end of the day, and a lot of times we were out of ammo.""

Horner said he did not believe any of the incidents were reported to the military. He said he quit after one of Crescent's Iraqi employees fired a belt-fed PK machine gun from the bed of Horner's truck and hit what appeared to be two members of the Iraqi National Guard.

""I was like, 'Oh man, we shot some of our own guys,' "" Horner said. He said he consulted with the Crescent team leader as the two Iraqis writhed in pain, one shot in the legs, the other with ""a bullet or two in his shoulder."" Soldiers from a nearby Iraqi army checkpoint were approaching to investigate.

""Let's get the [expletive] out of here,"" Horner quoted the team leader as saying before the Crescent team drove off.

""That was my last mission,"" Horner said. ""I wasn't over there to wreck somebody's life. There was too much cowboying going on. I really didn't know if we had made things worse over there. More than likely we did; that was my feeling.""

Crescent officials have denied any wrongdoing to the military after the company was forced to suspend operations in Iraq this year because of weapons violations.

Private security guards said the question of whether to shoot often depends on split-second decisions that can mean life or death not only for them but also for those around them. Most incidents, they said, occur when a vehicle comes close to a security convoy, forcing guards to determine whether the vehicle represents a potential car bomb or merely an erratic driver.

In the Sept. 16 incident, Iraqi witnesses have said Blackwater guards fired on a white sedan carrying a doctor and her adult son after the car failed to slow down as it approached a traffic circle. In May, a Blackwater team shot and killed a civilian driver outside the Interior Ministry; the guards told investigators that the car had driven too close to their convoy and appeared to represent a threat.

CPA Memorandum 17, signed in June 2004 by L. Paul Bremer, the departing chief of the Coalition Provisional Authority that ran the occupation, describes the ""binding Rules for the Use of Force that must be adhered to by all PSC [private security companies], their officers and employees."" The memo prescribes a series of graduated steps, including verbal warnings, physical restraint and displaying weapons. In recent years, security guards have resorted to firing pen flares, throwing water bottles, using air horns and sirens, and displaying signs warning drivers to maintain a safe distance.

In practice, the rules of force often vary from company to company and even team to team, said current and former guards. One former Blackwater guard said the rules of force for Blackwater employees on State Department contracts -- including those involved in the Sept. 16 incident -- differed from those for Blackwater guards on non-State contracts.

State Department contracts advise employees to fire ""aimed shots,"" as outlined in CPA Memorandum 17, according to the former employee. Those shots were often designed to disable the oncoming vehicle. But the rules, which were crafted to minimize civilian casualties, also preclude firing warning shots into the air or into the ground, tactics that also might alert a driver who had strayed too close.

""From the State Department perspective, they're looking at it as a liability thing: What happens to that round when it goes downrange,"" said one of the former Blackwater security guards. ""I was like: 'Look, give them a chance. Not every Iraqi in a car that's near you is a bad guy.' The guy whose car you shoot up today is also the guy who could be planting an IED [improvised explosive device] tomorrow. And the only reason he changed sides now is the car that took him 10 years of life savings to buy, now you've destroyed it.""

Of the 195 incidents cited by Prince and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 162 resulted in property damage, according to a memo released Monday by the committee.

Procedures for reporting shooting incidents also often varied, according to current and former guards. ""It's almost like a case of cover your ass,"" the former Blackwater guard said. ""It's like, 'These guys did this, they filled out this report, we have documentation on it, and unless anybody else says anything, it's in this file here.' ""

Lightner, the Army major who monitors shooting incidents, said he thought the number of reported incidents was in some ways insignificant. ""Other than entertainment value, I don't see why I need to be all that worried about the number of incidents, as long as they were legitimate,"" he said. ""If they were incidents of wrongdoing, then that's a different story.""

Lightner said he usually accepted the company's version of events. ""If they're reporting firing a weapon, and there's no wrongdoing, and they operated according to the law, then God bless 'em, drive on,"" he said. ""If Aegis sends me a report and says, 'Bad guys shot at us, we shot back and dropped two of them,' I'm not going to investigate. I'm not going to worry about it, unless somebody comes back and says, 'Yeah, they dropped two children, or they dropped a woman.' """
145,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"Last Feb. 7, a sniper employed by Blackwater USA, the private security company, opened fire from the roof of the Iraqi Justice Ministry. The bullet tore through the head of a 23-year-old guard for the state-funded Iraqi Media Network, who was standing on a balcony across an open traffic circle. Another guard rushed to his colleague's side and was fatally shot in the neck. A third guard was found dead more than an hour later on the same balcony.

Eight people who responded to the shootings -- including media network and Justice Ministry guards and an Iraqi army commander -- and five network officials in the compound said none of the slain guards had fired on the Justice Ministry, where a U.S. diplomat was in a meeting. An Iraqi police report described the shootings as ""an act of terrorism"" and said Blackwater ""caused the incident."" The media network concluded that the guards were killed ""without any provocation.""

The U.S. government reached a different conclusion. Based on information from the Blackwater guards, who said they were fired upon, the State Department determined that the security team's actions ""fell within approved rules governing the use of force,"" according to an official from the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Neither U.S. Embassy officials nor Blackwater representatives interviewed witnesses or returned to the network, less than a quarter-mile from Baghdad's Green Zone, to investigate.

The incident shows how American officials responsible for overseeing the security company conducted only a cursory investigation when Blackwater guards opened fire. The shooting occurred more than seven months before the Sept. 16 incident in which Blackwater guards killed 17 civilians at another Baghdad traffic circle.

The Feb. 7 shootings convulsed the Iraqi Media Network, one of the prominent symbols of the new Iraq, in anger and recrimination.

U.S. officials and the security company, now known as Blackwater Worldwide, offered no compensation or apology to the victims' families, according to relatives of the guards and officials of the network, whose programming reaches 22 million Iraqis.

""It's really surprising that Blackwater is still out there killing people,"" Mohammed Jasim, the Iraqi Media Network's deputy director, said in an interview. ""This company came to Iraq and was supposed to provide security. They didn't learn from their mistakes. They continued and continued. They continued killing.""

A Blackwater spokeswoman, Anne E. Tyrrell, said the company's guards came under ""precision small-arms fire"" and fired back with ""well-aimed shots."" The company was unable to comment further because of operational security and contractual obligations, she said. ""This was absolutely a provoked incident,"" Tyrrell said.

U.S. officials were ""overwhelmingly convinced"" that the Blackwater guards acted appropriately, based on information they had provided, according to the diplomatic security official. He spoke on condition of anonymity because a joint U.S.-Iraqi commission is investigating private security matters, including previous Blackwater shootings. Shortly after the Feb. 7 incident, the official said, the U.S. Embassy briefed an Iraqi government official and invited him to discuss the matter further, but the embassy never heard from him again.

Under State Department rules for the use of force, security contractors are authorized to use deadly force only if there is no safe alternative and the guards or the people they are protecting face ""imminent and grave danger."" The Blackwater guards said they came under fire from the building and responded, the security official said.

""The embassy conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the whole shooting incident and essentially what happened is, after going over all the reports, interviewing all the personnel that were involved in it, talking with people that were coming back in the motorcade, they concluded that the actions of the security team fell within the approved rules,"" the official said.

""To say Blackwater was the only source of information for this investigation is completely false,"" the security official added. U.S. officials declined to say who else was contacted as part of the probe or to provide any details about the assertions of Blackwater guards that they came under fire.

The Iraqi Interior Ministry has forwarded information about the Feb. 7 incident and five other fatal shootings involving Blackwater to the U.S. Embassy, which never responded, it said.

The Iraqi Media Network sought to sue Blackwater in an Iraqi court, according to Faisal Rahdi, the network's legal adviser. A judge rejected the petition, he said, citing a 2004 law signed by L. Paul Bremer, the administrator for the now-defunct U.S. occupation authority. That law, which the Iraqi government has moved to overturn, granted contractors immunity from the Iraqi legal process.

An internal review of the State Department's handling of private security recently found serious deficiencies in the agency's supervision of contractors, including Blackwater. The State Department's security chief, Richard J. Griffin, was forced to resign last month after the report was released.

The Feb. 7 incident was one of at least 10 fatal shootings involving Blackwater since June 2005, including three that led to confrontations between the security company and the Iraqi government in the months before the pivotal Sept. 16 incident at Nisoor Square.

Blackwater provides security for State Department employees traveling in Iraq. The company has received more than $1 billion in U.S. government contracts since 2001, including $832 million for security services in Iraq over the past two years. Blackwater employs 861 guards in Baghdad, according to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

The Iraqi Media Network shootings were particularly sensitive because Blackwater fired from one Iraqi government compound into another. The network is a state-funded corporation modeled after the BBC and launched by the U.S. government. After the March 2003 invasion, the network replaced the state-run television system that once dispensed propaganda for the government of then-President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi Media Network operates several newspapers, radio stations and a flagship TV network, al-Iraqiya.

""What really shocked us is that our colleagues were killed inside their workplace, in a place that was supposed to be secure,"" said Abbas A. Salim, the network's news director. ""The IMN, its main job is to explain democracy to the people and support the new Iraq.""

News of the shootings was broadcast on al-Iraqiya, which reaches about 85 percent of Iraq's population.

'Nabras Is Hit!'
On the morning of the incident, a convoy of four armored SUVs pulled up at a traffic circle that separates the Justice Ministry from the back of the Iraqi Media Network's sprawling compound. About 20 Blackwater guards got out of the vehicles, according to witnesses.

""Before they went inside, they asked me what this other building was,"" said Nadim Salim, a bodyguard at the Justice Ministry. ""I told them, 'That's the Iraqiya network.'""

Blackwater snipers set up on the Justice Ministry roof, taking cover behind concrete walls that crown the seven-story building. Blackwater ""had full control over the guys at Iraqiya because they were higher than them,"" Salim said.

Across the circle, Nabras Mohammed Hadi manned his guard position. He sat on a chair on the third-floor balcony of an abandoned building looking out on the Justice Ministry and King Faisal Circle, near the rear gate of the Iraqi Media Network compound. The traffic circle, which features a statue of the king on horseback, connects to Haifa Street, a notoriously dangerous central Baghdad thoroughfare.

Hadi had been living inside the Iraqi Media Network complex because insurgents had threatened to kill him unless he left his state-supported job, according to Mohammed Adel Ali, a friend and fellow guard.

Hadi was dressed in dark-green military camouflage and held an AK-47 assault rifle. On the same balcony, about 20 feet to his left, another network guard manned a belt-fed machine gun. Two guard towers overlooked the network's rear gate, one flying the Iraqi flag. Hadi was positioned below the snipers, who stood about 450 feet away, near a large Iraqi flag on top of the Justice Ministry.

Hadi stood up in response to a commotion that suddenly broke out in the circle, according to several of his fellow guards. The time was between 11 a.m. and noon. ""The problem started because some people wanted to park their car there,"" said one guard, Adel Saadi. ""Our guards didn't allow them, because we were worried about car bombs. But they kept insisting.""

Hadi yelled at the civilians to move back, according to Ali, who was also nearby. ""He was shouting: 'Move away from here. You can't stay here. This is a government building.' While he was shouting, he was holding his gun in a ready position. That's when the sniper shot him.""

It remains unclear what precipitated the shooting. The Blackwater guards said they came under fire from the building and responded, the diplomatic security official and the Blackwater spokeswoman said. Hadi's colleagues said he never fired his weapon. Saadi said he heard one shot, looked up and saw Hadi falling.

Saadi and Ali raced up the stairs with several other guards, Ali yelling: ""Nabras is hit! Nabras is hit!"" The guards said they believed the compound was under attack from insurgents. ""We never thought that people would be shooting at us from the Ministry of Justice,"" said Hussein Abdul Hassan, the guards' chief. ""It's a government building. No one would expect it.""

The guards crawled toward Hadi, shielded by a three-foot-high wall. The sniper was still firing, they said. ""Anyone crawling or walking, he shot at them,"" Hassan said. At least three bullets lodged in the building's facade. The guards found Hadi in the corner with a bullet through his head.

As they tried to move him, another shot rang out. It struck Azhar Abdullah al-Maliki, 31, another guard. His colleagues said he had raised his head above the low wall and was shot.

The Blackwater guards said they believed they were again under immediate threat and responded with lethal force, the security official said.

Maliki's older brother, Zuhair, said Maliki had taken the job just six weeks earlier. He lived with 21 members of his family, including his wife and three children, in a tiny house in Sadr City, a Baghdad slum.

Maliki slumped to the ground next to Hadi. ""People were yelling, 'Azhar, what's wrong?' "" Hassan said. ""When they went to move him, they saw the blood spurting from his neck.""

The guards quickly withdrew, ceding authority to an Iraqi army company that controls the neighborhood, Salihiya. The company commander, Capt. Ahmed Thamir Abood, said he sent soldiers up to the balcony to recover the bodies. Hadi was dead. Maliki was evacuated to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead of a gunshot wound to the neck at 2 p.m., according to his death certificate.

Abood, a short, stocky man who speaks halting English, said he learned from the Justice Ministry that snipers from a U.S. security company -- not insurgents -- had shot the guards. He drove in a Humvee with one of his lieutenants to the ministry. The Blackwater guards were gathered in the traffic circle, he said, preparing to leave. Most were stocky, with goatees and small communication devices in their ears.

""I told them, 'I want to speak with the guy who is in charge of this unit,' "" he said.

The Blackwater guards started toying with him, Abood said.

""He's in charge,"" said one, pointing at one of his colleagues.

""No, he's in charge,"" said another.

""They didn't care what I was saying,"" Abood said.

Abood said he spotted an American who appeared to be the diplomat being escorted by Blackwater. The man was young, perhaps in his 30s, and wore a navy blue sport coat, a tie and a combat helmet, Abood said. He tried to approach the diplomat, but the Blackwater guards stood in his way, he said.

Abood said he spoke to another Blackwater guard. ""I introduced myself in English, but he didn't even look at me,"" he said. ""I told him there are two people dead up there. He told me, 'Wait by this guy.' Then that guy told me to wait by another guy.""

Abood said he was still waiting when the Blackwater guards climbed inside their vehicles, set off smoke grenades in the circle and sped away in a green-and-orange cloud toward the Green Zone.

Security contractors are instructed to leave the scene of a shooting as quickly as possible to ensure the safety of the person under their protection, according to the diplomatic security official. The Blackwater team followed standard operating procedures, the official said.

'Abu Sajad Is Dead'
Pandemonium had broken out inside the media network compound. Hundreds of employees were locked down inside the buildings, afraid of more shooting. A leader of the guard team, Thair Salaam, tried to assemble his men. He noticed that one was missing: a 40-year-old armorer named Sabah Salman, also known as Abu Sajad.

""We couldn't find him, no one could find him,"" Salaam said. ""Then suddenly we got a call: 'Abu Sajad is dead.' That was more than an hour after the first shooting.""

Guards found Salman's body on the balcony. He had been shot in the side. Salaam said he believed Salman was shot by a sniper while trying to retrieve Hadi's weapon.

""He went up there without a gun,"" Salaam said. ""I don't know why they shot him.""

Salman, like the two other guards, was poor, his colleagues said. He had taken responsibility for a second family after his brother was killed during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. He helped support 17 children, including eight of his own. Salman was diabetic and often sick, according to fellow guard Mohammed Adel Ali.

He and the other guards earned 285,000 Iraqi dinars a month, about $231. That was less than half of what Blackwater security guards earn in a day.

Jasim, the Iraqi Media Network deputy director, said the company was uncertain where to turn.

The Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry, the Iraq police and an Iraqi Media Network internal investigation identified Blackwater's involvement in the shootings.

""On Feb. 7, members of Blackwater opened fire from the roof of the Ministry of Justice building, intentionally and without any provocation, shooting three members of our security team which led to their deaths while they were on duty inside the network complex,"" the Iraqi Media Network report concluded.

A Salihiya police investigator, misspelling Blackwater, wrote: ""By collecting information and questioning the Ministry of Justice guards, it became clear that the armed personnel, who came to the Ministry of Justice, who were using special security vehicles and caused the incident and killed guards of the Iraqi Media Network, they are working with the company of BlackRwatey for special security.""

""But these people were not well known to us,"" Jasim said. ""We don't know where they are located or who they report to. Are they at the Green Zone, at the airport? We don't know how to contact them.""

Abbas, the news director, said he called a U.S. military official, who told him that the military had no information about the incident.

Follow-up investigations can be difficult in a war zone environment, the diplomatic security official said. ""The State Department investigates security contractor incident scenes except when to do so would endanger the lives of the investigators,"" he said, adding that he was not specifically addressing the Feb. 7 incident.

The network gave the families of each of the victims 1 million dinars, or about $812, to assist with burial. The network then hired one member from each family to make up for the lost income.

The diplomatic security official said the U.S. government offered no compensation because the investigation concluded that the Blackwater guards fired in self-defense. ""It is the State Department policy to offer ex gratia condolence payments when innocent civilians have been hurt,"" he said. ""In this case, the investigation determined that the security detail had been fired upon, and therefore the issue of payments did not arise.""

Rahdi, the legal adviser, said the company had hoped to recover more money for the families by suing Blackwater. But he said CPA Order 17, the law granting contractors immunity, made it impossible.

""I'm talking to you from my point of view as someone representing the law,"" Rahdi said. ""Even if I go to the U.S. ambassador, even if I go to Bush, they go by the law. If there is no law to go after them -- what are they going to do?""

""America doesn't need more enemies in Iraq,"" he added. ""When someone loses one of his relatives, or one of his friends who gets killed by an American and that American is protected -- untouchable -- because of a law that was set by an American, this definitely will create new enemies for the United States.""

Jasim said he is still hopeful that Blackwater or the U.S. government will provide assistance.

""Those three people were killed in cold blood,"" he said. ""They have families to support. They should at least forward a letter of apology so we can give that to their relatives. That would give them some relief."""
146,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"Guards employed by Unity Resources Group, a security company responsible for the shooting deaths of two Iraqi women here Oct. 9, had shot and seriously wounded a man driving a van 3 1/2 months earlier on the same Baghdad thoroughfare, according to four witnesses.

The company that hired Unity, RTI International, a North Carolina-based firm that promotes democracy in Iraq under a U.S. government contract, initially said it had no information about the previously undisclosed June 24 shooting. RTI later said it discovered internal reports about the incident following detailed inquiries from The Washington Post.

The case demonstrates how security companies such as Unity operate in a lawless void in Iraq, with many shooting incidents escaping official or public scrutiny. The lack of oversight is the focus of a joint U.S.-Iraqi commission on the use of private security contractors that was formed after guards for Blackwater Worldwide killed 17 civilians in Baghdad on Sept. 16.

RTI said Unity conducted a two-month investigation into the June 24 shooting but later deleted references to a casualty from its records because it was unable to identify the victim. ""The incident was reported through formal channels at the time,"" RTI spokesman Patrick Gibbons said. Unity referred all questions about the case to RTI.

None of the witnesses interviewed by The Post said they had been contacted by Unity or RTI. Three of the witnesses described how the van driver's hand was nearly severed but said they never learned his identity.

Most of the more than 100 security firms in Iraq work under contracts or subcontracts for government agencies, private companies or individuals, creating layers of responsibility that make oversight difficult. Unity effectively regulates itself: The company reported 38 weapons-discharge incidents while protecting RTI employees over the past two years, according to a source familiar with the data. In each instance, the company conducted its own investigation.

RTI, a not-for-profit research company that has received at least $480 million for its efforts to strengthen local governance in Iraq, said it reports the incidents to its own employer, the U.S. Agency for International Development. But USAID, which is affiliated with the State Department, does not investigate, according to USAID and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

""USAID does not direct the security arrangements of its contractors,"" said Mirembe Nantongo, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman. ""The contractor is contractually responsible for the safety of its employees. That's as far as the connection goes. If you want more details, I would refer you to RTI.""

In the June 24 incident, Unity's guards raked a white van with automatic-weapons fire around 7 a.m. near a kindergarten on Karrada Street, a six-lane boulevard in central Baghdad. Witnesses said they used a crowbar to free the driver from the vehicle after he crashed into a lamppost. They said his left hand hung limply, attached only by skin. The man was semi-conscious when he was taken to the hospital in a civilian vehicle, the witnesses said.

""This guy, he wasn't doing anything threatening, but he didn't see them, so they shot him,"" said Amir Thamir, 28, who works at al-Mehdi bakery, about 20 yards from where the incident occurred.

On Oct. 9, about 250 yards up the same street, Unity guards sprayed a white Oldsmobile with dozens of bullets, killing two women in an incident that drew international attention because it occurred three weeks after the Blackwater shooting.



Unity said at the time that its guards opened fire after the driver failed to respond to warning signals. Through RTI, the company offered the same explanation for the June 24 incident.

The area where the incidents occurred is near a fortified complex, known as the Marble compound, that is used by Unity and RTI personnel. Unity convoys frequently drive along Karrada Street, shuttling RTI personnel to and from Baghdad's Green Zone.

Merchants along Karrada Street, the main artery of an affluent retail district, said the area has become a virtual shooting gallery for armed guards traveling in sport-utility vehicles. ""Whoever gets near them, they will shoot at them,"" said Sirry Abdul Latif, 50, a furniture shop employee, who said there had been several such shootings in the neighborhood.

A third incident occurred in the spring along the same stretch of Karrada Street in front of a popular social club, according to seven witnesses. An unidentified private security guard opened fire on a white Toyota sedan, the witnesses said, killing a male driver with a shot to the chest before speeding away. There was no indication that Unity was involved in that shooting.

Unity Resources Group is run by Australians, including former military personnel. It is headquartered in Dubai and registered in Singapore. RTI has paid the company nearly $50 million, according to RTI figures. Unity also provides security for the National Democratic Institute, a U.S. taxpayer-funded organization that conducts democracy projects in Iraq under a State Department contract.

""What we liked about URG, first of all, is that they were considered to be a little more mature,"" said John Lister, the former Iraq country director for the National Democratic Institute.

Unity guards have come under attack on numerous occasions; the company's co-director once described driving through Baghdad as ""like being on a 'Mad Max' film set."" Insurgents ambushed one of the company's convoys in January in Baghdad, killing a 28-year-old Ohio woman employed by the institute.

Ronald W. Johnson, RTI's executive vice president for international development, said RTI hired Unity partly because it was licensed by the Iraqi Interior Ministry. ""We wanted a security firm that we were comfortable working with"" and was also ""registered to do business in Iraq,"" Johnson said in an interview. USAID approved Unity's contract with RTI, Johnson said.

But the licensing process does not give the Iraqi government authority over contractors, and many companies forgo a license. A 2004 law signed by L. Paul Bremer, administrator for the now-defunct U.S. occupation government, granted security contractors immunity from the Iraqi legal process. That law is still in effect.

Unity's convoys are tracked by the U.S. military through the Reconstruction Operations Center in the Green Zone. By participating in the tracking system, the company agrees to report all shooting incidents to the military. But the U.S. military has no authority over Unity because the company is not under a Defense Department contract.

In an interview, Maj. Kent Lightner of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who directs the tracking system, suggested that the reporting requirements are difficult to enforce with respect to a company such as Unity.

""The real issue is that URG is a company that is not a DoD contractor, so whether they reported incidents or not is --"" Lightner paused. ""I don't know, I'm walking the line on that one,"" he said.

Lightner said military investigators requested information about Unity's movements on Oct. 9, when the company's guards killed the two women on Karrada Street. ""You're going to find out or sooner or later if they're playing by the rules or not,"" he said.

But a military spokesman, Navy Capt. Victor Beck, said he was unaware of any U.S. government investigation into that shooting incident or any other involving Unity. RTI and the U.S. Embassy said Unity is cooperating with Iraqi authorities.

The June 24 incident illustrates how gaps in oversight can preclude a thorough investigation.

Four witnesses said the Unity convoy opened fire after encountering the white van while traveling westbound in light, early morning traffic. One witness said the van was 40 to 60 yards behind the convoy after entering Karrada Street from a side road. The Unity guards waved two red flags to warn the driver, then quickly opened fire, according to the witness, a local resident who requested anonymity for security reasons.

The van swerved to the right and crashed into a lamppost, according to Thamir, the al-Mehdi bakery worker, and Tahir Sia, 75, who also works there. After wrenching open the passenger-side door, Thamir and Sia said, they pulled out the injured driver, who had white hair, appeared to be about 60 and was covered in blood. The man's left wrist was slashed diagonally, according to Thamir.

""He was probably hit on other parts of his body, but the major wound was on his arm,"" Thamir said.

Thamir and Sia said that local police never questioned them about the incident and that the man's fate and identity were unknown. Police in Karrada, leafing through a large, handwritten logbook with pages spilling from its spine, said they were unable to find a record of the incident.

Word of the shooting spread through the Green Zone ""like wildfire,"" said a former RTI employee who requested anonymity out of concern that he would jeopardize future employment as a government contractor.



After the Oct. 9 shooting, The Postwas told about an earlier Unity incident on Karrada Street that had caused one or more casualties. RTI initially said it had no information about such a shooting, but later said it discovered internal records of the incident after The Post provided the witnesses' detailed accounts.

""We are aware of an incident in which shots were fired at a white van on June 24, 2007,"" Gibbons, the company spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. ""A convoy was approached by a white van that failed to heed escalated warnings (arm signals, flares and warning shots). Shots were then fired, and the van was disabled along the median.""

Gibbons wrote that Unity had conducted a ""two-month investigation"" but was unable to find any information indicating that a casualty had occurred.

Informed that several witnesses had said the van's driver incurred serious injuries, Gibbons e-mailed an amended report from Willard E. Marsden Jr., RTI's director for international security.

According to that report, one of Unity's Iraqi guards ""witnessed the victim being placed into a privately owned vehicle. It was understood that the vehicle would transport the victim to the hospital.""

When an Iraqi employee was later dispatched to the hospital, he was ""unable to find either the victim or any indication that he had been treated and/or released.""

As a result, Marsden wrote, ""later URG reports deleted the reference to the victim being taken to the hospital."""
147,WP,Steve Fainaru,2008,Iraq Private Security ,"The U.S. government disregarded numerous warnings over the past two years about the risks of using Blackwater Worldwide and other private security firms in Iraq, expanding their presence even after a series of shooting incidents showed that the firms were operating with little regulation or oversight, according to government officials, private security firms and documents.

The warnings were conveyed in letters and memorandums from defense and legal experts and in high-level discussions between U.S. and Iraqi officials. They reflected growing concern about the lack of control over the tens of thousands of private guards in Iraq, the largest private security force ever employed by the United States in wartime.

Neither the Pentagon nor the State Department took substantive action to regulate private security companies until Blackwater guards opened fire Sept. 16 at a Baghdad traffic circle, killing 17 Iraqi civilians and provoking protests over the role of security contractors in Iraq.

""Why is it they couldn't see this coming?"" said Christopher Beese, chief administrative officer for ArmorGroup International, a British security firm with extensive operations in Iraq. ""That amazes me. Somebody -- it could have been military officers, it could have been State -- anybody could have waved a flag and said, 'Stop, this is not good news for us.' ""

Private security firms rushed into Iraq after the March 2003 invasion. The U.S. military, which entered the country with 130,000 troops, needed additional manpower to protect supply convoys, military installations and diplomats. Private security companies appeared ""like mushrooms after a rainstorm,"" recalled Michael J. Arrighi, who has worked in private security in Iraq since 2004.

Last year, the Pentagon estimated that 20,000 hired guns worked in Iraq; the Government Accountability Office estimated 48,000.

On Feb. 7, 2006, Blackwater guards allegedly killed three Kurdish civilians outside the northern city of Kirkuk. That incident triggered demonstrations outside the U.S. Consulate and led Rizgar Ali, president of the Kirkuk provincial council, to complain to U.S. authorities in Kirkuk and Baghdad, Ali said in an interview. The incident was one of several shootings that caused friction between the U.S. and Iraqi governments..

On Christmas Eve 2006, a Blackwater employee killed the bodyguard of an Iraqi vice president in the Green Zone. Six weeks later, a Blackwater sniper killed three security guards for the state-run media network. On May 24, a Blackwater team shot and killed a civilian driver outside the Interior Ministry gates, sparking an armed standoff between the Blackwater guards and Iraqi security forces in downtown Baghdad.

By June 6, concerns about Blackwater had reached Iraq's National Intelligence Committee, which included senior Iraqi and U.S. intelligence officials, including Maj. Gen. David B. Lacquement, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence. Maj. Gen. Hussein Kamal, who heads the Interior Ministry's intelligence directorate, called on U.S. authorities to crack down on private security companies.

U.S. military officials told Kamal that Blackwater was under State Department authority and outside their control, according to notes of the meeting. The matter was dropped.

""We set this thing up for failure from the beginning,"" said T.X. Hammes, a retired Marine colonel who advised the new Iraqi army from January to March 2004. He added that private security guards regularly infuriated his Iraqi staff with their aggressive tactics and that he reported the problems ""up the chain of command.""

""We're just sorting it out now,"" Hammes said. ""I still think, from a pure counterinsurgency standpoint, armed contractors are an inherently bad idea, because you cannot control the quality, you cannot control the action on the ground, but you're held responsible for everything they do.""

U.S. officials argue that security contractors save money and free up troops for more urgent tasks, such as fighting insurgents. ""Certainly there have been moments of frustration where people here have said, 'Maybe we should just take over the whole operation, even if it stretches our forces more,' "" Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. ""But the reality is that we think our resources are better utilized taking it to the bad guys than guarding warehouses and escorting convoys.""

The State Department investigated previous Blackwater shootings and found no indication of wrongdoing, according to a senior official involved in security matters. He said the U.S. Embassy discussed any concerns the Iraqi government had about the company's conduct. ""I'm not aware of the significant warnings,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of ongoing investigations related to the Sept. 16 shooting.

The Defense Department has paid $2.7 billion for private security since 2003, according to USA Spending, a government-funded project that tracks contracting expenditures; the military said it currently employs 17 companies in Iraq under contracts worth $689.7 million. The State Department has paid $2.4 billion for private security in Iraq -- including $1 billion to Blackwater -- since 2003, USA Spending figures show.

On Dec. 5, the State and Defense departments signed a memorandum of agreement designed to increase cooperation between the two and better define their authority over private security contractors. The nine-page agreement, which was approved by Ryan C. Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces there, for the first time set common guidelines for reporting serious incidents, the use of deadly force, coordination on the battlefield and possession of firearms.

But the laws governing security contractors still have not been clarified. On Sept. 30, 2006, Congress passed a provision aimed at giving the military authority over all contractors in Iraq, including Blackwater. But the provision has not been implemented by the Pentagon. The 15-month delay ""has led to much confusion over who will be covered . . . and has called into question whether the Department plans to utilize this provision,"" Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who sponsored the provision, wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates shortly after the Sept. 16 incident.

The Pentagon is studying whether the provision can withstand legal scrutiny, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said.

Contractors in Combat
In previous wars, the Pentagon had prohibited contractors from participating in combat. But in Iraq, military planners rewrote the policy to match the reality on the ground. On Sept. 20, 2005, the military issued an order authorizing contractors to use deadly force to protect people and assets. In June 2006, the order was codified as an ""interim rule"" in the Federal Register. It took effect immediately without public debate.

Critics, including the American Bar Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warned that the Pentagon had used an obscure defense acquisition rule to push through a fundamental shift in American war-fighting without fully considering the potential legal and strategic ramifications.

The provision enabled the military to significantly raise troop levels with contractors whose ""combat roles now closely parallel those of Constitutionally and Congressionally authorized forces,"" wrote Herbert L. Fenster, a partner with McKenna Long & Aldridge, a Washington-based international law firm that represents several major defense contractors. Fenster questioned the provision's legality in a lengthy comment he filed in opposition. The practice ""smacks of a mercenary approach,"" he wrote in an e-mail.

But neither the military nor the State Department set guidelines for regulating tens of thousands of hired guns on the battlefield. Oversight was left to overburdened government contracting officers or the companies themselves, which conducted their own investigations when a shooting incident occurred. Dozens of security companies operated under layers of subcontracts that often made their activities all but impossible to track. They were accountable to no one for violent incidents, according to U.S. officials and security company representatives familiar with the contracting arrangements.

U.S. officials often turned to the Private Security Company Association of Iraq, a trade group funded by the security companies. Lawrence T. Peter, a retired Navy intelligence officer, served as the association's director while also working as a consultant to the Pentagon's Defense Reconstruction Support Office, which administers contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Whitman, the Pentagon spokesman, said Peter earned ""a few thousand dollars a year"" as a consultant.

The association operated out of an office inside the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Logistics Directorate in the Green Zone. Jack Holly, a retired Marine colonel who heads corps logistics in Iraq, said that Peter and the association play ""a critical role to help the private security community improve and regulate itself,"" adding, ""They tried to fill a void that had been left by the U.S. government's failure to recognize the problem.""

""The department didn't see him as an advocate"" for the security industry, Whitman said, referring to Peter. ""They saw him as a conduit for information to understand the role of private security contractors in the reconstruction process.""

But others saw a conflict of interest. ""It violates all the best lessons of what goes into good policy and smart business,"" said Peter W. Singer, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who has written a book on private security. ""You do not hand over these questions to parties that are not merely mildly interested but they're the ones you are seeking to regulate.""

The association sometimes resisted regulation. Earlier this year, Peter opposed the military's efforts to enforce orders requiring private security firms to obtain formal weapons permits from the Iraqi government, arguing that the authorization process was unworkable. Peter did not return messages seeking comment. His deputy, H.C. Lawrence Smith, said during an interview in Baghdad this year that the association sometimes helped the military in ""writing the language in contracts relating to the role that private security companies play. We don't care what the contract is about, as long as the companies are treated fairly.""

Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Scott, who oversees Pentagon contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the association had never ""provided any input on contract language."" He said he viewed it as a trade group that made unsolicited comments on policy on behalf of its membership. To employ Peter as a consultant, Scott said, ""wouldn't be proper.""

Fury and Frustration
On June 27, 2004, one day before he left Baghdad, L. Paul Bremer, administrator of the now-defunct U.S. occupation government, signed CPA Order 17, a decree granting contractors immunity from Iraqi law.

Two years later, Matthew Degn, a then-36-year-old civilian contractor from Seattle, arrived in Baghdad as a senior policy adviser to the Interior Ministry. One of his assignments was to help the Iraqis regulate private security. He started by reading CPA Order 17.

Degn, a no-nonsense Army veteran who had taught national security and terrorism studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, offered a blunt assessment of the document. ""You have no power,"" he told Iraqi officials.

Hostility toward Blackwater was already high in the Interior Ministry, which was dominated by Shiite militias. The February 2006 shooting incident in Kirkuk had damaged U.S.-Iraqi relations in the area, leaving the Americans ""hated and ostracized,"" according to Ali, the provincial council president.

Ali said he ""sent official letters to the American and the British consulates and met them in my office to find out who the murderers were. They didn't do anything or give me clear answers. They only said, 'The ones who did it were from the Blackwater company.' ""

A Blackwater spokeswoman did not respond to e-mails or phone messages seeking comment. U.S. officials said they could not recall the incident.

Blackwater, based in Moyock, N.C., was founded in 1996 by a former Navy SEAL, Erik Prince. In Iraq, the company protects the U.S. ambassador and other diplomats. Blackwater has lost 25 employees in Iraq, according to Labor Department figures based on insurance claims. The firm says no one under its protection has been killed.

The State Department's reliance on Blackwater expanded dramatically in 2006, when together with the U.S. firms DynCorp and Triple Canopy it won a new, multiyear contract worth $3.6 billion. Blackwater's share was $1.2 billion, up from $488 million, and the company more than doubled its staff, from 482 to 1,082. From January 2006 to April 2007, the State Department paid Blackwater at least $601 million in 38 transactions, according to government data.

The company developed a reputation for aggressive street tactics. Even inside the fortified Green Zone, Blackwater guards were known for running vehicles off the road and pointing their weapons at bystanders, according to several security company representatives and U.S. officials.

""They're universally despised in the"" Green Zone, said Arrighi, who has managed security for several companies since 2004. ""That's not an overstatement. 'Universally despised' is probably a kind way to put it.""

The Iraqis' fury grew as they realized that Blackwater was untouchable, Degn said. After the May 24 shooting of a civilian Iraqi driver outside the Interior Ministry gates, Blackwater guards refused to divulge their names or details of the incident to the Iraqi authorities. Degn, who was working in the ministry at the time, recalled that the Iraqis were outraged and the American advisers felt threatened.

""After that day, people looked at us a little different,"" Degn said. ""There was a palpable feeling. . . . We knew that something monumental had happened, that we were in deep water. And we felt like we weren't getting anything done. We were going up and coming down, but they weren't listening to a darn thing we were saying.""

The State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Blackwater became synonymous with private security, ""like Kleenex or Reynolds Wrap"" being used to describe generic products, and was blamed for incidents even when it wasn't involved. He said the shootings should be viewed in the context of the several thousand missions that Blackwater conducted safely on Baghdad's dangerous streets.

On June 6, Kamal, the deputy minister, brought up the issue of Blackwater before the National Intelligence Committee. The committee's weekly meetings at the Iraqi parliament were headed by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Iraq's national security adviser, and attended by several U.S. officials, including Lacquement, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence.

A spokesman for Lacquement, who is now commander of the Army Intelligence and Security Command, said that for ""reasons of classification and security,"" he could not address whether Blackwater was discussed.

""Clearly the overall philosophy and tactics of Blackwater were not in keeping with winning hearts and minds,"" said a senior defense official involved in private security policy. The company's aggressive tactics provoked widespread frustration among U.S. commanders in Iraq, but the complaints ""never got out of the brigade level"" until after the Sept. 16 incident, he said.

Kamal's pleas to do something about the private security firms went nowhere. ""Kamal was ballistic,"" Degn said. The May 24 shooting ""had happened right on Interior Ministry grounds. That's what made it so explosive. But once again, the Americans blew it off, so where are you going to take it after that?""

Degn said he was also frustrated. ""We sent many memos up the chain of command,"" he said. ""I thought it was a huge issue. The coalition knew about it, but it was just another part of the war, so nothing was ever done. I felt it was completely ignored.""

""I mean, how many of these incidents does it take before you're finally aware?"" Degn added.

'An Interesting Question'
In the spring of 2005, while on a one-year tour in Baghdad, Army Maj. Robert Bateman watched a Blackwater convoy barrel through a congested traffic circle, indiscriminately firing warning shots. Bateman, who frequently writes and blogs on military issues, described what he saw to his fiancee, Kate Turner, a first-year graduate student at Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.

On Dec. 5 that year, Turner decided to ask Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was visiting Johns Hopkins, what laws governed security contractors in Iraq.

""Iraq's a sovereign country. They have their laws, and they're going to govern,"" Rumsfeld replied.

Four months later, Turner raised the issue with President Bush when he visited the school.



""I asked your secretary of defense a couple months ago what law governs their actions,"" Turner said, according to a transcript of the exchange.

""I was going to ask him,"" the president responded, drawing laughter as he issued a mock entreaty. ""Go ahead. Help.""

""Mr. Rumsfeld answered that Iraq has its own domestic laws which he assumed applied to those private military contractors,"" Turner said. ""However, Iraq is clearly not capable of enforcing its laws. I would submit to you that this is one case that privatization is not a solution. And, Mr. President, how do you propose to bring private military contractors under a system of law?""

""I wasn't kidding. I was going to pick up the phone and say, 'Mr. Secretary, I've got an interesting question,' "" Bush replied. ""I don't mean to be dodging the questions, although it's kind of convenient in this case.""

Turner received a letter two weeks later from the Pentagon's Office of General Counsel. It directly contradicted Rumsfeld: ""Contractors are . . . subject to oversight and accountability for their actions on the basis of U.S. law and regulation.""

To date, not a single case has been brought against a private security contractor in Iraq. ""The reality is the military has not had any oversight on this issue until recently,"" Arrighi said. ""We could hire the Rockettes and give them guns, and they wouldn't know. It was a total wasteland.""

Special correspondent Naseer Nouri in Baghdad and staff researcher Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report."
148,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"Pakistan’s premier military intelligence agency has lost control of some of the networks of Pakistani militants it has nurtured since the 1980s, and is now suffering the violent blowback of that policy, two former senior intelligence officials and other officials close to the agency say.

As the military has moved against them, the militants have turned on their former handlers, the officials said. Joining with other extremist groups, they have battled Pakistani security forces and helped militants carry out a record number of suicide attacks last year, including some aimed directly at army and intelligence units as well as prominent political figures, possibly even Benazir Bhutto.

The growing strength of the militants, many of whom now express support for Al Qaeda’s global jihad, presents a grave threat to Pakistan’s security, as well as NATO efforts to push back the Taliban in Afghanistan. American officials have begun to weigh more robust covert operations to go after Al Qaeda in the lawless border areas because they are so concerned that the Pakistani government is unable to do so.

The unusual disclosures regarding Pakistan’s leading military intelligence agency — Inter-Services Intelligence, or the ISI — emerged in interviews last month with former senior Pakistani intelligence officials. The disclosures confirm some of the worst fears, and suspicions, of American and Western military officials and diplomats.

The interviews, a rare glimpse inside a notoriously secretive and opaque agency, offered a string of other troubling insights likely to refocus attention on the ISI’s role as Pakistan moves toward elections on Feb. 18 and a battle for control of the government looms:

One former senior Pakistani intelligence official, as well as other people close to the agency, acknowledged that the ISI led the effort to manipulate Pakistan’s last national election in 2002, and offered to drop corruption cases against candidates who would back President Pervez Musharraf.

A person close to the ISI said Mr. Musharraf had now ordered the agency to ensure that the coming elections were free and fair, and denied that the agency was working to rig the vote. But the acknowledgment of past rigging is certain to fuel opposition fears of new meddling.

The two former high-ranking intelligence officials acknowledged that after Sept. 11, 2001, when President Musharraf publicly allied Pakistan with the Bush administration, the ISI could not rein in the militants it had nurtured for decades as a proxy force to exert pressure on India and Afghanistan. After the agency unleashed hard-line Islamist beliefs, the officials said, it struggled to stop the ideology from spreading.

Another former senior intelligence official said dozens of ISI officers who trained militants had come to sympathize with their cause and had had to be expelled from the agency. He said three purges had taken place since the late 1980s and included the removal of three ISI directors suspected of being sympathetic to the militants.

None of the former intelligence officials who spoke to The New York Times agreed to be identified when talking about the ISI, an agency that has gained a fearsome reputation for interfering in almost every aspect of Pakistani life. But two former American intelligence officials agreed with much of what they said about the agency’s relationship with the militants.

So did other sources close to the ISI, who admitted that the agency had supported militants in Afghanistan and Kashmir, although they said they had been ordered to do so by political leaders.

The former intelligence officials appeared to feel freer to speak as Mr. Musharraf’s eight years of military rule weakened, and as a power struggle for control over the government looms between Mr. Musharraf and opposition political parties.

The officials were interviewed before the assassination of Ms. Bhutto, the opposition leader, on Dec. 27. Since then, the government has said that Pakistani militants linked to Al Qaeda are the foremost suspects in her killing. Her supporters have accused the government of a hidden hand in the attack.

While the author of Ms. Bhutto’s death remains a mystery, the interviews with the former intelligence officials made clear that the agency remained unable to control the militants it had fostered.

The threat from the militants, the former intelligence officials warned, is one that Pakistan is unable to contain. “We could not control them,” said one former senior intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We indoctrinated them and told them, ‘You will go to heaven.’ You cannot turn it around so suddenly.”

The Context
After 9/11, the Bush administration pressed Mr. Musharraf to choose a side in fighting Islamist extremism and to abandon Pakistan’s longtime support for the Taliban and other Islamist militants.

In the 1990s, the ISI supported the militants as a proxy force to contest Indian-controlled Kashmir, the border territory that India and Pakistan both claim, and to gain a controlling influence in neighboring Afghanistan. In the 1980s, the United States supported militants, too, funneling billions of dollars to Islamic fighters battling Soviet forces in Afghanistan through the ISI, vastly increasing the agency’s size and power.

Publicly, Mr. Musharraf agreed to reverse course in 2001, and he has received $10 billion in aid for Pakistan since then in return. In an interview in November, he vehemently defended the conduct of the ISI, an agency that, according to American officials, was under his firm control for the last eight years while he served as both president and army chief.

Mr. Musharraf dismissed criticism of the ISI’s relationship with the militants. He cited the deaths of 1,000 Pakistani soldiers and police officers in battles with the militants in recent years — as well as several assassination attempts against himself — as proof of the seriousness of Pakistan’s counterterrorism effort.

“It is quite illogical if you think those people who have suffered 1,000 people dead, and I who have been attacked thrice or four or five times, that I would be supportive towards Taliban, towards Al Qaeda,” Mr. Musharraf said. “These are ridiculous things that discourages and demoralizes.”

But some former American intelligence officials have argued that Mr. Musharraf and the ISI never fully jettisoned their militant protégés, and instead carried on a “double-game.” They say Mr. Musharraf cooperated with American intelligence agencies to track down foreign Qaeda members while holding Taliban commanders and Kashmiri militants in reserve.

In order to undercut major opposition parties, he wooed religious conservatives, according to analysts. And instead of carrying out a crackdown, Mr. Musharraf took half-measures.

“I think he would make a decision when a situation arises,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a leading Pakistani military analyst, referring to militants openly confronting the government. “But before that he would not alienate any side.

There is little dispute that Pakistan’s crackdown on the militants has been at best uneven, but key sources interviewed by The Times disagreed on why.

Most Western officials in Pakistan say they believe, as Pakistani officials, including President Musharraf, insist, that the agency is well disciplined, like the army, and is in no sense a rogue or out-of-control organization acting contrary to the policies of the leadership

A senior Western military official in Pakistan said that if the ISI was covertly aiding the Taliban, the decision would come from the top of the government, not the agency. “That’s not an ISI decision,” the official said. “That’s a government-of-Pakistan decision.”

But former Pakistani intelligence officials insisted that Mr. Musharraf had ordered a crackdown on all militants. It was never fully carried out, however, because of opposition within his government and within ISI, they said.

One former senior intelligence official said that some officials in the government and the ISI thought the militants should be held in reserve, as insurance against the day when American and NATO forces abandoned the region and Pakistan might again need them as a lever against India.

“We had a school of thought that favored retention of this capability,” the former senior intelligence official said.

Some senior ministers and officials in Mr. Musharraf’s government sympathized with the militants and protected them, former intelligence officials said. Still others advised a go-slow approach, fearing a backlash against the government from the militants

When arrests were ordered, the police refused to carry them out in some cases until they received written orders, believing the militants were still protected by the ISI, as they had been for years.

Inside the ISI, there was division as well. One part of the ISI hunted down militants, the officials said, while another continued to work with them. The result was confusion.

In interviews in 2002, Kashmiri militants in Pakistan said they had been told by the government to maintain a low profile and wait. But as Pakistani military operations in the tribal areas intensified, along with airstrikes by C.I.A.-operated drones, militant groups there issued highly charged and sometimes exaggerated accounts of women and children being killed

The first suicide bombing attack on a military target outside the tribal areas came days after an airstrike on a madrasa in the tribal area of Bajaur in October 2006 killed scores of people.

Another turning point came last July when Pakistani forces stormed the Red Mosque in Islamabad, where militants had armed themselves in a compound less than a mile from ISI headquarters and demanded the imposition of Islamic law. Government officials said that more than 100 people died. The militants have insisted that thousands did.

Several weeks later, militants carried out the first direct attacks on ISI employees. Suicide bombers twice attacked buses ferrying agency employees, killing 18 on Sept. 4 and 15 more on Nov. 24. According to Pakistani analysts, the attacks signaled that enraged militants had turned on their longtime patrons.

The Militant
One militant leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, typifies how extremists once trained by the ISI have broken free of the agency’s control, turned against the government and joined with other militants to create powerful new networks.

In 2000, Mr. Azhar received support from the ISI when he founded Jaish-e-Muhammad, or Army of Muhammad, a Pakistani militant group fighting Indian forces in Kashmir, according to Robert Grenier, who served as the Central Intelligence Agency station chief in Islamabad from 1999 to 2002. The ISI intermittently provided training and operational coordination to such groups, he said, but struggled to fully control them.

Mr. Musharraf banned Jaish-e-Muhammad and detained Mr. Azhar after militants carried out an attack on the Indian Parliament building in December 2001. Indian officials accused Jaish-e-Muhammad and another Pakistani militant group of masterminding the attack. After India massed hundreds of thousands of troops on Pakistan’s border, Mr. Musharraf vowed in a nationally televised speech that January to crack down on all militants in Pakistan.

“We will take strict action against any Pakistani who is involved in terrorism inside the country or abroad,” he said. Two weeks later, a British-born member of Mr. Azhar’s group, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, kidnapped Daniel Pearl, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who was beheaded by his captors. Mr. Sheikh surrendered to the ISI, the agency that had supported Jaish-e-Muhammad, and was sentenced to death for the kidnapping.

After Mr. Pearl’s killing, Pakistani officials arrested more than 2,000 people in a crackdown. But within a year, Mr. Azhar and most of the 2,000 militants who had been arrested were freed. “I never believed that government ties with these groups was being irrevocably cut,” said Mr. Grenier, now a managing director at Kroll, a risk consulting firm.

At the same time, Pakistan seemingly went “through the motions” when it came to hunting Taliban leaders who fled into Pakistan after the 2001 American invasion of Afghanistan, he said

Encouraged by the United States, the Pakistanis focused their resources on arresting senior Qaeda members, he said, which they successfully did from 2002 to 2005. Since then, arrests have slowed as Al Qaeda and other militant groups have become more entrenched in the tribal areas.

Asked in 2006 why the Pakistani government did not move against the leading Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, and his son Sirajuddin, who are based in the tribal areas and have long had links with Al Qaeda, one senior ISI official said it was because Pakistan needed to retain some assets of its own

That policy haunts Mr. Musharraf and the United States, according to American and Pakistani analysts. Today Pakistan’s tribal areas are host to a lethal stew of foreign Qaeda members, Uzbek militants, Taliban, ISI-trained Pakistani extremists, disgruntled tribesmen and new recruits.

The groups carried out a record number of suicide bombings in Pakistan and Afghanistan last year and have been tied to three major terrorist plots in Britain and Germany since 2005.

Mr. Azhar, who once served his ISI mentors in Kashmir, is thought to be hiding in the tribal area of Bajaur, or nearby Dir, and fighting Pakistani security forces, according to one former intelligence official. Militants who took part in the Red Mosque siege in Islamabad in July were closely affiliated with Mr. Azhar’s group. This fall, his group fielded fighters in the Swat Valley, the famous tourist spot, where the militants presented a challenge of new proportions to the government, seizing several districts and mounting battles against Pakistani forces that left scores dead.

One militant from a banned sectarian group who joined Mr. Azhar’s group, Qari Zafar, now trains insurgents in South Waziristan on how to rig roadside bombs and vests for suicide bombings, according to the former intelligence official.

Cooperation against the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan has improved since 2006, and three senior Taliban figures have been caught, according to Western officials and sources close to the ISI. Yet doubts remain about the Pakistani government’s intentions.

Senior provincial ISI officials continue to meet with high-level members of the Taliban in the border provinces, according to one Western diplomat. “It is not illogical to surmise that cooperation is on the agenda, and not just debriefing,” the diplomat said.

“There are groups they know they have lost control of,” the Western diplomat added. But the government moved only against those groups that have attacked the Pakistani state, the diplomat said, adding, “It seems very difficult for them to write them off.”

The Agency Now
Western officials say that before Mr. Musharraf resigned as army chief in December, he appointed a loyalist to run the ISI and appears determined to retain power over the agency even as a civilian president.

“For as long as he can, Musharraf will keep trying to control these organizations,” a Western diplomat said. “I don’t think we should expect this man to become an elder statesman as we know it.”

That puts Mr. Musharraf’s successor as army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who headed the ISI from 2004 to 2007, in a potentially pivotal position. General Kayani, a pro-American moderate, is loyal to Mr. Musharraf to a point, according to retired officers. But he will abandon him if he thinks Mr. Musharraf’s actions are significantly undermining the standing of the Pakistani army.

Mr. Musharraf will maintain control over the agency as long as his interests coincide with General Kayani’s, they said, while the new civilian prime minister who emerges from February’s elections is likely to have far less authority over the agency. Opposition political parties already accuse the agency of meddling in next month’s election. The Western diplomat called the ISI “the army’s dirty bag of tricks.”

Since Ms. Bhutto’s assassination, members of her party have accused government officials, including former ISI agents, of having a hidden hand in the attack or of knowing about a plot and failing to inform Ms. Bhutto.

American experts played down the chances of a government conspiracy against Ms. Bhutto. They also said it was unlikely that low-level or retired officers working alone or with militants carried out the attack.

But nearly half of Pakistanis said in a recent poll that they suspected that government agencies or pro-government politicians had assassinated Ms. Bhutto. Such suspicion stems from decades of interference in elections and politics by the ISI, according to analysts, as well as a high level of domestic surveillance, intimidation and threats to journalists, academics and human rights activists, which former intelligence officials also acknowledged.

Pakistani and American experts say that distrust speaks to the urgent need to reform a hugely powerful intelligence agency that Pakistan’s military rulers have used for decades to suppress political opponents, manipulate elections and support militant groups.

“Pakistan would certainly be better off if the ISI were never used for domestic political purposes,” said Mr. Grenier, the former C.I.A. Islamabad station chief. “That goes without saying.”

Pakistani analysts and Western diplomats argue that the country will remain unstable as long as the ISI remains so powerful and so unaccountable. The ISI has grown more powerful in each period of military rule, they said.

Civilian leaders, including Mrs. Bhutto, could not resist using it to secure their political aims, but neither could they control it. And the army continues to rely on the ISI for its own foreign policy aims, particularly battling India in Kashmir and seeking influence in Afghanistan.

“The question is, how do you change that?” asked one Western diplomat. “Their tentacles are everywhere.”"
149,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"Late last year, top Bush administration officials decided to take a step they had long resisted. They drafted a secret plan to make it easier for the Pentagon’s Special Operations forces to launch missions into the snow-capped mountains of Pakistan to capture or kill top leaders of Al Qaeda.

Intelligence reports for more than a year had been streaming in about Osama bin Laden’s terrorism network rebuilding in the Pakistani tribal areas, a problem that had been exacerbated by years of missteps in Washington and the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, sharp policy disagreements, and turf battles between American counterterrorism agencies.

The new plan, outlined in a highly classified Pentagon order, was intended to eliminate some of those battles. And it was meant to pave a smoother path into the tribal areas for American commandos, who for years have bristled at what they see as Washington’s risk-averse attitude toward Special Operations missions inside Pakistan. They also argue that catching Mr. bin Laden will come only by capturing some of his senior lieutenants alive.

But more than six months later, the Special Operations forces are still waiting for the green light. The plan has been held up in Washington by the very disagreements it was meant to eliminate. A senior Defense Department official said there was “mounting frustration” in the Pentagon at the continued delay.

After the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush committed the nation to a “war on terrorism” and made the destruction of Mr. bin Laden’s network the top priority of his presidency. But it is increasingly clear that the Bush administration will leave office with Al Qaeda having successfully relocated its base from Afghanistan to Pakistan’s tribal areas, where it has rebuilt much of its ability to attack from the region and broadcast its messages to militants across the world.

A recent American airstrike killing Pakistani troops has only inflamed tensions along the mountain border and added to tensions between Washington and Pakistan’s new government.

The story of how Al Qaeda, whose name is Arabic for “the base,” has gained a new haven is in part a story of American accommodation to President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, whose advisers played down the terrorist threat. It is also a story of how the White House shifted its sights, beginning in 2002, from counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan to preparations for the war in Iraq.

Just as it had on the day before 9/11, Al Qaeda now has a band of terrorist camps from which to plan and train for attacks against Western targets, including the United States. Officials say the new camps are smaller than the ones the group used prior to 2001. However, despite dozens of American missile strikes in Pakistan since 2002, one retired C.I.A. officer estimated that the makeshift training compounds now have as many as 2,000 local and foreign militants, up from several hundred three years ago.

Publicly, senior American and Pakistani officials have said that the creation of a Qaeda haven in the tribal areas was in many ways inevitable — that the lawless badlands where ethnic Pashtun tribes have resisted government control for centuries were a natural place for a dispirited terrorism network to find refuge. The American and Pakistani officials also blame a disastrous cease-fire brokered between the Pakistani government and militants in 2006.

But more than four dozen interviews in Washington and Pakistan tell another story. American intelligence officials say that the Qaeda hunt in Pakistan, code-named Operation Cannonball by the C.I.A. in 2006, was often undermined by bitter disagreements within the Bush administration and within the C.I.A., including about whether American commandos should launch ground raids inside the tribal areas.

Inside the C.I.A., the fights included clashes between the agency’s outposts in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Islamabad. There were also battles between field officers and the Counterterrorist Center at C.I.A. headquarters, whose preference for carrying out raids remotely, via Predator missile strikes, was derided by officers in the Islamabad station as the work of “boys with toys.”

An early arrangement that allowed American commandos to join Pakistani units on raids inside the tribal areas was halted in 2003 after protests in Pakistan. Another combat mission that came within hours of being launched in 2005 was scuttled because some C.I.A. officials in Pakistan questioned the accuracy of the intelligence, and because aides to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld believed that the mission force had become too large.

Current and former military and intelligence officials said that the war in Iraq consistently diverted resources and high-level attention from the tribal areas. When American military and intelligence officials requested additional Predator drones to survey the tribal areas, they were told no drones were available because they had been sent to Iraq.

Some former officials say Mr. Bush should have done more to confront Mr. Musharraf, by aggressively demanding that he acknowledge the scale of the militant threat.

Western military officials say Mr. Musharraf was instead often distracted by his own political problems, and effectively allowed militants to regroup by brokering peace agreements with them.

Even critics of the White House agree that there was no foolproof solution to gaining control of the tribal areas. But by most accounts the administration failed to develop a comprehensive plan to address the militant problem there, and never resolved the disagreements between warring agencies that undermined efforts to fashion any coherent strategy.

“We’re just kind of drifting,” said Richard L. Armitage, who as deputy secretary of state from 2001 to 2005 was the administration’s point person for Pakistan.

Fleeing U.S. Air Power
In March 2002, several hundred bedraggled foreign fighters — Uzbeks, Pakistanis and a handful of Arabs — fled the towering mountains of eastern Afghanistan and crossed into Pakistan’s South Waziristan tribal area.

Savaged by American air power in the battles of Tora Bora and the Shah-i-Kot valley, some were trying to make their way to the Arab states in the Persian Gulf. Some were simply looking for a haven.

They soon arrived at Shakai, a remote region in South Waziristan of tree-covered mountains and valleys. Venturing into nearby farming villages, they asked local tribesmen if they could rent some of the area’s walled family compounds, paying two to three times the impoverished area’s normal rates as the militants began to lay new roots.

“They slowly, steadily from the mountainside tried to establish communication,” recalled Mahmood Shah, the chief civilian administrator of the tribal areas from 2001 to 2005.

In many ways, the foreigners were returning to their home base. In the 1980s, Mr. bin Laden and hundreds of Arab and foreign fighters backed by the United States and Pakistan used the tribal areas as a staging area for cross-border attacks on Soviet forces in Afghanistan.

The militants’ flight did not go unnoticed by American intelligence agencies, which began to report beginning in the spring of 2002 that large numbers of foreigners appeared to be hiding in South Waziristan and neighboring North Waziristan.

But Gen. Ali Mohammad Jan Aurakzai, the commander of Pakistani forces in northwestern Pakistan, was skeptical. In an interview this year, General Aurakzai recalled that he regarded the warnings as “guesswork,” and said that his soldiers “found nothing,” even when they pushed into dozens of square miles of territory that neither Pakistani nor British forces had ever entered.

The general, a tall, commanding figure who was born in the tribal areas, was Mr. Musharraf’s main adviser on the border areas, according to former Pakistani officials. For years, he would argue that American officials exaggerated the threat in the tribal areas and that the Pakistani Army should avoid causing a tribal rebellion at all costs.

Former American intelligence officials said General Aurakzai’s sweeps were slow-moving and easily avoided by militants. Robert L. Grenier, the C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad from 1999 to 2002, said that General Aurakzai was dismissive of the reports because he and other Pakistani officials feared the kind of tribal uprising that could have been touched off by more intrusive military operations. “Aurakzai and others didn’t want to believe it because it would have been an inconvenient fact,” Mr. Grenier recalled.

Signs of Militants Regrouping
Until recent elections pushed Mr. Musharraf off center stage in Pakistan, senior Bush administration officials consistently praised his cooperation in the Qaeda hunt.

Beginning shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Musharraf had allowed American forces to use Pakistani bases to support the American invasion of Afghanistan, while Pakistani intelligence services worked closely with the C.I.A. in tracking down Qaeda operatives. But from their vantage point in Afghanistan, the picture looked different to American Special Operations forces who saw signs that the militants whom the Americans had driven out of Afghanistan were effectively regrouping on the Pakistani side of the border.

When American military officials proposed in 2002 that Special Operations forces be allowed to establish bases in the tribal areas, Pakistan flatly refused. Instead, a small number of “black” Special Operations forces — Army Delta Force and Navy Seal units — were allowed to accompany Pakistani forces on raids in the tribal areas in 2002 and early 2003.

That arrangement only angered both sides. American forces used to operating on their own felt that the Pakistanis were limiting their movements. And while Pakistani officials publicly denied the presence of Americans, local tribesmen spotted the Americans and protested

Under pressure from Pakistan, the Bush administration decided in 2003 to end the American military presence on the ground. In a recent interview, Mr. Armitage said he had supported the pullback in recognition of the political risks that Mr. Musharraf had already taken. “We were pushing them almost to the breaking point,” Mr. Armitage said.

The American invasion of Iraq in 2003 added another complicating factor, by cementing a view among Pakistanis that American forces in the tribal areas would be a prelude to an eventual American occupation.

To have insisted that American forces be allowed to cross from Afghanistan into Pakistan, Mr. Armitage added, “might have been a bridge too far.”

Dealing With Musharraf
Mr. Bush’s re-election in 2004 brought with it another problem once the president overhauled his national security team. By early 2005, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Mr. Armitage had resigned, joining George J. Tenet, who had stepped down earlier as director of central intelligence. Their departures left the administration with no senior officials with close personal relationships with Mr. Musharraf.

In order to keep pressure on the Pakistanis about the tribal areas, officials decided to have Mr. Bush raise the issue in personal phone calls with Mr. Musharraf.

The conversations backfired. Two former United States government officials say they were surprised and frustrated when instead of demanding action from Mr. Musharraf, Mr. Bush repeatedly thanked him for his contributions to the war on terrorism. “He never pounded his fist on the table and said, ‘Pervez you have to do this,’ ” said a former senior intelligence official who saw transcripts of the phone conversations. But another senior administration official defended the president, saying Mr. Bush had not gone easy on the Pakistani leader.

“I would say the president pushes quite hard,” said the official, who would speak about the confidential conversations only on condition of anonymity. At the same time, the official said Mr. Bush was keenly aware of the “unique burden” that rested on any head of state, and had the ability to determine “what the traffic will bear” when applying pressure to foreign leaders.

Tensions Within the C.I.A.
As attacks into Afghanistan by militants based in the tribal areas continued, tensions escalated between the C.I.A. stations in Kabul and Islamabad, whose lines of responsibility for battling terrorism were blurred by the porous border that divides Afghanistan and Pakistan, and whose disagreements reflected animosities between the countries.

Along with the Afghan government, the C.I.A. officers in Afghanistan expressed alarm at what they saw as a growing threat from the tribal areas. But the C.I.A. officers in Pakistan played down the problem, to the extent that some colleagues in Kabul said their colleagues in Islamabad were “drinking the Kool-Aid,” as one former officer put it, by accepting Pakistani assurances that no one could control the tribal areas.

On several occasions, senior C.I.A. officials at agency headquarters had to intervene to dampen tensions between the dueling C.I.A. outposts. Other intragovernmental battles raged at higher altitudes, most notably over the plan in early 2005 for a Special Operations mission intended to capture Ayman al-Zawahri, Mr. bin Laden’s top deputy, in what would have been the most aggressive use of American ground troops inside Pakistan. The New York Times disclosed the aborted operation in a 2007 article, but interviews since then have produced new details about the episode.

As described by current and former government officials, Mr. Zawahri was believed by intelligence officials to be attending a meeting at a compound in Bajaur, a tribal area, and the plan to send commandos to capture him had the support of Porter J. Goss, the C.I.A. director, and the Special Operations commander, Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal.

But even as members of the Navy Seals and Army Rangers in parachute gear were boarding C-130 cargo planes in Afghanistan, there were frenzied exchanges between officials at the Pentagon, Central Command and the C.I.A. about whether the mission was too risky. Some complained that the American commando force was too large, numbering more than 100, while others argued that the intelligence was from a single source and unreliable.

Mr. Goss urged the military to carry out the mission, and some C.I.A. officials in Washington even tried to give orders to execute the raid without informing Ryan C. Crocker, then the American ambassador in Islamabad. But other C.I.A. officials were opposed to the raid, including a former officer who said in an interview that he had “told the military guys that this thing was going to be the biggest folly since the Bay of Pigs.”

In the end, the mission was aborted after Mr. Rumsfeld refused to give his approval for it. The decision remains controversial, with some former officials seeing the episode as a squandered opportunity to capture a figure who might have led the United States to Mr. bin Laden, while others dismiss its significance, saying that there had been previous false alarms and that there remained no solid evidence that Mr. Zawahri was present.

Bin Laden Hunt at Dead End
By late 2005, many inside the C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia had reached the conclusion that their hunt for Mr. bin Laden had made little progress since Tora Bora.

Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., who at the time ran the C.I.A.’s clandestine operations branch, decided in late 2005 to make a series of swift changes to the agency’s counterterrorism operations.

He replaced Mr. Grenier, the former Islamabad station chief who in late 2004 took over as head of the agency’s Counterterrorist Center. The two men had barely spoken for months, and some inside the agency believed this personality clash was beginning to affect C.I.A. operations.

Mr. Grenier had worked to expand the agency’s counterterrorism focus, reinforcing operations in places like the Horn of Africa, Southeast Asia and North Africa. He also reorganized and renamed Alec Station, the secret C.I.A. unit formed in the 1990s to hunt Al Qaeda.

Mr. Grenier believed that the Counterterrorist Center and Alec Station had both grown very rapidly since 2001 and needed to be restructured to eliminate overlap.

But Mr. Rodriguez believed that the Qaeda hunt had lost its focus on Mr. bin Laden and the militant threat in Pakistan.

So he appointed a new head of the Counterterrorist Center, who has not been publicly identified, and sent dozens more C.I.A. operatives to Pakistan. The new push was called Operation Cannonball, and Mr. Rodriguez demanded urgency, but the response had a makeshift air.

There was nowhere to house an expanding headquarters staff, so giant Quonset huts were erected outside the cafeteria on the C.I.A.’s leafy Virginia campus to house a new team assigned to the bin Laden mission. In Pakistan, the new operation was staffed not only with C.I.A. operatives drawn from around the world, but also with recent graduates of “the Farm,” the agency’s training center at Camp Peary in Virginia.

“We had to put people out in the field who had less than ideal levels of experience,” one former senior C.I.A. official said. “But there wasn’t much to choose from.”

One reason for this, according to two former intelligence officials directly involved in the Qaeda hunt, was that by 2006 the Iraq war had drained away most of the C.I.A. officers with field experience in the Islamic world. “You had a very finite number” of experienced officers, said one former senior intelligence official. “Those people all went to Iraq. We were all hurting because of Iraq.”

Surge in Suicide Bombings
The increase had little impact in Pakistan, where militants only continued to gain strength. In the spring of 2006, Taliban leaders based in Pakistan launched an offensive in southern Afghanistan, increasing suicide bombings by sixfold and American and NATO casualty rates by 45 percent. At the same time, they assassinated tribal elders in Pakistan who were cooperating with the government.

Once again, Pakistani Army units launched a military campaign in the tribal areas. Once again, they suffered heavy casualties.

And once again, Mr. Musharraf turned to General Aurakzai to deal with the problem. Having retired from the Pakistani Army, General Aurakzai had become the governor of North-West Frontier Province, and he immediately began negotiating with the militants. On Sept. 5, 2006, General Aurakzai signed a truce with militants in North Waziristan, one in which the militants agreed to surrender to local tribes and carry out no further attacks in Afghanistan.

To help sell Washington on the deal, Mr. Musharraf brought General Aurakzai to the Oval Office several weeks later.

In a presentation to Mr. Bush, General Aurakzai advocated a strategy that would rely even more heavily on cease-fires, and said striking deals with the Taliban inside Afghanistan could allow American forces to withdraw from Afghanistan within seven years.

But the cease-fire in Waziristan had disastrous consequences. In the months after the agreement was signed, cross-border incursions from the tribal areas into Afghanistan rose by 300 percent. Some American officials began to refer to General Aurakzai as a “snake oil salesman.”

A Rising Terror Threat
By the fall of 2006, the top American commander in Afghanistan had had enough.

Intelligence reports were painting an increasingly dark picture of the terrorism threat in the tribal areas. But with senior Bush administration officials consumed for much of that year with the spiraling violence in Iraq, the Qaeda threat in Pakistan was not at the top of the White House agenda.

Mr. Bush had declared in a White House news conference that fall that Al Qaeda was “on the run.”

To get Washington’s attention, the commander, Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, ordered military officers, Special Operations forces and C.I.A. operatives to assemble a dossier showing Pakistan’s role in allowing militants to establish a haven.

Behind the general’s order was a broader feeling of outrage within the military — at a terrorist war that had been outsourced to an unreliable ally, and at the grim fact that America’s most deadly enemy had become stronger.

For months, military officers inside a walled-off compound at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, where a branch of the military’s classified Joint Special Operations Command is based, had grown increasingly frustrated at what they saw as missed opportunities in the tribal areas.

American commanders had been pressing for much of 2006 to get approval from Mr. Rumsfeld for an operation to capture Sheik Saiid al-Masri, a top Qaeda operator and paymaster whom American intelligence had been tracking in the Pakistani mountains.

Mr. Rumsfeld and his staff were reluctant to approve the mission, worried about possible American military casualties and a popular backlash in Pakistan.

Finally, in November 2006, Mr. Rumsfeld approved a plan for Navy Seal and Army Delta Force commandos to move into Pakistan and capture Mr. Masri. But the operation was put on hold days later, after Mr. Rumsfeld was pushed out of the Pentagon, a casualty of the Democratic sweep of the 2006 election.

When General Eikenberry presented his dossier to several members of Mr. Bush’s cabinet, some inside the State Department and the C.I.A. dismissed the briefing as exaggerated and simplistic. But the White House took note of his warnings, and decided to send Vice President Dick Cheney to Islamabad in March 2007, along with Stephen R. Kappes, the deputy C.I.A. director, to register American concern.

That visit was the beginning of a more aggressive effort by the administration to pressure Pakistan’s government into stepping up its fight. The decision last year to draw up the Pentagon order authorizing for a Special Operations campaign in the tribal areas was part of that effort.

But the fact that the order remains unsigned reflects the infighting that persists. Administration lawyers and State Department officials are concerned about any new authorities that would allow military missions to be launched without the approval of the American ambassador in Islamabad. With Qaeda operatives now described in intelligence reports as deeply entrenched in the tribal areas and immersed in the civilian population, there is also a view among some military and C.I.A. officials that the opportunity for decisive American action against the militants may have been lost.

Pakistani military officials, meanwhile, express growing frustration with the American pressure, and point out that Pakistan has lost more than 1,000 members of its security forces in the tribal areas since 2001, nearly double the number of Americans killed in Afghanistan.

Some architects of America’s efforts in Pakistan defend the Bush administration’s record in the tribal areas, and vigorously deny that Washington took its eye off the terrorist threat as it focused on Iraq policy. Some also question whether Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri, Al Qaeda’s top two leaders, are really still able to orchestrate large-scale attacks.

“I do wonder if it’s in fact the case that Al Qaeda has really reconstituted itself to a pre-9/11 capability, and in fact I would say I seriously doubt that,” said Mr. Crocker, the American ambassador to Pakistan between 2004 and 2006 and currently the ambassador to Iraq.

“Their top-level leadership is still out there, but they’re not communicating and they’re not moving around. I think they’re symbolic more than operationally effective,” Mr. Crocker said.

But while Mr. Bush vowed early on that Mr. bin Laden would be captured “dead or alive,” the moment in late 2001 when Mr. bin Laden and his followers escaped at Tora Bora was almost certainly the last time the Qaeda leader was in American sights, current and former intelligence officials say. Leading terrorism experts have warned that it is only a matter of time before a major terrorist attack planned in the mountains of Pakistan is carried out on American soil.

“The United States faces a threat from Al Qaeda today that is comparable to what it faced on Sept. 11, 2001,” said Seth Jones, a Pentagon consultant and a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation.

“The base of operations has moved only a short distance, roughly the difference from New York to Philadelphia.”"
150,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban," The mountain of white marble shines with such brilliance in the sun it looks like snow. For four years, the quarry beneath it lay dormant, its riches captive to tribal squabbles and government ineptitude in this corner of Pakistan’s tribal areas.

But in April, the Taliban appeared and imposed a firm hand. They settled the feud between the tribes, demanded a fat fee up front and a tax on every truck that ferried the treasure from the quarry. Since then, Mir Zaman, a contractor from the Masaud subtribe, which was picked by the Taliban to run the quarry, has watched contentedly as his trucks roll out of the quarry with colossal boulders bound for refining in nearby towns.

“With the Taliban it is not a question of a request to us, but a question of force,” said Mr. Zaman, a bearded, middle-aged tribal leader who seemed philosophical about the reality of Taliban authority here. At least the quarry was now operating, he said.

The takeover of the Ziarat marble quarry, a coveted national asset, is one of the boldest examples of how the Taliban have made Pakistan’s tribal areas far more than a base for training camps or a launching pad for sending fighters into Afghanistan.

A rare, unescorted visit to the region this month, during which the Taliban detained for two days a freelance reporter and a photographer working for The New York Times, revealed how the Taliban were taking over territory, using the income they exact to strengthen their hold and turn themselves into a self-sustaining fighting force. The quarry alone has already brought the Taliban tens of thousands of dollars, Mr. Zaman said.

The seizure of the quarry is a measure of how in recent months, as the Pakistani military has pulled back under a series of peace deals, the Pakistani Taliban have extended their reach through more of the rugged territory in northern Pakistan known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or FATA.

Today the Taliban not only settle disputes in their consolidated domain but they also levy taxes, smuggle drugs and other contraband, and impose their own brand of rough justice, complete with courts and prisons.

From the security of this border region, they deploy their fighters and suicide bombers in two directions: against NATO and American forces over the border in southern Afghanistan, and against Pakistani forces — police, army and intelligence officials — in major Pakistani cities.

The quarry operation here in the Mohmand tribal district, strategically situated between the city of Peshawar and the Afghan border, is a new effort by the Taliban to harness the abundant natural resources of a region where there are plenty of other mining operations for coal, gold, copper and chromate.

Of all the minerals in the tribal areas, the marble from Ziarat is one of the most highly prized for use in expensive floors and walls in Pakistan, and in limited quantities abroad.

A government body, the FATA Development Authority, failed over the last several years to mediate a dispute between the Masaud and Gurbaz subtribes over how the mining rights to the marble should be allocated, according to Pakistani government officials familiar with the quarry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the effort’s failure.

A new government mining corporation, Pakistan Stone Development Company, offered last year to invest in modern mining machinery, but even with the lure of added value, the development authority could not sort out the feud.

The arguments were fierce because the tribes knew that the Ziarat marble was of particularly fine texture and purity, comparable to Italian Carrara marble, according to an assessment done for the FATA Development Authority.

The Taliban came eager for a share of the business. Their reputation for brutality and the weakness of the local government authorities allowed the Taliban to settle the dispute in short order.

The Taliban decided that one mountain in the Ziarat area belonged to the Masaud division of the main Safi tribe, and said that the Gurbaz subtribe would be rewarded with another mountain, Mr. Zaman, the contractor, said.

The mountain assigned to the Masauds was divided into 30 portions, he said, and each of six villages in the area was assigned five of the 30 portions. Mr. Zaman said the Taliban demanded about $1,500 commission upfront for each portions, giving the insurgents a quick $45,000.

The Taliban also demanded a tax of about $7 on each truckload of marble, he said. With a constant flow of trucks out of the quarry, the Taliban are now collecting up to $500 a day, Mr. Zaman said.

A senior Pakistani official and a Pakistani businessman who works in the marble industry, neither of whom wanted to be identified for fear of retaliation from the Taliban, confirmed the account.

Today the quarry runs as a relatively rudimentary affair using dynamite, which harms the marble and renders production extremely inefficient. Antiquated trucks grind their way up the steep, tiered roadways carved in the mountainside to ferry the rock away. But the quarry’s reopening has given something to everyone.

The local tribes are profiting along with the Taliban. Once the trucks reach the processing plants, the government, too, collects a hefty tax, nearly double that of the Taliban, Mr. Zaman said, though there was no way to verify the claim. The Taliban appeared to have no problem with the government taking a share, he said.

So far, he said, the Taliban were overseeing the operation with a light hand: a single armed Taliban fighter sat at a checkpoint not far from Mr. Zaman’s hut to ensure that the tax was paid.

The Taliban are today a loose organization of mostly ethnic Pashtuns divided in two wings, one on each side of the border. Their leader in Mohmand goes by the name Abdul Wali, a guerrilla fighter in his 30s who rose to prominence last year when his group occupied a famous shrine in the village of Ghazi Abad in Mohmand.

He is affiliated with the overall leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, a powerful ally of Al Qaeda who keeps his base in South Waziristan, another part of the tribal areas.

Working with Al Qaeda, the Taliban have steadily tightened their grip over much of the tribal areas in the last several years by cowing or killing hundreds of local tribal chiefs who were the area’s traditional authorities.

In Mohmand, the Taliban have speedily consolidated control in the last year. They have filled a vacuum left by a vacillating government, unable and unwilling to assert its authority, said Munir Orekzei, a member of Parliament from Kurram, southwest of Mohmand, one of the seven districts, or agencies, in the tribal areas.

“In every agency the most powerful man is the Taliban,” Mr. Orekzei said. “Because if someone says, ‘I’m in favor of the government,’ he will be killed.”

At the same time, people in the tribal areas believe some branches of the Pakistani government are encouraging the Taliban in their route to power, he said.

Mr. Orekzei said he recently attended a meeting with Rehman Malik, the Pakistani interior minister, and tribal leaders in Peshawar, capital of the nearby North-West Frontier Province.

“Rehman Malik asked why the people in the tribal areas were not figting back against the Taliban,” Mr. Orekzei said. “I told him the people believe the government is behind the Taliban. I said, you tell the public what you are doing, and if they believe the government is not behind the Taliban, they will fight.”

The Taliban’s authority had become so firm in the last two months, it was too dangerous for legislators from the tribal areas to return to their constituencies, Mr. Orekzei said.

Only the capital of Mohmand, the small town of Ghalanai, remains unequivocally in government hands. There, the political agent, the representative of the governor of North-West Frontier Province, keeps a house and offices. But his power barely extends beyond the town’s limits, and he is unable to offer government services to ease the region’s poverty, local people say.

Next door to his compound, a public hospital remains underused because doctors, put off by poor salaries and insecurity, refuse to work there. Health conditions are appalling.

The weakness of the government has left people helpless before the Taliban threat, Mr. Orekzei and other local officials said. Most families had given a man to the Taliban cause, often as a measure of protection against the militants.

The territory has become a magnet for other militants from farther afield as well. More and more of them are coming from abroad, American officials say. But Taliban fighters encountered in Mohmand said they had come from all over Pakistan, revealing the Taliban’s reach into the heart of the country.

Some Taliban fighters said that they had come for the summer from cities like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where they run food stalls or work in hotels, and that they would return home at the start of winter when freezing weather envelops the mountains.

The government security force, a paramilitary group called the Frontier Corps, which serves under the command of the Pakistani Army, does little to challenge the Taliban in the tribal areas, despite occasional skirmishes. On the road north of Ghalanai, there were no Frontier Corps patrols, and 25 miles from Ghalanai the Taliban were in firm control

With the government so weak, the Taliban are accepted as the ruling power in many places in the tribal areas, local officials say. They wield an unflinching hand, to the point of conducting public executions, against the lawlessness that prevails in the region.

In Mohmand, they have imposed extra restrictions on women in the already conservative society, forbidding them to venture into fields and ordering their heads shaved if they flout the edict, according to the handful of legislators who represent the tribal areas in Parliament.

In a place called Chinarai, a two-hour drive from the Afghan border, the Taliban maintain a prison, where the reporter and photographer were held. On a recent day, there were about a dozen people in the compound, all of them manacled and kept in dark small rooms.

In a sign that the internal workings of the Taliban were not entirely smooth, several of the detainees were Taliban, and one of the prisoners was a relative of top Taliban commanders.

Life for the prisoners was spare at best. They were denied cellphones, the most valued possession among the Taliban. Prison food consisted of poorly cooked rice and vegetables. Soap appeared to be used only for body washing, not for cleaning of cooking pots and utensils

Taliban officials reviewing the prisoners’ cases spent much time debating how they should be punished under the Shariah, or Islamic law, imposed by the Taliban. One of the prisoners was suspected of working with the Afghan Army; another was accused of tearing down a Taliban notice.

One man accused of kidnapping was taken out of the prison and beaten into confessing.

Recently, Mohmand has become a center of kidnapping for ransom, a new activity that appears to be another important source of revenue for the Taliban. But the Ziarat quarry will be far more profitable, many people here say.

Even in its current rough condition, the quarry is such a good deal for the Taliban that one tribesman, known as Bahadar, who works there, predicted, “If this continues for two more years, they will take on America itself.”"
151,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"American intelligence agencies have concluded that members of Pakistan’s powerful spy service helped plan the deadly July 7 bombing of India’s embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, according to United States government officials.

The conclusion was based on intercepted communications between Pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack, the officials said, providing the clearest evidence to date that Pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining American efforts to combat militants in the region.

The American officials also said there was new information showing that members of the Pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the American campaign against them, in some cases allowing militants to avoid American missile strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas.

Concerns about the role played by Pakistani intelligence not only has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan, a longtime ally, but also has fanned tensions between Pakistan and its archrival, India. Within days of the bombings, Indian officials accused the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, of helping to orchestrate the attack in Kabul, which killed 54, including an Indian defense attaché.

This week, Pakistani troops clashed with Indian forces in the contested region of Kashmir, threatening to fray an uneasy cease-fire that has held since November 2003.

The New York Times reported this week that a top Central Intelligence Agency official traveled to Pakistan this month to confront senior Pakistani officials with information about support provided by members of the ISI to militant groups. It had not been known that American intelligence agencies concluded that elements of Pakistani intelligence provided direct support for the attack in Kabul.

American officials said that the communications were intercepted before the July 7 bombing, and that the C.I.A. emissary, Stephen R. Kappes, the agency’s deputy director, had been ordered to Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital, even before the attack. The intercepts were not detailed enough to warn of any specific attack.

The government officials were guarded in describing the new evidence and would not say specifically what kind of assistance the ISI officers provided to the militants. They said that the ISI officers had not been renegades, indicating that their actions might have been authorized by superiors.

“It confirmed some suspicions that I think were widely held,” one State Department official with knowledge of Afghanistan issues said of the intercepted communications. “It was sort of this ‘aha’ moment. There was a sense that there was finally direct proof.”

The information linking the ISI to the bombing of the Indian Embassy was described in interviews by several American officials with knowledge of the intelligence. Some of the officials expressed anger that elements of Pakistan’s government seemed to be directly aiding violence in Afghanistan that had included attacks on American troops.

Some American officials have begun to suggest that Pakistan is no longer a fully reliable American partner and to advocate some unilateral American action against militants based in the tribal areas.

The ISI has long maintained ties to militant groups in the tribal areas, in part to court allies it can use to contain Afghanistan’s power. In recent years, Pakistan’s government has also been concerned about India’s growing influence inside Afghanistan, including New Delhi’s close ties to the government of Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president.

American officials say they believe that the embassy attack was probably carried out by members of a network led by Maulavi Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose alliance with Al Qaeda and its affiliates has allowed the terrorist network to rebuild in the tribal areas.

American and Pakistani officials have now acknowledged that President Bush on Monday confronted Pakistan’s prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, about the divided loyalties of the ISI.

Pakistan’s defense minister, Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar, told a Pakistani television network on Wednesday that Mr. Bush asked senior Pakistani officials this week, “ ‘Who is in control of ISI?’ ” and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by Western intelligence services.

Pakistan’s new civilian government is wrestling with these very issues, and there is concern in Washington that the civilian leaders will be unable to end a longstanding relationship between members of the ISI and militants associated with Al Qaeda.

Spokesmen for the White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment for this article. Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, did not return a call seeking comment.

Further underscoring the tension between Pakistan and its Western allies, Britain’s senior military officer said in Washington on Thursday that an American and British program to help train Pakistan’s Frontier Corps in the tribal areas had been delayed while Pakistan’s military and civilian officials sorted out details about the program’s goals.

Britain and the United States had each offered to send about two dozen military trainers to Pakistan later this summer to train Pakistani Army officers who in turn would instruct the Frontier Corps paramilitary forces.

But the British officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, said the program had been temporarily delayed. “We don’t yet have a firm start date,” he told a small group of reporters. “We’re ready to go.”

The bombing of the Indian Embassy helped to set off a new deterioration in relations between India and Pakistan.

This week, Indian and Pakistani soldiers fired at each other across the Kashmir frontier for more than 12 hours overnight Monday, in what the Indian Army called the most serious violation of a five-year-old cease-fire agreement. The nightlong battle came after one Indian soldier and four Pakistanis were killed along the border between sections of Kashmir that are controlled by India and by Pakistan.

Indian officials say they are equally worried about what is happening on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border because they say the insurgents who are facing off with India in Kashmir and those who target Afghanistan are related and can keep both borders burning at the same time.

India and Afghanistan share close political, cultural and economic ties, and India maintains an active intelligence network in Afghanistan, all of which has drawn suspicion from Pakistani officials.

When asked Thursday about whether the ISI and Pakistani military remained loyal to the country’s civilian government, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sidestepped the question. “That’s probably something the government of Pakistan ought to speak to,” Admiral Mullen told reporters at the Pentagon.

Jalaluddin Haqqani, the militia commander, battled Soviet troops during the 1980s and has had a long and complicated relationship with the C.I.A. He was among a group of fighters who received arms and millions of dollars from the C.I.A. during that period, but his allegiance with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda during the following decade led the United States to sever the relationship.

Mr. Haqqani and his sons now run a network that Western intelligence services say they believe is responsible for a campaign of violence throughout Afghanistan, including the Indian Embassy bombing and an attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul earlier this year."
152,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"To the villagers here, there is no doubt what happened in an American airstrike on Aug. 22: more than 90 civilians, the majority of them women and children, were killed.

The Afghan government, human rights and intelligence officials, independent witnesses and a United Nations investigation back up their account, pointing to dozens of freshly dug graves, lists of the dead, and cellphone videos and other images showing bodies of women and children laid out in the village mosque.

Cellphone images seen by this reporter show at least 11 dead children, some apparently with blast and concussion injuries, among some 30 to 40 bodies laid out in the village mosque. Ten days after the airstrikes, villagers dug up the last victim from the rubble, a baby just a few months old. Their shock and grief is still palpable.

For two weeks, the United States military has insisted that only 5 to 7 civilians, and 30 to 35 militants, were killed in what it says was a successful operation against the Taliban: a Special Operations ground mission backed up by American air support. But on Sunday, Gen. David D. McKiernan, the senior American commander in Afghanistan, requested that a general be sent from Central Command to review the American military investigation in light of “emerging evidence.”

“The people of Afghanistan have our commitment to get to the truth,” he said in a statement.

The military investigation drew on what military officials called convincing technical evidence documenting a far smaller number of graves than the villagers had reported, as well as a thorough sweep of this small western hamlet, a building-by-building search a few hours after the airstrikes, and a return visit on Aug. 26, which villagers insist never occurred.

The repercussions of the airstrikes have consumed both the Afghan government and the American military, wearing the patience of Afghans at all levels after repeated cases of civilian casualties over the last six years and threatening to erode their tolerance for the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan. President Hamid Karzai visited Azizabad on Thursday to pay his respects to the mourners, condemning the strikes, and vowing to arrest an Afghan he says misled American forces with false intelligence.

President Bush expressed his regrets and sympathy in a call to Mr. Karzai on Wednesday. And General McKiernan has issued several statements voicing sorrow for civilian casualties.

The Afghan government is demanding changes in the accords defining the United States military engagement in Afghanistan, in particular ending American military raids on villages and halting the detention of Afghan citizens.

“People are sick of hearing there is another case of civilian casualties,” one presidential aide said.

Differing Accounts
The accounts of the airstrike’s aftermath given by Afghans and Americans could not be further apart.

A visitor to the village and to three graveyards within its limits on Aug. 31 counted 42 freshly dug graves. Thirteen of the graves were so small they could hold only children; another 13 were marked with stones in the way that Afghans identify women’s graves.

Villagers questioned separately identified relatives in the graves; their names matched the accounts given by elders of the village of those who died in each of eight bomb-damaged houses and where they were buried. They were quite specific about who was killed in the airstrikes and did not count those who died for other reasons; one of the fresh graves, they said, belonged to a man who was killed when villagers demonstrated against the Afghan Army on Aug. 23.

At the battle scene, shell craters dotted the courtyards and shrapnel had gouged holes in the walls. Rooms had collapsed and mud bricks and torn clothing lay in uneven mounds where people had been digging. In two places blood was splattered on a ceiling and a wall. An old woman pushed forward with a cauldron full of jagged metal bomb fragments, and a youth presented cellphone video he said was shot on the day of the bombing; there was no time stamp.

The smell of bodies lingered in one compound, causing villagers to start digging with spades. They found the body of a baby, caked in dust, in the corner of a bombed-out room.

Cellphone images that a villager said that he shot, and seen by this reporter, showed two lines of about 20 bodies each laid out in the mosque, with the sounds of loud sobbing and villagers’ cries in the background.

An Afghan doctor who runs a clinic in a nearby village said he counted 50 to 60 bodies of civilians, most of them women and children and some of them his own patients, laid out in the village mosque on the day of the strike. The doctor, who works for a reputable nongovernmental organization here, at first gave his name but then asked that it be withheld because he feared retribution from Afghans feeding intelligence to the Americans.

The United States military, in a series of statements about the operation, has accused the villagers of spreading Taliban propaganda. Speaking on condition that their names not be used, some military officials have suggested that the villagers fabricated such evidence as grave sites — and, by implication, that other investigators had been duped. But many villagers have connections to the Afghan police, NATO or the Americans through reconstruction projects, and they say they oppose the Taliban.

The district chief of Shindand, Lal Muhammad Umarzai, 45, said he personally counted 76 bodies that day, and he believed that more bodies were unearthed over the next two days, bringing the total to more than 90. Mr. Umarzai has been praised for bringing security to the district in the three months since his appointment and is on good terms with American and NATO forces in the region.

American military investigators said that they had interviewed him and that he had told them that he had no access to the village. But Mr. Umarzai said Taliban supporters came into the village in midmorning after the airstrikes, forcing him and the police to leave the village, but that later he was able to return and attend the burials.

The United Nations issued a statement pointing to evidence it considered conclusive that about 90 civilians were killed, some 75 of them women and children. Villagers and relatives said that the bodies were scattered in different locations; many of the victims were visiting Azizabad for a family memorial ceremony, and their relatives took their bodies back to their home villages for burial. This reporter did not visit the other villages but was given a detailed list of names and places where the remaining victims were buried.

Accounts from survivors, including three people wounded in the bombing, described repeated strikes on houses where dozens of children were sleeping, grandparents and uncles and aunts huddled inside with them. Most of the village families were asleep when the shooting broke out, some sleeping out under mosquito nets in the yards of their houses, some inside the small domed rooms of their houses, lying close together on the floor, with up to 10 or 20 people in a room.

“I woke up when I heard shooting,” Zainab, a 26-year-old woman who doctors said was wounded in the attack, said in an interview in the Herat city hospital. “The shooting was very close to our house. We just stayed where we were because it was dangerous to go out. When the bombardment started there was smoke everywhere and we lay down to protect ourselves.”

Yakhakhan, 51, one of several men in the village working for a private security firm, and who uses just one name, said he heard shooting and was just coming out of his house when he saw his neighbor’s sons running.

“They were killed right here; they were 10 and 7 years old,” he said. In the compound next to his, he said, four entire families, including those of his two brothers, were killed. “They bombard us, they hate us, they kill us,” he said of the Americans. “God will punish them.”

A policeman, Abdul Hakim, whose four children were killed and whose wife was paralyzed, said she had told him how an Afghan informer accompanying the American Special Operations forces had entered the compound after the bombardment and shot dead her brother, Reza Khan; her father; and an uncle as they were trying to help her. She said she had heard her father plead for help and ask the Afghan: “Are you a Muslim? Why are you doing this to us?” Then she heard shots, and her father did not speak after that, he said.

A United States military spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Rumi Nielson-Green, said in an e-mail message that she was unaware of such an allegation, and that the American military did not have Afghan civilian informers accompanying its forces during the mission. Soldiers treated wounded people at the scene, which indicated that the Laws of Armed Conflict were followed, she said.

No Taliban, Villagers Say
While the American forces reported they had come under fire upon entering the village, it is not clear from whom. The villagers and the relatives of some of the people killed in the raid insisted that none of them were Taliban and that there were no Taliban present in the village. Eight of the men killed were security guards supplied by Reza Khan to a private American security company and did possess weapons, said Gul Ahmed Khan, Reza Khan’s brother. Two other security guards and three members of the local Afghan police were detained by United States forces during the raid. Four of them were released a week later.

The Khan brothers are from the most prominent family in the village and were hosting the memorial ceremony for their brother, Taimoor Shah, who was killed in a business dispute a year ago. They had cards issued by an American Special Forces officer that designated each of them as a “coordinator for the U.S.S.F.” Another brother, Haji Abdul Rashid, blamed a business rival for falsely telling the Americans that their family supported the Taliban.

American military officials in Afghanistan and Washington have stood by their much lower body count. Capt. Christian Patterson, an American military spokesman at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul, said that an investigating officer, a Special Forces major, visited the village after the airstrikes. Guided by aerial photographs, he visited six burial sites within a six-mile range of the attack; only one had any freshly dug graves, about 18 to 20 in total, Captain Patterson said. The 12-page investigative report does not indicate whether they were the graves of children or women. The officer did not interview villagers, he said.

Mr. Khan, whose house is just yards from the main graveyard, which contains 24 fresh graves, said no members of the American military had entered the village since Aug. 22. Villagers living around the graveyards would have seen them, he said.

The American military also said that it had found only two wounded people, a woman and a child, at the scene, and that in a survey of clinics, doctors and hospitals of the area it had found no other wounded.

U.S. Defends Operation
In a series of statements about the operation, the American military has said that extremists who entered the village after the bombardment encouraged villagers to change their story and inflate the number of dead. Yet the Afghan government and the United Nation have stood by the victims’ families and their accounts, not least because many of the families work for the Afghan government or reconstruction projects. The villagers say they oppose the Taliban and would not let them in the village.

“You can see our I.D. cards,” said a police officer, Muhammad Alam, 35, who was accused by the Americans of being a Taliban supporter and was detained for a week after the airstrikes, then released. “If the Taliban caught me, they would slaughter me.”

Two families in the village have lost men serving in the police during recent Taliban attacks. Reza Khan, whose house was the main target of the Special Operations Forces operation, and who was shot dead in the episode, was a wealthy businessman with construction and security contracts with the nearby American base at Shindand airport, and with a cellphone business in the town of Herat. A recent photo of him shows a clean-shaven, slightly portly man in a suit and tie — far from the typical look of a Taliban militant.

His brother, Haji Rashid, said the American forces “should question the people who gave them the wrong information.”

“We want them brought to trial and punished for what they have done,” he added.

His claim was supported by the district chief, Mr. Umarzai, who said, “The victims did not fire on the Americans.” He said he suspected that an informer falsely told the American forces that Taliban fighters were in the village and also staged the firefight. The gunmen first fired on the police checkpoint on the edge of the village that night, he said. “When the Americans came, they laid down heavy gunfire and then they left the area. Then the Americans called in airstrikes,” he said.

Villagers also challenged the American military’s claims that it successfully conducted its planned operation against a Taliban commander, Mullah Sadiq, and a group of his men.

A man claiming to be Mullah Sadiq called Radio Liberty several days after the raid and declared that he was alive and well and was never in the village of Azizabad that night. Reporters at the radio station, who asked not to be identified, said they knew his voice well and double checked the recording with residents of Shindand and they were sure the caller was Mullah Sadiq.

American military officials have said that the man who called the radio program was an imposter and that they are confident they killed their target.

A senior American officer who has been briefed on the military investigation’s findings said in an e-mail message: “I will simply say that the soldiers — U.S. and Afghan — reported what they saw and found at each building site as they looked for material, weapons, bodies. I cannot explain why later the numbers are so far apart.”

Members of the Afghan government investigation commission said that the Americans were just covering up the truth. “The Americans are guilty in this incident: it is much better for them to confess the reality rather than hiding the truth,” said Abdul Salam Qazizada, a member of Parliament and the government commission from Herat Province, where the village is located.

Villagers suggested that the soldiers just counted those who died in the open and did not try to dig under the rubble. A local journalist, Reza Shir Mohammadi, said that when he visited the village on the second day after the attack, women and children were still weeping at one collapsed house, saying they still had not found their mother and siblings.

The operation in Azizabad once again raises questions for the military about whether it is worth pursuing members of the Taliban with airstrikes inside a densely populated village where civilian casualties and property damage can be so high. A similar raid in the same district by American Special Forces in April 2007, which killed 57 people, led American and NATO commanders to tighten rules on calling in airstrikes on village houses.

“This is not fair to kill 90 people for one Mullah Sadiq,” said Mr. Umarzai, the district chief. “If they continue like this, they will lose the people’s confidence in the government and the coalition forces.”"
153,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"President Bush secretly approved orders in July that for the first time allow American Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government, according to senior American officials.

The classified orders signal a watershed for the Bush administration after nearly seven years of trying to work with Pakistan to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and after months of high-level stalemate about how to challenge the militants’ increasingly secure base in Pakistan’s tribal areas.

American officials say that they will notify Pakistan when they conduct limited ground attacks like the Special Operations raid last Wednesday in a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border, but that they will not ask for its permission.

“The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable,” said a senior American official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the missions. “We have to be more assertive. Orders have been issued.”

The new orders reflect concern about safe havens for Al Qaeda and the Taliban inside Pakistan, as well as an American view that Pakistan lacks the will and ability to combat militants. They also illustrate lingering distrust of the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies and a belief that some American operations had been compromised once Pakistanis were advised of the details.

The Central Intelligence Agency has for several years fired missiles at militants inside Pakistan from remotely piloted Predator aircraft. But the new orders for the military’s Special Operations forces relax firm restrictions on conducting raids on the soil of an important ally without its permission.

Pakistan’s top army officer said Wednesday that his forces would not tolerate American incursions like the one that took place last week and that the army would defend the country’s sovereignty “at all costs.”

It is unclear precisely what legal authorities the United States has invoked to conduct even limited ground raids in a friendly country. A second senior American official said that the Pakistani government had privately assented to the general concept of limited ground assaults by Special Operations forces against significant militant targets, but that it did not approve each mission

The official did not say which members of the government gave their approval.

Any new ground operations in Pakistan raise the prospect of American forces being killed or captured in the restive tribal areas — and a propaganda coup for Al Qaeda. Last week’s raid also presents a major test for Pakistan’s new president, Asif Ali Zardari, who supports more aggressive action by his army against the militants but cannot risk being viewed as an American lap dog, as was his predecessor, Pervez Musharraf.

The new orders were issued after months of debate inside the Bush administration about whether to authorize a ground campaign inside Pakistan. The debate, first reported by The New York Times in late June, at times pitted some officials at the State Department against parts of the Pentagon that advocated aggressive action against Qaeda and Taliban targets inside the tribal areas.

Details about last week’s commando operation have emerged that indicate the mission was more intrusive than had previously been known

According to two American officials briefed on the raid, it involved more than two dozen members of the Navy Seals who spent several hours on the ground and killed about two dozen suspected Qaeda fighters in what now appeared to have been a planned attack against militants who had been conducting attacks against an American forward operating base across the border in Afghanistan.

Supported by an AC-130 gunship, the Special Operations forces were whisked away by helicopters after completing the mission.

Although the senior American official who provided the most detailed description of the new presidential order would discuss it only on condition of anonymity, his account was corroborated by three other senior American officials from several government agencies, all of whom made clear that they supported the more aggressive approach.

Pakistan’s government has asserted that last week’s raid achieved little except killing civilians and stoking anti-Americanism in the tribal areas.

“Unilateral action by the American forces does not help the war against terror because it only enrages public opinion,” said Husain Haqqani, Pakistan’s ambassador to Washington, during a speech on Friday. “In this particular incident, nothing was gained by the action of the troops.”

As an alternative to American ground operations, some Pakistani officials have made clear that they prefer the C.I.A.’s Predator aircraft, operating from the skies, as a method of killing Qaeda operatives. The C.I.A. for the most part has coordinated with Pakistan’s government before and after it has launched missiles from the drone. On Monday, a Predator strike in North Waziristan killed several Arab Qaeda operatives.

A new American command structure was put in place this year to better coordinate missions by the C.I.A. and members of the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations Command, made up of the Army’s Delta Force and the Navy Seals

The move was intended to address frustration on the ground about different agencies operating under different marching orders. Under the arrangement, a senior C.I.A. official based at Bagram air base in Afghanistan was put in charge of coordinating C.I.A. and military activities in the border region.

Spokesmen for the White House, the Defense Department and the C.I.A. declined to comment on Wednesday about the new orders. Some senior Congressional officials have received briefings on the new authorities. A spokeswoman for Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Armed Services Committee, declined to comment.

American commanders in Afghanistan have complained bitterly that militants use sanctuaries in Pakistan to attack American troops in Afghanistan.

“I’m not convinced we’re winning it in Afghanistan,” Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. “I am convinced we can.”

Toward that goal, Admiral Mullen said he had ordered a comprehensive military strategy to address the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan

The commando raid last week and an increasing number of recent missile strikes are part of a more aggressive overall American campaign in the border region aimed at intensifying attacks on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the waning months of the Bush administration, with less than two months to go before November elections.

State Department officials, as well as some within the National Security Council, have expressed concern about any Special Operations missions that could be carried out without the approval of the American ambassador in Islamabad.

The months-long delay in approving ground missions created intense frustration inside the military’s Special Operations community, which believed that the Bush administration was holding back as the Qaeda safe haven inside Pakistan became more secure for militants.

The stepped-up campaign inside Pakistan comes at a time when American-Pakistani relations have been fraying, and when anger is increasing within American intelligence agencies about ties between Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, known as the ISI, and militants in the tribal areas.

Analysts at the C.I.A. and other American spy and security agencies believe not only that the bombing of India’s embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, in July by militants was aided by ISI operatives, but also that the highest levels of Pakistan’s security apparatus — including the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani — had knowledge of the plot.

“It’s very difficult to imagine he was not aware,” a senior American official said of General Kayani.

American intelligence agencies have said that senior Pakistani national security officials favor the use of militant groups to preserve Pakistan’s influence in the region, as a hedge against India and Afghanistan.

In fact, some American intelligence analysts believe that ISI operatives did not mind when their role in the July bombing in Kabul became known. “They didn’t cover their tracks very well,” a senior Defense Department official said, “and I think the embassy bombing was the ISI drawing a line in the sand.”"
154,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"The United States military since 2004 has used broad, secret authority to carry out nearly a dozen previously undisclosed attacks against Al Qaeda and other militants in Syria, Pakistan and elsewhere, according to senior American officials.

These military raids, typically carried out by Special Operations forces, were authorized by a classified order that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld signed in the spring of 2004 with the approval of President Bush, the officials said. The secret order gave the military new authority to attack the Qaeda terrorist network anywhere in the world, and a more sweeping mandate to conduct operations in countries not at war with the United States.

In 2006, for example, a Navy Seal team raided a suspected militants’ compound in the Bajaur region of Pakistan, according to a former top official of the Central Intelligence Agency. Officials watched the entire mission — captured by the video camera of a remotely piloted Predator aircraft — in real time in the C.I.A.’s Counterterrorist Center at the agency’s headquarters in Virginia 7,000 miles away.

Some of the military missions have been conducted in close coordination with the C.I.A., according to senior American officials, who said that in others, like the Special Operations raid in Syria on Oct. 26 of this year, the military commandos acted in support of C.I.A.-directed operations.

But as many as a dozen additional operations have been canceled in the past four years, often to the dismay of military commanders, senior military officials said. They said senior administration officials had decided in these cases that the missions were too risky, were too diplomatically explosive or relied on insufficient evidence.

More than a half-dozen officials, including current and former military and intelligence officials as well as senior Bush administration policy makers, described details of the 2004 military order on the condition of anonymity because of its politically delicate nature. Spokesmen for the White House, the Defense Department and the military declined to comment.

Apart from the 2006 raid into Pakistan, the American officials refused to describe in detail what they said had been nearly a dozen previously undisclosed attacks, except to say they had been carried out in Syria, Pakistan and other countries. They made clear that there had been no raids into Iran using that authority, but they suggested that American forces had carried out reconnaissance missions in Iran using other classified directives.

According to a senior administration official, the new authority was spelled out in a classified document called “Al Qaeda Network Exord,” or execute order, that streamlined the approval process for the military to act outside officially declared war zones. Where in the past the Pentagon needed to get approval for missions on a case-by-case basis, which could take days when there were only hours to act, the new order specified a way for Pentagon planners to get the green light for a mission far more quickly, the official said.

It also allowed senior officials to think through how the United States would respond if a mission went badly. “If that helicopter goes down in Syria en route to a target,” a former senior military official said, “the American response would not have to be worked out on the fly.”

The 2004 order was a step in the evolution of how the American government sought to kill or capture Qaeda terrorists around the world. It was issued after the Bush administration had already granted America’s intelligence agencies sweeping power to secretly detain and interrogate terrorism suspects in overseas prisons and to conduct warrantless eavesdropping on telephone and electronic communications.

Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush issued a classified order authorizing the C.I.A. to kill or capture Qaeda militants around the globe. By 2003, American intelligence agencies and the military had developed a much deeper understanding of Al Qaeda’s extensive global network, and Mr. Rumsfeld pressed hard to unleash the military’s vast firepower against militants outside the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.

The 2004 order identifies 15 to 20 countries, including Syria, Pakistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and several other Persian Gulf states, where Qaeda militants were believed to be operating or to have sought sanctuary, a senior administration official said.

Even with the order, each specific mission requires high-level government approval. Targets in Somalia, for instance, need at least the approval of the defense secretary, the administration official said, while targets in a handful of countries, including Pakistan and Syria, require presidential approval.

The Pentagon has exercised its authority frequently, dispatching commandos to countries including Pakistan and Somalia. Details of a few of these strikes have previously been reported.

For example, shortly after Ethiopian troops crossed into Somalia in late 2006 to dislodge an Islamist regime in Mogadishu, the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations Command quietly sent operatives and AC-130 gunships to an airstrip near the Ethiopian town of Dire Dawa. From there, members of a classified unit called Task Force 88 crossed repeatedly into Somalia to hunt senior members of a Qaeda cell believed to be responsible for the 1998 American Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

At the time, American officials said Special Operations troops were operating under a classified directive authorizing the military to kill or capture Qaeda operatives if failure to act quickly would mean the United States had lost a “fleeting opportunity” to neutralize the enemy.

Occasionally, the officials said, Special Operations troops would land in Somalia to assess the strikes’ results. On Jan. 7, 2007, an AC-130 struck an isolated fishing village near the Kenyan border, and within hours, American commandos and Ethiopian troops were examining the rubble to determine whether any Qaeda operatives had been killed.

But even with the new authority, proposed Pentagon missions were sometimes scrubbed because of bad intelligence or bureaucratic entanglements, senior administration officials said.

The details of one of those aborted operations, in early 2005, were reported by The New York Times last June. In that case, an operation to send a team of the Navy Seals and the Army Rangers into Pakistan to capture Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden’s top deputy, was aborted at the last minute.

Mr. Zawahri was believed by intelligence officials to be attending a meeting in Bajaur, in Pakistan’s tribal areas, and the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations Command hastily put together a plan to capture him. There were strong disagreements inside the Pentagon and the C.I.A. about the quality of the intelligence, however, and some in the military expressed concern that the mission was unnecessarily risky.

Porter J. Goss, the C.I.A. director at the time, urged the military to carry out the mission, and some in the C.I.A. even wanted to execute it without informing Ryan C. Crocker, then the American ambassador to Pakistan. Mr. Rumsfeld ultimately refused to authorize the mission.

Former military and intelligence officials said that Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who recently completed his tour as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, had pressed for years to win approval for commando missions into Pakistan. But the missions were frequently rejected because officials in Washington determined that the risks to American troops and the alliance with Pakistan were too great.

Capt. John Kirby, a spokesman for General McChrystal, who is now director of the military’s Joint Staff, declined to comment.

The recent raid into Syria was not the first time that Special Operations forces had operated in that country, according to a senior military official and an outside adviser to the Pentagon.

Since the Iraq war began, the official and the outside adviser said, Special Operations forces have several times made cross-border raids aimed at militants and infrastructure aiding the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq.

The raid in late October, however, was much more noticeable than the previous raids, military officials said, which helps explain why it drew a sharp protest from the Syrian government.

Negotiations to hammer out the 2004 order took place over nearly a year and involved wrangling between the Pentagon and the C.I.A. and the State Department about the military’s proper role around the world, several administration officials said.

American officials said there had been debate over whether to include Iran in the 2004 order, but ultimately Iran was set aside, possibly to be dealt with under a separate authorization.

Senior officials of the State Department and the C.I.A. voiced fears that military commandos would encroach on their turf, conducting operations that historically the C.I.A. had carried out, and running missions without an ambassador’s knowledge or approval.

Mr. Rumsfeld had pushed in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks to expand the mission of Special Operations troops to include intelligence gathering and counterterrorism operations in countries where American commandos had not operated before.

Bush administration officials have shown a determination to operate under an expansive definition of self-defense that provides a legal rationale for strikes on militant targets in sovereign nations without those countries’ consent.

Several officials said the negotiations over the 2004 order resulted in closer coordination among the Pentagon, the State Department and the C.I.A., and set a very high standard for the quality of intelligence necessary to gain approval for an attack.

The 2004 order also provided a foundation for the orders that Mr. Bush approved in July allowing the military to conduct raids into the Pakistani tribal areas, including the Sept. 3 operation by Special Operations forces that killed about 20 militants, American officials said

Administration officials said that Mr. Bush’s approval had paved the way for Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to sign an order — separate from the 2004 order — that specifically directed the military to plan a series of operations, in cooperation with the C.I.A., on the Qaeda network and other militant groups linked to it in Pakistan.

Unlike the 2004 order, in which Special Operations commanders nominated targets for approval by senior government officials, the order in July was more of a top-down approach, directing the military to work with the C.I.A. to find targets in the tribal areas, administration officials said. They said each target still needed to be approved by the group of Mr. Bush’s top national security and foreign policy advisers, called the Principals Committee."
155,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban," The small stone castle, sandbagged and bristling with weapons and American soldiers, rises from a rock spur beside the Landai River. Mountains lean overhead.

Once a hunting lodge for Mohammad Zahir Shah, Afghanistan’s last king, the castle is home for a year for an American cavalry troop, an Afghan infantry company, a Navy corpsman and two American marines. In the deadly contest for Afghanistan’s borderlands, it plays what might seem a singularly unattractive role. The position lies exposed near the bottom of a natural amphitheater deep within territory out of government control.

Insurgents hide in caves surrounding it and in villages nearby, operating unhindered almost to the castle’s concertina wire and lobbing mortar shells toward it at will. The steep slopes facing the walls are littered with shattered boulders and trees blown to splinters by the artillery and airstrikes with which the soldiers have fought back.

The Americans’ mission is to disrupt the Taliban and foreign fighters on supply paths from Pakistan’s tribal areas. Col. John Spiszer, the commanding officer for the larger task force in the region, distilled how the mission often worked. The American presence, he said, is a Taliban magnet, drawing insurgents from more populated areas and enhancing security elsewhere.

First Lt. Daniel Wright, the executive officer of the American cavalry unit — Apache Troop of the Sixth Battalion, Fourth Cavalry — put things in foxhole terms.

“Basically,” he said, “we’re the bullet sponge.”

That analogy is a measure of the profound and enduring difficulties in the war in Afghanistan, which this year became more deadly for Americans than the Iraq conflict. President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to refocus the Pentagon on winning this war, now in its eighth year.

In roughly four months, Apache Troop has taken fire on at least 70 days. The attacks have come by rocket, mortar, machine gun and rifle fire. The troop’s patrols have been ambushed. Its observation posts have been hit by rocket fire.

On one day alone, the outpost was attacked four times.

 

The fighting is so frequent, and the terrain so rugged and heavily populated by insurgent spotters, that the outpost’s patrols dare not venture far.

On Saturday, insurgents fired on Apache Troop for an hour in the morning with a mix of mortar shells, rockets and large-caliber sniper fire. The soldiers fought back until they thought the attack had ended. Then the Taliban opened fire again.

Fighting broke out again at 1 p.m. During the exchange, a mortar round landed at the base of the castle’s southern wall and exploded with a thunderous crack, shaking the compound. About 15 long seconds later, a radio operator called to the other bunkers over the two-way radios. “Everyone’s O.K.,” he said.

Shortly before 5 p.m., the insurgents struck again with rocket and automatic rifle fire aimed at engineers who were moving equipment near an observation post. After a firefight that lasted about five minutes, they slipped away in the fading light.

Afghan Effort Undercut
The unvarnished consensus among soldiers here, many of them veterans of the war in Iraq, is that the Pentagon’s efforts in Iraq undermined its efforts in Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda plotted attacks on the United States. The military has been reviewing its Afghan strategy.

Before Election Day more soldiers had been ordered to Afghanistan to rejoin the fight. They are due to arrive soon. (The Army forbids disclosing deployment dates or troop numbers at outposts.)

For now, the soldiers of Apache Troop absorb and repel attack after attack. Sgt. Michael S. Ayres, a squad leader, summarized the practical mentality: standing watch behind heavy machine guns, the soldiers are waiting for reinforcements so they can change the nature of their fight.

“We need all the help we can get out here, so we can push out patrols and get out of the defensive,” he said.

Many also find they are managing their frustration at taking harassment fire from the heights overhead and ambushes from opposite ridges.

Because of the severity of the terrain, and the insurgents’ quickness, there is little ability to fight at close range.

“I’m just so tired of seeing muzzle flashes at 800 yards,” said Gunnery Sgt. Daniel McKernan, who trains and advises the Afghan Army here. “This is like Vietnam. Hike around these mountains and you never see them. But they are always out there. And they always attack you.”

While the soldiers wait, their days are filled by the routines of life in a hostile land. Soldiers stand guard around the clock. Each soldier is allowed to sleep in brief shifts, in crowded bunkrooms shared with bed bugs, flies and mice, while other soldiers man the guns.

By day the soldiers burn garbage and the stinking waste accumulated in latrine barrels. In the summer, many of their mattresses were so badly infested with parasites that they burned them, too.

At night the soldiers douse the smoldering pile so its red glow does not guide the Taliban’s aim.

The soldiers lift weights when they can, although incoming mortar shells have had an uncanny attraction for the weight room and the plywood hut that serves as the latrine.

Some soldiers exercise or visit the latrines only in darkness, when attacks are less common.

“Did you get the word?” a sergeant asked a reporter last month as they took cover and a mortar round exploded about 100 feet away, beside the latrine. “Stay out of there by day.”

Showers are an occasional luxury, when water is available. The tank above the shower heads is fed by a pipe carrying spring water from the mountains. The Taliban often disconnect the pipe near its source. Sometimes livestock step on it and break it, too. (Early on Monday, as this story went to print, the Taliban struck with mortars again. The second shell destroyed the showers.)

There is no Internet except at the troop’s command center, and no television. Limited electricity means the soldiers have far fewer comforts than veterans recall from other tours.

“We don’t have the same amenities they had in previous deployments, say to Iraq,” said Sgt. First Class Shawn Tiarks, platoon sergeant for the troop’s second platoon. “A lot of soldiers thought it was going to be identical to that, and it was a little shocking to find the environment we have.”

Resupply and troop rotation can come solely by helicopters, because the twisting dirt road to the castle has been made impassable for military vehicles by the destruction of two bridges — one that collapsed and another that was blown up by the Taliban. Barring an emergency, helicopters risk flying here only at night.

The limits on travel have meant shortages.

Several areas of the outpost remain dangerous because the troop lacks the supplies to harden the castle more fully.

“We don’t get enough sandbags, and at the present moment, we are plumb out,” Sergeant Tiarks said.

Foothold and Statement
Colonel Spiszer, the regional commander, said in an e-mail message that despite the difficulties, keeping the Taliban focused on the outpost had advantages, because the task force could mass firepower and fight with less risk to civilians than in other places.

“Due to the remoteness of the area we are better able to use our advantages in fires — mortars, artillery, attack helicopters and close air support — to fight and usually defeat the enemy pretty decisively,” he wrote.

The outpost, he suggested, was both a foothold in the region and a statement. Withdrawing from it, he said, would allow the Taliban to claim it had driven the Americans back, as they did when the task force closed another remote outpost earlier this year.

On Thursday, residents of Kamu, a nearby village, warned the outpost that insurgents were planning a larger assault. Twenty enemy fighters had been seen congregating in one village, one man said, and 40 in another.

The insurgents had at least six mortar tubes, he said, and were being helped by the Pakistani intelligence service, which is a common and unverifiable claim here. Their mortars were being moved into place by donkey, he added. (The man’s name was withheld to protect him from being killed as an American collaborator.)

The soldiers discussed the information. Six mortar tubes would be enough to pound the outpost, they said.

On several recent days, a single Taliban mortar tube, firing multiple rounds, had driven the soldiers for cover and had to be countered with mortar shells, artillery or low-flying fighter planes before going silent. The firing would resume the next day.

During one attack, soldiers took shelter in the castle, waiting to see where each incoming round would strike. “How’s a guy supposed to quit smoking?” said Staff Sgt. Josiah Coderellis, a scout, between explosions.

As intense as the fighting has been, the troop — and when this subject is raised they almost invariably tap on anything made of wood — has suffered only one serious injury since arriving: Pvt. First Class Evan Oshel, who was struck by shrapnel in August. He is recovering in Fort Hood, Tex.

“It’s hard to believe there’s only one,” said Capt. Frank Hooker, the troop commander, shaking his head.

In October, the attacks became more dangerous. On one day, a rocket-propelled grenade severed the right arm and part of the right foot of a local teenager working in the laundry. Several days later, a mortar round killed an Afghan guard and injured an Afghan cook, who remained in critical condition last week.

There were also close calls. One mortar round exploded by the open-air weight room, nearly killing a marine captain and a photographer for The New York Times, who crouched together against a stone wall about 15 feet away. The wall absorbed the shrapnel. The captain suffered a concussion.

Another round struck directly in front of a machine gun bunker, where soldiers huddled as it screamed down and exploded. Pvt. First Class William Solorzano described the unforgettable sound. “It’s a bad noise,” he said.

Then he reconsidered. “Actually, it’s a beautiful noise, if you get to hear it,” he said. “Because if you don’t hear it, that’s because you’re dead.”

Keeping Foe Off Balance
In an effort to keep the Taliban off balance, the troop and the Afghan Army conduct occasional patrols, varying the routine so insurgents will not anticipate them.

On one recent evening, a squad of Afghan soldiers and three American advisers left the castle and slipped out just before dusk. They picked their way up a rocky trail, wondering whether they had been seen.

The answer came quickly. A rocket-propelled grenade hissed through the air from an opposite ridge, passed the patrol and flew by the castle. It exploded in the riverbed with an ear-splitting crack.

A brief firefight ensued. Along the castle’s walls, the soldiers peered through their rifle scopes. A few shouted insults. The troop’s 120-millimeter mortar crew began shelling the Taliban firing position, a cave entrance on a ridge about 1,000 yards away.

First they fired explosive rounds, then white phosphorous, which set the vegetation by the cave on fire, marking it for an F-15 fighter jet that dropped a 500-pound guided bomb.

The detonation shook the valley. Quiet settled on the outpost. On the castle’s roof, voices floated in the darkness, and soldiers’ faces were briefly illuminated when they puffed on cigarettes. They wondered whether the insurgents had been killed.

“I don’t know if he’s dead,” Sergeant Coderellis said. “But he ain’t happy.”

“I think he’s dead,” Sergeant Tiarks said.

“At least his ears are ringing,” a third soldier said.

“They aren’t ringing,” Sergeant Coderellis said. “They’re bleeding.”

Like any other feeling, bravado here comes and goes. At other moments, servicemen were contemplative. They were waiting, they said, for many things.

They were waiting for the Afghan Army to become competent, so it could secure the country with less American help; this, the soldiers said, will take years.

They were waiting for a new strategy and for more American units to arrive, to allow soldiers in forward outposts to perform more ambitious operations; this will take at least several weeks, and probably longer.

Some were waiting for leave, and a chance to see home.

Meanwhile, as the Taliban set the pace, the soldiers waited to see what each hour would bring. Late on one recent night, Petty Officer Third Class Ramon Gavan arranged his rifle, helmet and flak jacket beside his bed, putting it all at arm’s reach.

“Living the dream,” he said, repeating a one-liner often heard here.

“This is where you realize not to take every breath for granted,” he said, and he swung his legs onto his bed, pulled a poncho liner across his face, and fell asleep. The next day, he was back on patrol."
156,NYT,Staff,2009,Pakistan Taliban,"When Pakistan’s army retook this strategic stronghold from the Taliban last month, it discovered how deeply Islamic militants had encroached on — and literally dug into — Pakistani territory.

Behind mud-walled family compounds in the Bajaur area, a vital corridor to Afghanistan through Pakistan’s tribal belt, Taliban insurgents created a network of tunnels to store arms and move about undetected.

Some tunnels stretched for more than half a mile and were equipped with ventilation systems so that fighters could withstand a long siege. In some places, it took barrages of 500-pound bombs to break the tunnels apart.

 

“These were not for ordinary battle,” said Gen. Tariq Khan, the commander of the Pakistan Frontier Corps, who led the army’s campaign against the Taliban in the area.

After three months of sometimes fierce fighting, the Pakistani Army controls a small slice of Bajaur. But what was initially portrayed as a paramilitary action to restore order in the area has become the most sustained military campaign by the Pakistani Army against the Taliban and its backers in Al Qaeda since Pakistan allied itself with the United States in 2001.

President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to make the conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan a top priority. The Bajaur campaign serves as a cautionary tale of the formidable challenge that even a full-scale military effort faces in flushing the Taliban and Al Qaeda from rugged northern Pakistan.

Pakistani officials describe the area as the keystone of an arc of militancy that stretches across the semiautonomous tribal region of Pakistan and into Afghanistan.

Under heavy pressure from the United States, Pakistani officials are vowing to dislodge the Taliban fighters and their Qaeda allies who have taken refuge in the tribal areas.

But a two-day visit to Loe Sam and Khar, the capital of Bajaur, arranged for foreign journalists by the Pakistani military, suggested that Pakistan had underestimated a battle-hardened opponent fighting tenaciously to protect its mountainous stronghold.

Taliban militants remain entrenched in many areas. Even along the road to Loe Sam, which the army laboriously cleared, sniper fire from militants continues.

The Pakistanis have also resorted to scorched-earth tactics to push the Taliban out, an approach that risks pushing more of their own citizens into the Taliban’s embrace.

After the Frontier Corps failed to dislodge the Taliban from Loe Sam in early August, the army sent in 2,400 troops in early September to take on a Taliban force that has drawn militants from across the tribal region, as well as a flow of fighters from Afghanistan.

Like all Pakistani soldiers, the troops sent here had been trained and indoctrinated to fight in conventional warfare against India, considered the nation’s permanent enemy, but had barely been trained in counterinsurgency strategy and tactics.

A Heap of Rubble
To save Loe Sam, the army has destroyed it.

The shops and homes of the 7,000 people who lived here are a heap of gray rubble, blown to bits by the army. Scraps of bedding and broken electric fans lie strewn in the dirt.

As Pakistani Army helicopters and artillery fired at militants’ strongholds in the region, about 200,000 people fled to tent camps for the displaced in Pakistan, to relatives’ homes or across the border into Afghanistan.

The aerial bombardment was necessary, Pakistani military officials say, to root out a well-armed Taliban force.

The Pakistani Army and the Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force responsible for security in the tribal areas, say 83 of their soldiers have died and 300 have been wounded since early August. That compares with 61 dead among forces of the American-led coalition in Afghanistan in the first four months of 2008.

At some point, probably over a period of several years, though no official could explain exactly when, the militants dug the series of well-engineered, interconnected tunnels.

The military now believes such tunnels lace much of Bajaur, where the militants still control large swaths of territory, General Khan said in an interview at his headquarters in Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province.

Bajaur is no ordinary prize. The militants seized it because of its strategic location beside Kunar Province in Afghanistan, where American and coalition forces are fighting the Taliban.

The area serves as a gateway to Kunar for Taliban fighters from other parts of the tribal belt, particularly Waziristan, to attack American forces.

Bajaur provides access south to Peshawar, one of the nation’s major cities, which is under threat from the Taliban.

And it offers a land bridge to more settled parts of Pakistan, like the Swat Valley to the east, where the army is struggling to contain the Taliban.

The fight is now a test of strength between the army and Tehrik-i-Taliban, the umbrella group of the Pakistani Taliban, allied with Al Qaeda, General Khan said.

The army will fight until it has captured all of Bajaur, he said.

Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks and Afghans form the hard core of its opponents, enlisting young, unemployed local men who join the militants for money and the prestige of sitting armed with a rifle in a double-cabin pickup, the favored Taliban vehicle, General Khan said.

American officials have said they believe some important Qaeda leaders are hiding in Bajaur.

In 2006, a United States missile attack from a remotely piloted aircraft on the village of Damadola was aimed at killing the top deputy to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahri.

Villagers in the Mohmand tribal agency, adjacent to Bajaur, said that they saw Mr. Zawahri in the northern part of Mohmand in September and that he had arrived with his wife to inspect a house, stayed the night, then left in a convoy of vehicles.

Advance of the Taliban
It was in response to the 2006 strike that the Taliban started taking over Bajaur, according to the government’s senior civilian official in the area, Shafirullah Khan.

Its methods were ruthless. Homeowners were coerced or paid to allow the militants to use their premises as bases, Mr. Khan said. Those who resisted were killed, often by beheading.

A well-known Afghan Taliban fighter, Zia ur-Rehman, directed and fortified the operation with his own men, bringing hundreds of fighters from Afghanistan last November, Mr. Khan said.

By last December, the Taliban had pushed government-armed local tribesmen, known as levees, out of their checkpoint at Loe Sam. By June, the Taliban had destroyed more than half of the 72 checkpoints in Bajaur.

The Taliban disrupted the workings of the civilian government, staging a suicide bombing of a truck carrying the salaries for teachers, and robbing a major bank, Mr. Khan said.

In August, as Pakistan’s resolve to take on the insurgents hardened, the army dispatched Maj. Ijaz Hussain and nearly 150 Frontier Corps troops to recapture the strategic junction of Loe Sam.

They had little idea what they were in for. With scarce ammunition and little water in fierce heat, they fought the Taliban in close combat but were quickly surrounded.

Two convoys sent to rescue them were decimated by militants, who attacked from their tunnels.

Ordered to retreat, the corpsmen escaped under cover of night through cornfields in sloshing rain, evading Taliban pursuers and gunfire from government helicopters.

In the failed recapture attempt, 29 Frontier Corps soldiers were killed and others were severely wounded, Col. Shahbaz Rasul of the Frontier Corps said.

Panic spread. A few days later, the crenellated fortress walls of the government compound in Khar were in danger of being overrun. More than 300 of the levees protecting the compound fled, leaving 35, Mr. Khan said.

“One of the basic problems of our fighting system is the intelligence failures,” said General Khan, the Frontier Corps commander. “Aggressive patrolling should have been done. It wasn’t done.”

Interviews with Pakistani Army officers, and a ride under army escort along the road from Khar to Loe Sam, showed that many of the soldiers seemed to be unprepared to fight a fast-moving, highly motivated and well-disguised insurgent force.

General Khan and other Pakistani military officials complained that they did not have the proper weapons and equipment to take on the militants, including radar and current intelligence.

The Taliban fighters, meanwhile, had heavy weapons and communications systems that could disguise their whereabouts, as well as the ability to home in on army radios.

Lt. Col. Javed Baluch, whose troops were sent to Bajaur in early September, said that even the terrain had surprised them. The khaki-colored earth dips and swerves every 25 yards; crevices suddenly become hillocks, and scattered clumps of trees and bushes can conceal snipers.

The militants were king, because the civilians had been ordered out of the area by the army in early August, in anticipation of the fight.

“The enemy had a lot of advantage,” Colonel Baluch said. “They knew the area completely. We were told we would meet foreign fighters and local fighters supporting them. The resistance unfolded differently.”

His mission was to clear Taang Khatta, a place thick with militants. It was a spot where the Frontier Corps forces had faced stiff resistance in August.

On the first day that his soldiers advanced on foot along the road to Taang Khatta, they were ambushed, he said.

The insurgents were invisible, hidden behind the thick mud walls of the compounds, their rifles poking through narrow slits.

“Small arms have no effect on the walls, and that’s what we were carrying,” Colonel Baluch said. “We did not know where to fire back.

The attack came from three directions, but the guerrillas made a mistake.

“When they shouted, ‘God is great,’ it was helpful to us,” Colonel Baluch said. The voices gave away their location.

In the end, it took five days and the loss of four men to conquer Taang Khatta, a mere bend in the road, just about a mile from the Khar headquarters.

Still, Colonel Baluch was lucky, he said. The push to capture another tiny place, Nisarabad, farther up the road, left 12 soldiers dead and 46 wounded.

The final assault on Loe Sam was led by Maj. Anwar Saeed, 37, who was experienced in fighting the Taliban in North Waziristan, the base of the most hardened militant fighters in the tribal belt.

It was ultimately captured on Oct. 21, and reduced to ruins in the process.

“When you capture a compound, the adjacent one becomes a firefight,” he said. “They were fighting and firing, and throwing grenades at us from 25 meters away.”

Yes, he knew the people who had lived here were now bereft. “I know many have suffered because of our actions,” Major Saeed said. “But the government is going to take care of them.”

What Lies Ahead
In Peshawar, however, some of the store owners from Loe Sam whose property was crushed said there were limits to their understanding.

They had heard no word about their return or about reconstruction, said Hajji Shakir, the owner of two stores in Loe Sam, as he sat on the floor of a crowded house with a group of fellow merchants, clutching the account books that he had escaped with.

“If the government doesn’t rebuild, we will be thieves, suicide bombers,” he said. “We will be forced to do these things.”

Mr. Khan, the chief government representative in Bajaur, said he had funds, provided by the United States Agency for International Development, for rebuilding. But he did not know when it would begin.

Some of the displaced said they were also angered by the high number of civilian deaths, many of them incurred when Pakistani jet fighters and helicopter gunships attacked Taliban redoubts.

The military said last week that 95 civilians had been killed in the Bajaur conflict, but the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said that the number seemed low.

There is no reliable count, because the commission was barred from investigating.

Similarly, there is little agreement about how many militants the army has killed in the three months of the Bajaur campaign.

The army says 1,500. But two officers, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were contradicting their superiors, said that the number appeared excessive. One army captain involved in the fighting said 300 seemed closer.

While the resistance had been reduced on the flat land, one thing was certain: as the military prepares to fight the militants in the mountainous areas in Bajaur, progress will be more difficult.

In his wood-paneled office, Col. Nauman Saeed, the officer in charge of day-to-day operations at the headquarters in Khar, said he was mired in a classic guerrilla conflict.

In September, he said, Taliban leaders in Bajaur had replenished their forces with 950 more men from Afghanistan.

“You keep killing them,” Colonel Saeed said, “but you still have them around.”"
157,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"Maybe it was the only shot heard for days in a neighborhood once ordered by the cadence of gunfire. Perhaps it was the smiles at checkpoints and the shouts of Iraqi policemen navigating the always snarled traffic. ""God's mercy on your parents,"" they beseeched. ""God's blessings on you."" Maybe it was the music box still playing ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" at a kiosk overflowing with Christmas tree decorations and heart-shaped red pillows.

For anyone returning to Baghdad after spending time here during its darkest days two years ago, when it was paralyzed by sectarian hatred and overrun by gunmen sowing despair, the conclusion seemed inescapable.

""The war has ended,"" said Heidar al-Abboudi, a street merchant.

The war in Iraq is indeed over, at least the conflict as it was understood during its first five years: insurgency, communal cleansing, gangland turf battles and an anarchic, often futile quest to survive. In other words, civil war -- though civil war was always too tidy a term for it. The entropy, for now at least, has run its course. So have many of the forces the United States so dangerously unleashed with its 2003 invasion, turning Iraq into an atomized, fractured land seized by a paroxysm of brutality. In that Iraq, the Americans were the final arbiter and, as a result, deprived anything they left behind of legitimacy.

Not to say that there is peace in Iraq. As many people are killed today as on any day in 2003 and 2004. Nor is there victory. For any Iraqi, the word, translated into Arabic, draws a dumbfounded look. Victory for whom? Certainly not the tens of thousands of civilians -- perhaps many more -- killed in the frenzied clashes of those once inchoate forces.

Rather, it is the day after.

Baghdad feels much as southern Lebanon did after an asymmetrical war there in 2006, between Israel and Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim movement that fought Israel to a draw. Survivors rose from the rubble of their homes, offices and stores with the satisfied smile of survival -- in war, its own victory. Then they beheld the destruction the fighting had wrought around them. Their faces turned grim as they realized the task at hand.

It is perhaps the day before, too.

""We don't know what's next,"" Shidrak George, a bystander, said April 9, 2003, as he watched men vainly assault Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdaus Square with chains, a sledgehammer and a cascade of rocks before making way for a bulky Marine M88 armored recovery vehicle to pull it down. The vehicle stopped for no one. It didn't have to.

He said everything remained ghamidh -- mysterious and unclear.

""We want to know how this turns out.""

A City of Walls
In Baghdad's 1,250-year history, its denizens have bestowed on it many names. To Abu Jaafar Mansour, its founder, it was the City of Peace, a capital whose walls were so perfectly circular that a contemporary suggested they were poured into a mold and cast.

Saddam Hussein's Baghdad was a testament to his megalomania, a strange sprawl with a disfigured sense of grandeur. After his fall, the city was stripped bare, revealing a modern creation of brick and mud, vulnerable like its people. It became a city of lanterns amid the blackouts, a city of ghosts shadowed by fear, a city that was mahjoura, forsaken. The architecture of occupation soon followed, falling like a curtain -- dull, unadorned concrete barriers colored in the somber gray of an overcast sky.

Baghdad today is a city of those walls.

The neighborhood of Dora looks like a maximum-security prison, complete with a rusted watchtower. Sadiyah has but one entrance, where waiting traffic sometimes snakes a mile. Sadr City is enclosed, then divided into three hamlets. Amariyah is surrounded. So are Hurriyah and Shuala, Bayaa and Amal. No one can see inside. No one can look out.

In two years, only the faces of the walls have changed.

They now declare the swagger of Iraqi army units: ""The Lion Brigade remains a lion,"" graffiti reads. They warn: ""Respect and be respected."" They celebrate: ""Long live the new Iraq."" They serve as a canvas for murals that forgo Iraq's more contemporary Arab past for its older Sumerian and Babylonian glory. They carry the advertisements of the travel agencies, moneychangers and realty offices they now protect. They bear the floral patterns that, not long ago, were more familiar on martyrs' posters.

Most of all, the walls conceal.

""A ruined state"" was the term Iraq's parliament speaker had for what the Americans have left behind those walls. Mahmoud al-Mashhadani said it in anger after he resigned in December. But the phrase resonates, in both Iraq as a whole, a weary landscape dominated in hues of brown, the color of poverty, and in Baghdad, a city where everything these days seems twisted or torn, bent or broken, snared in barbed wire that has lost its sheen. Every median has its piles of dirt and rubble, often both. Every curb has its soggy trash.

This war's end feels more truce than treaty, more respite than reconciliation. There is no revival or renaissance, no celebration. It manifests itself most in the simple lifting of a siege.

In a roundabout once known as Ali Baba Square, water occasionally flows from a bronze fountain portraying Kahramana, the slave girl who outwitted the 40 thieves of ""A Thousand and One Nights."" Boys play pool on tables lining the lazy Tigris River. Trucks along Abu Nawas Street bring flopping fish destined for plates of masgoof, an Iraqi specialty.

In Firdaus Square, where Hussein's statue once gave way to American tanks whose barrels read ""Beastly Boy"" and ""Bloodlust"" and U.S. soldiers blared Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" over Humvee speakers, two students, Hussein al-Abbas and Amjad Abdel Hamza, took pictures of each other near the swings and park benches.

""For the memories,"" Abbas said.

Behind them, a poster reads: ""Law builds the nation.""

Fragile is the term American officials rely on to describe this Iraq, and indeed, it is that. At this moment, the country feels as though it could recover, economically if not physically, blessed by oil reserves that are potentially the largest in the world. Crumbling, it feels as though it could just as well remain a powerless, pliant country buckling under its own weight, dependent on a United States that seems determined to dictate its future.

The spectrum between those poles relies on the question of power. The struggle for that power -- a series of elections this year is one avenue, and money, guns and repression are another, more familiar means -- pervades almost every aspect of life in Iraq today.

Fragile, repeat the Americans. Dangerous, say many Iraqis, bracing for more violence.

""Before the storm, there's always quiet,"" said Amal Salman, living with her family in Karrada, above a street lined with vendors hawking hats emblazoned with ""Budweiser,"" ""Wisconsin"" and ""Baylor Crew."" A kiosk offered posters of Turkish soap operas that have become a sensation in Baghdad and elsewhere in the Arab world. Pictures of Hossam al-Rassam, a popular Iraqi singer, were in short supply.

When she was 13, Salman chronicled the fall of Hussein in her diary. ""No one realizes they are gone, all of them, forever,"" she wrote in 2003. She stayed optimistic during Baghdad's darkest chapter. ""The sun will set today, but it always rises again. Everything rises again,"" she said then. ""I don't know how to express it, but I understand it.""

Now 18, she worried.

""It's always most dangerous when it's calm,"" she said.

The Culture of the Shoe
Standing in Firdaus Square on April 9, 2003, the Marine recovery vehicle doing its part, it was difficult to imagine that the United States truly understood the country it had inherited that day. Iraq was a place brutalized by war and tyranny, imbued with ambivalence about the future, shaped by yearning for the past. It never abided by American preconceptions. It never hewed to the United States' construct of what a country should be.

In months, the unanticipated forces that would shape Iraq were soon unleashed -- a Shiite Muslim revival, disenfranchisement of Sunnis, the import of a radical strain of Islam, the hardening of sectarian and ethnic identities, and the onset of a lawless culture of men with guns. An Iraqi friend once called their legacy the culture of the shoe, known here as the kundura.

""When anyone is against you, when anyone has differences with me, I will put a kundura in his mouth, I will shove a kundura down his throat, I will hit him with a kundura, and so on,"" he said at the time. ""We live in a kundura culture.""

Today, many of those forces seem to have fitfully run their course.

""There is a disintegration in the entire sectarian establishment in Iraq,"" said Wamidh Nadhme, a political science professor sitting in the Adhamiyah quarter, over a leisurely lunch of a wintertime soup that mixed turnips with balls of ground meat. ""Everyone now is trying to wash their hands of the blood that had stained them.""

His once perilous neighborhood was now quiet. There was neither the staccato crack of gunfire nor the dull thud of helicopters. His gate was unlocked. So was his front door.

His son, Jamal, nodded in agreement, but then offered a caveat.

""The embers are still glowing,"" he cautioned his father.

Mercury might best describe Iraq's politics these days, skipping, rolling and congealing, pushed and pulled by forces that always feel surreptitious and furtive.

The overarching Shiite alliance, once blessed by Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, has crumbled. The figure of one of its leaders, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, stricken by cancer and ravaged by its treatment, seems a metaphor for its fortunes. The bloc that claimed to speak on behalf of reticent Sunnis has splintered, unable to agree on a candidate to replace the speaker of parliament, himself partial to the kundura. It faces competition from the Sons of Iraq movement, which is made up of many who have surrendered the insurgency for a seat at the table. The Shiite prime minister is rallying Sunnis against Kurds. Some of his allies are those same former insurgents.

Shiite Arab, Sunni Arab and Kurd were always facile descriptions of Iraq. Now they make hardly any sense before the constellation of combustible alliances jockeying to answer the questions at the heart of Iraqi politics today: How strong will the central government in Baghdad be, and what coalition of interests will secure power?

""The flames have disappeared. It's true,"" said Abboudi, the street vendor in crowded Karrada, as he sat at his well-stocked store of men's clothes. ""But the war continues among the politicians. Until this moment, there is a great struggle going on among them.""

In that, 2009 feels much like that April day in 2003. Then, as now, one war's end was the preamble for another, far greater struggle. Much was ambiguous and indistinct. Consequences were unintended.

Like today, it was all ghamidh."
158,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"Nadhim Khalil wears the clothes of the cleric he is. He bears the scars of the insurgent he was. And in a country where business these days is power, he talks the speech of the merchant he has become, plying his trade in a contest for authority.

Imbued with the swagger of youth, lording over this oasis-like town on a bend of the Tigris River, Khalil has power, the fruits of a singularly Iraqi odyssey that has taken this scion of a religious family from the leadership of the local branch of al-Qaeda in Iraq, responsible for a reign that saw residents executed in the streets, into the generous arms of the American military and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, his erstwhile foes.

Khalil's analysis is blunt: He used to be on the losing side.

His formula is simple: With God, guns and money, he is now the authority in town.

""I'm sure the Americans will leave after a little while, and there's nothing I achieve by killing them now. I could kill them anytime, anywhere, and so what?"" he asked. ""In the beginning, the thought was that you could achieve your goal with weapons, but honestly? That investment has shown no return. That company has shown no profit.""

Khalil's ascent here is a legacy of the war that has all but ended and the struggle that has begun in Iraq, shaped by the expediency of American tactics to quell the insurgency and the combustible, shifting landscape those choices have left behind. War and occupation shattered old notions of power here, embedded in patronage and tradition. In places like Thuluyah, new leaders and forces are emerging, redrawing the maps of towns and regions that, in quick succession, have passed from the hands of Saddam Hussein, through the throes of the insurgency and into today's far murkier contest.

Fierce in its customs, Thuluyah is a microcosm of Sunni Muslim regions of the country, residents like to say. If so, the town is a sober harbinger. Khalil, often forthright, sometimes persuasive and occasionally thuggish, has become the strongman.

Just 30 years old, Khalil has inherited from his family the town's biggest mosque, where brimming crowds gather on Fridays for his stentorian sermons. He heads the council that oversees the hundreds of armed men who deserted the insurgency for U.S.-funded units known as the Sons of Iraq, outnumbering the police and army unit stationed here. The mention of Khalil's name -- Mullah Nadhim, as he is known here -- ensures passage through their checkpoints. He heads a council of tribal leaders that provides a channel to Maliki, who offered his hand in friendship in a meeting in Baghdad's Green Zone.

The elected city council can only watch and complain -- in whispers -- about a man they fear. The town's elders scoff at his age and pedigree, with a wayward glance.

""My opinion?"" asked Abdullah Jabbouri, a council member and former general. He paused, smiling a little sheepishly.

""Anyone who has absolute power becomes dangerous, even to himself,"" he said.

Renown as an Insurgent
Khalil has long enjoyed prominent standing in this town of 50,000, graced by orchards and orange groves. His father, Mahmoud, was the head of the Caliphs Mosque, the town's largest, which Khalil inherited at 18. So was his grandfather, Khalil. In the days of Hussein, he had secured a measure of fame -- or perhaps notoriety -- when he was questioned for sometimes explicit criticism of the government in his sermons -- that it should build schools, not palaces, that its rule lacked the justice of Islam's forebears.

But it was not until 2003, in the months after Hussein's fall, that he won renown with a message as incendiary as it was harsh -- against the Americans, of the need to defend Sunnis against Shiites. Even today, some recall a sermon he delivered that November.

In it, he spoke of three men who competed to be the most vile. The first saw a woman carrying wood atop her head. He beat her. The second then tore off her clothes and raped her. The third stood back. When the others asked what he would do to prove his wickedness, the man laughed. That was my mother, he told them.

Khalil paused as he finished the story. The mosque fell silent. The mother, he declared, his voice rising again, represented Iraq, and the men were those betraying her.

""The occupation is like a cancer,"" he shouted, ""and it has to be removed.""

In those days, Khalil had insisted that he was only ""fighting with his tongue."" His zeal soon drew him into the ranks of an incipient insurgency, leading 30 armed men and meeting colleagues in Baghdad, where he sometimes sought shelter at the Um al-Qura mosque. He ventured to the Anbar province capital of Ramadi, towns in Diyala province, and across the border to Syria. The U.S. military jailed him twice: as prisoner No. 159705 when he spent nearly six months in the massive prison at Abu Ghraib in 2004, and as No. 200331 when he was incarcerated for a similar stint at Camp Cropper in Baghdad nearly two years later. By his count, U.S. soldiers searched his house 67 times. They occasionally brought dogs, he said, to inspect his mosque.

By August 2006, after a meeting in Homs, Syria, he had joined al-Qaeda in Iraq, a homegrown Sunni movement that U.S. officials say is led by foreigners and that embraced a radical strain of Islam.

Unlike other regions of Iraq, there was never any ambiguity in Thuluyah about the occupation. From the beginning, it was despised. The town was the scene of one of the first efforts at counterinsurgency, when 4,000 U.S. troops, along with helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, moved through in June 2003. They killed three males, including a 15-year-old whose body was left for hours, swelling under a burning sun.

But even the occupation's fiercest opponents were startled by the severity of al-Qaeda, which ruled Thuluyah for 16 months starting in 2006. Men deemed collaborators were dragged from their homes and cars, sometimes executed in the street with a bullet to the back of the head. One man, a policeman's brother, was beheaded with the dull edge of a shovel. In all, residents say, 216 people were killed. No one could smoke in the streets.

""In theory, it was good,"" Khalil said of al-Qaeda.

But he realized that what he deemed the excesses of implementation were turning sentiment against it. These days, he calls himself contrite; he said he only wanted to fight Americans, not Shiites in neighboring Balad and certainly not his own people. But he acknowledged, too, that he was eventually forced to weigh the costs and benefits.

""Four years of fighting, and we didn't achieve anything,"" he said in his house, adorned with a Koranic inscription on the wall that reads: ""God forgives all sins. Truly, He is often forgiving and most merciful.""

""That company went bankrupt,"" Khalil said matter-of-factly. There was little hint of penitence, less of remorse. ""The past is closed now,"" he said. ""It failed, and I don't like to remember the years of failure.""

In June 2007, Khalil turned against his allies, declaring war from his mosque.

""Al-Qaeda must depart, or face from us what they may not expect,"" he recalled saying. ""Throw them out of our villages. Have no mercy on them, whether young or old.""

Three times, al-Qaeda in Iraq loyalists tried to kill him. On Oct. 19 that year, they planted a bomb under his chair in the mosque, injuring 136 worshipers. Khalil suffered 30 wounds that left dark scars on his left arm and left leg. But within a few months, working with the U.S. military, police and men who deserted al-Qaeda in Iraq for an American-backed militia of former fighters, Khalil crippled the group. Residents estimate that 80 of its men were arrested and 70 others were killed -- 50 by the U.S. military and 20 by police. Only a dozen or so fighters remain, haunting the gardens and farms around the town.

In his own estimation, Khalil was the last man standing.

He has shaved his beard, its wispiness once indicative of his youth. In a reception room painted soft pink, he unabashedly displays a picture of himself with a sniper rifle, surrounded by Iraqi security forces, former insurgents turned American allies and a U.S. soldier, smiling broadly. To visitors, always gracious, he speaks with the fervor of the converted.

""I have a new company,"" he declared.

Smiling, he added, ""You can't bring the Neanderthal to live in a globalized age.""

But he still calls himself an Islamist, and to his followers, his words remain harsh.

""Our country is occupied and our bodies are torn apart, but we shouldn't forget our families in Palestine,"" he proclaimed in a sermon recently to an overflow crowd in his austere mosque, its white walls gouged by shrapnel from his assassination attempt.

""Those sons of monkeys, enemies of God and killers of prophets,"" he declared, his voice rising in denunciation of Jews, ""are killing our brothers and sisters in Palestine.""

A Void After Hussein
Under Hussein, Thuluyah enjoyed the perks of patronage and loyalty. Some residents estimate that as many as 90 percent of the townspeople were Baath Party members, a fourth of them employed by the army, government or intelligence service.

That world crumbled in April 2003. The tribes -- powerful clans with the names of Jabbouri, Khazraji, Ubaidi and Bufarraj -- filled the void for a while, then made way for insurgent groups and eventually al-Qaeda in Iraq. Its departure left a contested landscape, in which the government, represented by no more than 70 soldiers, is a bit player.

The city council is universally despised, castigated as corrupt and dismissed as impotent. Tribal leaders hold sway. On a recent day, the sheiks of the region's tribes met in Balad to negotiate blood money for 14 construction workers from that town whom al-Qaeda members from Thuluyah had executed with a bullet to the back of the head in 2006. But even the sheiks complain they no longer enjoy the same writ in a terrain shaped by force of arms and patronage that comes through ties to the American military and the government.

Khalil calls the perspective of the tribal leaders ""limited.""

That leaves Khalil himself, who is called commander by the 700 members of the Sons of Iraq in the region. In mismatched uniforms or civilian clothes, they man checkpoints on the town's main road, draped in bandoleers and waving walkie-talkies. He heads a council of 10 tribal leaders established last year by Maliki, the prime minister's tentative but far-reaching attempt to cultivate rural support. He said he meets with the U.S. military every two weeks. Each Tuesday, he gathers a council in Thuluyah with the mayor and heads of the police, city council and army to review security here.

""He has helped maintain peace and stability in the region while supporting the populace's need for the same,"" said Lt. Col. David Doherty, a spokesman for the U.S. military in northern Iraq, the region that includes Thuluyah.

At the city council headquarters, a simple building near the town's entrance, pockmarked by bullets, Jabbouri was more circumspect. A towering man, dressed in a checkered kaffiyeh, he represents Thuluyah's past. He was a general under Hussein, a veteran of the war with Iran. He is a lawyer and tribal elder. A council member, he has ambitions to sit in parliament. At first, he deflected queries about Khalil.

""This is a deep question,"" the 68-year-old Jabbouri replied.

But over thin cups of scalding sweet tea, the conversation unfolded.

""He's from a respectable family,"" one of his colleagues volunteered.

""What?"" Jabbouri gruffly responded. ""Is he the head of a tribe? How many houses belong to him? Five? He's not a thinker. He's more like an adolescent.""

The criticisms tumbled out, growing in boldness. Khalil's conversion was akin to a cleric banning alcohol, then mixing the first drink. Money and power have made him a pharaoh. His guns, in the hands of his men, have left the city council with no qudra, or capability. Though elected to office, the men find themselves on the outside looking in.

""All we can do is write. We can't carry anything out,"" one colleague said.

""The Americans put him in charge,"" another added, too fearful to give his name. ""They gave him the key. From where else would he have gotten it?""

Jabbouri shook his head. ""His ambition stretches beyond the sky,"" he said grimly.

Speaking Like a Candidate
""The fight now is the fight over the finger,"" Khalil said over a lunch of roast lamb and rice, grilled fish, okra and more lamb, after delivering his sermon.

He meant the coming election and the indigo stain Iraqis receive after voting. He meant, too, that he himself planned to run for parliament, hoping to represent Thuluyah.

These days, Khalil is a man about town. He got married and got respectable. He mixes easily with worshipers, his fighters and the workers renovating his mosque. Even in January, nearly a year before parliamentary elections, he sounds like a candidate.

Through his intervention, he said, the Americans have funded 20 projects for the town, from paving 10 miles of roads to bringing clean water for thousands of families. He still oversees salaries for the Sons of Iraq. He has found 400 people jobs in the army and police. He has secured compensation for 1,500 people who suffered injuries in fighting.

""I have a lot of credit from the people at this point,"" he said.

Across from the mosque, Shihab Khaled watched a butcher slaughter a sheep, dragging the knife along the belly of the animal as it hung from a meat hook.

""They used to massacre people like this, and it was ordinary,"" he said under his breath. Al-Qaeda in Iraq killed his brother Zahid, a policeman like him, in August 2007. He himself never wore his uniform in public. ""It's all over now. It's passed like a dream.""

He said he thanked God first, ""and second, the efforts of Mullah Nadhim.""

But there is something familiar about the reluctance of many others to talk.

""He who is scared stays peaceful,"" goes a proverb sometimes uttered in the town. It was often pronounced after Hussein's fall, in the ensuing anarchy. But it holds truth today, too. There is fear here, the sense in places where law is arbitrary that fewer words are better.

""He still needs time to build trust,"" said Suleiman Kanoush, a 43-year-old government employee. ""We still need time to give him our trust again.""

Trust, though, is not Khalil's power."
159,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit," At noon Tuesday, there was the explosion. Gunfire followed, and 33 people were dead, pieces of their corpses mixing with stagnant water, trash and soggy scraps of food. At noon Wednesday, there were the atlal.

The word in Arabic means the remains or ruins, the traces of something left behind. The atlal of Tuesday's attack, one of two in the past week that killed scores in the capital and its environs, were spent bullet cartridges, catching the glint of a morning sun, that survivors accused soldiers of firing at them in the chaos and confusion that followed the blast.

The atlal were the orphaned boy who had been selling plastic bags for a few cents. They were the vegetable seller whose 18-month-old daughter was ripped from his grasp as he was hurled to the asphalt. They were the relatives standing at a morgue that housed the remains of their families together with the remnants of the bomber who killed them.

""Neither the American nor Iraqis will try him,"" said Rahim Abdullah, whose aunt and cousin were among those refrigerated inside. ""He'll be judged in heaven.""

In 2003, when America began its occupation, bombings with half the casualties of Tuesday's suggested the United States might not prevail. Today, when America and its Iraqi allies seem to be winning, the attack failed to make the front page of the government newspaper.

""No one values the victims anymore,"" said Mohammed Awad, another relative standing near the morgue, under a sun that washed Abu Ghraib of color.

Even before the fall of Saddam Hussein, Abu Ghraib, a desolate swath on Baghdad's western outskirts, was a symbol. The prison here was the worst of Hussein's hellholes, a place whose name spoke to the horrors of his ubiquitous terror. When he issued an amnesty emptying the prison and others in October 2002, it foreshadowed the tumult that would ensue after his fall six months later, as a country stepped from a prison cell into the sunlight. Abu Ghraib became an axis of the insurgency, once one of Iraq's most dangerous locales. Its prison was taken over by U.S. soldiers, who photographed their own sadistic treatment of inmates.

On Wednesday, the day after the market bombing, Abu Ghraib was a symbol of death's anonymity, in a conflict where hundreds of people still die every month, even as a sense of the ordinary returns.

Pieces of flesh collected in a black plastic bag were tossed near the market, its stalls built of tattered canvas, soiled blankets, and rickety wood and iron. The stench of death still hung along muddy puddles of blood that were something in between red and brown. Barbed wire snagged plastic bags, fluttering in a forlorn breeze. Scenes of doves, rivers and a sun setting over palm trees were painted on blast walls, dissonant with a landscape that, from its dusty palm fronds to its dead grass, was painted solely in grays and browns.

""It is forbidden to stop,"" a concrete barrier read at the very place police Maj. Gen. Maarid Abdel-Hassan stopped Tuesday to tour the market before the suicide bomber rushed his car and detonated explosives that tore through the crowd of men, women and children.

""We won't forget,"" said Ahmed Naji, whose brother Ali lay in a hospital bed, a tube in his nose draining blood from his wounds. ""We won't forget what happened.""

Ali was crossing the street when the assailant, dressed in a camouflage police uniform, threw himself toward Abdel-Hassan. The blast tore Ali's infant daughter, Aya, from his arms, flinging her down.

""Thank God,"" he said simply of her survival.

""It was like the day Baghdad fell,"" his brother Ahmed said. ""No, it was worse.""

Abdel-Hassan said insurgents fired on his men, unleashing gun battles that raged as his car sped away. Police stationed in the area blamed soldiers in his convoy for firing randomly. Survivors at the hospital, along with doctors and staff, insisted the general's soldiers simply lost control, pouring gunfire at survivors as they staggered through the market.

""Anyone who moved was shot,"" Ali said.

""It's an army of occupation,"" a man attending his wounds said under his breath.

Ahmed Tahsin, so gaunt he looks younger than his 12 years, sold plastic bags in the market for about 20 cents. His father was dead, in a car accident before the war. His mother abandoned him. His half sister, Noura, had raised him and his brother, Hossam.

""It's hurting,"" Ahmed cried in the room next door, as a doctor tried to snake a tube through his nose to drain blood from surgeries that removed part of his stomach and intestine. His spleen was, in the doctor's words, shattered. ""I can't bear it!"" he cried again.

""Shut up!"" the doctor barked. ""It's for your own good.""

""Don't let him put it in my nose,"" the boy begged, sobbing, swallowed by the blanket that was tossed over him. ""Don't let him. Somebody please talk to him.""

His brother leaned against a grimy wall, crying.

""What did he do to deserve this?"" Hossam said. ""Why? He didn't do anything wrong.""

The sun poured down outside. It does that in Iraq, relentless as it batters. Abdullah and Awad stood with other men near the refrigerated morgue, sweat gathering on their brows as they waited to collect their relatives. They couldn't travel in the hours after the attack. All the roads were closed.

""They wouldn't let anyone, not a single person, come in or out,"" Abdullah said.

He went that night to retrieve his 28-year-old cousin, Raed Sabar Abed. He returned Wednesday to bury his 63-year-old aunt, Baraka Hussein Khalaf. Her body was stored inside, along with nine other corpses and the remains of the bomber's legs.

""A nightmare,"" Abdullah said.

""I want to know the dialogue that goes on between them right now. I hope they ask him why he killed them,"" he said. ""I want them to know his answer.""

The Karkh Cemetery is a few miles from the market, which was abandoned Wednesday but for a few vendors selling tomatoes, eggplants, squash, bananas, oranges and the potatoes for which Abu Ghraib is known. A ledger sat on the desk at the cemetery's entrance.

""Rasoul Fadhil Abbas"" read the first name, born in 1988. ""Abdel-Majid Hamid Ahmed"" read the second, born in 1995. ""Mohammed Khudeir"" read the third, born in 1998.

Thirteen more names followed. The cause of death was identical for each.

Infijar, it read. ""Explosion.""

The bodies were buried under piles of dirt not yet settled. The names were scrawled by hand in cheap concrete. A palm frond jutted from the dirt of each grave. Occasionally there was incense. A sign of the newly dead, black crows fluttered near denuded eucalyptus trees.

""God have mercy on them,"" said the gravedigger, Akram Ahmed."
160,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"A sandstorm always makes a dreary Baghdad drearier. The sun turns to a moon in a funereal gray sky. Time surrenders its procession, as dawn melts into a cloudy day that feels like dusk. Common these days, the storms bring a gauze of grit that settles over everything, and the eyebrows of Pvt. Bassem Kadhim were no exception.

Standing at a checkpoint at the entrance of the Baghdad Central Railway Station, he leaned toward a car. His eyes narrowed, as he cocked his head in recognition.

Um Kalthoum, the Egyptian diva of another generation, played on a scratchy cassette. It was the song ""Siret al-Hob,"" her peerless voice soaring over the strains of a forlorn violin.

""Let me listen for just a moment,"" Kadhim told the driver, ""then I'll let you pass.""

He listened. ""From a whisper of love, I found myself in love,"" Um Kalthoum sang. ""I melted in love, spending morning and night at its door."" And he let the car pass.

There is a new vigor to the cadence of the Baghdad train station beyond his checkpoint, revived after a long slumber. But like the legendary singer, it evokes a lost world. Two clock towers stand like sentinels on each side of a turquoise dome built half a century ago. Musty ticket counters advertise lines that no longer run: to Mosul, to Husaybah, and across the border, to Syria and Turkey. Flickering chandeliers illuminate distinctions -- Couchette Class, Tourist Class -- that no longer matter.

The station is a door of sorts, as is the train parked there.

Through it is another Iraq, far from the country today that is at once so resilient yet so uncertain. This is an Iraq imbued with the recollection, sometimes imagined, of a past not yet bloodied. It is a nation where names still evoke a place, not an occupier's crimes and excesses -- Abu Ghraib, Haditha, even Baghdad. It is a country that unfurls between two rivers, filled with longing but bereft of borders of sect and ethnicity that cut through even the smallest towns with the blunt edge of a blast wall or a massacre's lingering memory.

""On the train,"" said Ahmed Murad, boarding the car, ""you go straight ahead.""

At 6:25 p.m., the horn blew, and workers and students, good sons going home to their families, well-wishers and mourners threw their jackets, shoulder bags stretched taut, sacks stuffed with sandwiches and tightly rolled carpets on the racks overhead. They settled into frayed green leather seats, with murmurs like that of an audience before a play.

The train had no number. There is only one, bound each evening for Basra, 340 miles to the south.

The horn sounded again at 6:30. The train's six carriages heaved, then stumbled ahead, departing on time. The wheels shrieked, the clanging metal otherworldly, and a landscape always so claustrophobic and demarcated fell effortlessly into the train's wake.

""Is that Dora?"" someone asked idly.

""Kadhimiyah?"" another wondered.

Wind poured through the car as the train gathered speed. The colored banners of Shiite Muslim devotion faded from view. So did checkpoints adorned with plastic flowers, gathering dust in the storm. The train rumbled past blurred scenes of traffic snarled as cars waited for inspection, past police trucks with sirens wailing and past blast walls plastered with tattered election posters. Soldiers were illuminated in the streaming headlights of cars, recognizable for a moment before they fell back into the dark of night.

For perhaps the first time since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, an American convoy stopped for someone in Baghdad. It waited on the road to the airport, as the train cut across.

By 6:54, the train reached full speed, and Aqeel Moussa dragged on a cigarette, watching a timeless scene of squat houses spilling beneath date palms.

""There's no Sunni, there's no Shiite here. We're all part of the same hand,"" he said, thoughts wandering. ""I know someone only through the conversation we share.""

In spirit, if not reality, the train is part of an older line and an older Middle East, the product of a 19th-century vision of the Ottoman Empire and its German allies to build the Berlin-Baghdad Express, eventually ending in Basra and running unfettered across the borderless expanse of Turkey, Syria and Iraq.

With little fanfare, service began again in December to Basra. For 18 months, it had been too dangerous for the train to venture through the treacherous stretch of eucalyptus trees, date palms and ocher-colored villages spilling south of Baghdad, an area once known as the Triangle of Death. Snipers took potshots at the train. The railway's director general was ambushed and shot in both legs in 2004. A bridge near Latifiyah, in the heart of the triangle, was blown up time and again.

These days, though, the train is full, its fare of $7 a fifth of what a taxi can cost. And as it passed Latifiyah, no one seemed to deem the threat too great anymore.

""The evidence is that I'm sitting here,"" said Hilal Karim, bound for a job in Basra.

The soiled green drapes of Car 499 hung over cracked windows. The springs of Seat 23 were broken. A few of the lights worked overhead, one of them drawing a moth that danced along the roof, frenetic and tireless. Brown walls added to the drabness.

""Mohammed, leave open the door!"" one passenger shouted toward the back of the carriage, jabbing two fingers clasped around a cigarette. ""Let's let the smoke get out!""

His butt joined sunflowers seeds littering the floor.

""What are you doing? Trying to light the train on fire?"" he shouted at a youth in front of him who vainly tried to prop a burning stick of incense where a screw once was.

""Is this Latifiyah?"" another passenger asked.

""Mahmudiyah?"" his friend guessed.

A medley of songs played from cellphones. There were Iraqi artists like Yas Khudr. Jokingly, someone offered a martial ode to Saddam Hussein. A Syrian singer named Asala performed another song by Um Kalthoum. ""I fear for you, and fear you might forget me,"" it went. ""But longing for you kept me awake, overtaken by nostalgia.""

The words were barely audible to Wala Hassan, standing at the train's open door.

""I'm fed up with this life,"" he volunteered, sipping scalding tea.

Nineteen, married and the father of a 9-month-old baby named Ali, Hassan had come to Baghdad for work. It was his fifth trip on the train. The night before, he had slept in the street, hoping to be first in line for an application to the police. It didn't matter.

""There's no future, I swear to God,"" he said. He tossed the dregs of his tea out the door and stood up. ""I don't even have a single dinar to give to my baby.""

He propped a sinewy arm against the exit and forced a smile of hospitality. With a faraway stare, he looked out the train at other lives that were lived. His wasn't yet. ""When I stand here, I want to take the grief from my heart and throw it out the door.""

He smiled again, tightly. ""It feels good to talk,"" he said.

The train slowed. ""Are we in Musayyib?"" someone asked.

A few rows away, another song played. It was ""This Iraq,"" by Taysir al-Safir. ""We will light your roads with candles,"" he sang. ""We will dry the tears from your eyes.""

The history of Iraq's internecine war in 2006 and 2007 has yet to be written. It lacks even a name. Sometimes it is called ""the sectarian time"" or ""sectarian war."" Occasionally, ""the events."" Often, one word suffices, taifiyya, which simply means sectarianism.

The checkpoints that litter Iraq's roads, sometimes every 100 yards or so, are a legacy of that war. In a country rife with borders and barriers, barricades and barbed wire, many find them loathsome. Inspections are arbitrary, soldiers are sometimes rude and delays can stretch hours, in ribbons of traffic that can unwind for more than a mile.

""It always bothered you when you saw American convoys stopping us, not letting us move in our own country,"" said Ali Zeid, a 20-year-old student who had been visiting in Baghdad.

""And now Iraqis have caught the disease from the Americans,"" added his cousin, Abdullah Hamid. ""It's like a virus spreading through your computer. You can't delete it.""

Hamid, garrulous and stout, studies computers, but his true love, he said, is for poetry, ranging from the work of Umru al-Qais, from before the dawn of Islam, to Nizar Qabbani, who died in 1998. Hamid's favorite line goes like this, inspired by the taifiyya: ""Tears of Baghdad, millions of tears. Who do I have in Baghdad, crying for me, as I cry for her?""

There is a poetry to the train, he said. It is the education of a journey.

""You have an idea of the country you live in when you pass through it so freely,"" he said, his head leaning against a window coated with dust. ""I want to move from place to place. If I can't know about the world, at least I can know about my own country.""

More songs played, one of them an ode to a train.

""I remain waiting at the track, counting how many stations till Basra,"" sang Yas Khudr, from a muffled speaker. ""Did they reach Tel Alaham, or have they passed it?""

As midnight approached, more fell asleep, save for a rowdy bunch in Row 29. By 2 a.m., even they had quieted, though passengers still stirred whenever the train slowed.

""Where are we now?"" one asked.

""What town are we in?"" wondered another. ""Samawah or Suq al-Shuyukh?""

Toward Basra, the sky hinted gray. Gas burned from oil wells in the distance, like bonfires on the horizon. Flags for Shiite saints again became distinct. So did the graffiti scrawled in black along the walls. Checkpoints returned, with the borders they drew. The train rattled past stagnant canals filled with trash in a city once Iraq's most beautiful.

The train stopped at 5:58 a.m. ""Welcome to our Basra Railway Station,"" the wall read, near a ticket counter that offered ""High Class Reserve."" The train was two minutes early."
161,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"Across the street from the tidy rows of tombstones in the British cemetery, mute testimony to the soldiers of an earlier occupation, Mustafa Muwaffaq bears witness to the quieter side of the United States' six-year-old presence in Iraq.

In wraparound sunglasses, shorts and shoes without socks, the burly 20-year-old student waxes eloquent about his love for heavy metal of all kinds: death, thrash, black. But none of it compares, he says, to the honky-tonk of Alan Jackson, whose tunes he strums on his acoustic guitar at night, pining for a life as far away as a passport will take him.

""You know, I wanna go to Texas and be a country boy,"" he said, as he stood in the sweltering shade of Baghdad's Academy of Fine Arts. ""I wanna be a cowboy, and I wanna sing like one.""

All occupations eventually end. When this one does, history's narratives will be shaped by the cacophony it wrought -- the carnage unleashed by the U.S.-led invasion that threatened Iraq's notion of itself as a country and that will haunt generations to come.

But the whispers may linger just as long -- the far quieter way in which two cultures that often found it difficult to share the same space intersected to reshape Iraq's language, culture and sensibility. From tattoos of Metallica to bellybutton piercings, from posters for a rap concert in Baghdad to stories parents tell their naughty children in Fallujah of the Americans coming to get them, the occupation has already left its mark.

There is the bellicose language of the checkpoint: ""Go"" and ""Stop"" (often rendered as ""stob"" in a language with no ""p""), along with a string of American expletives that Iraqi children imitate with zeal. In parks along the Tigris River, they play ""tafteesh,"" Arabic for inspection. Iraqi troops, sometimes indistinguishable from their U.S. counterparts, don the sunglasses considered effeminate in the time of Saddam Hussein.

Some Iraqi youths even dip Skoal tobacco.

""It's inevitable that they're going to leave a trace on us after they depart,"" said Yahya Hussein, a soccer coach, former player and denizen of Baghdad's Karrada neighborhood.

'These Are the Times'
Hussein left Kawkab al-Sharq cafe -- named for a legendary Egyptian singer of another era -- where waiters ferried tea, Nescafe and a water pipe known as a nergilla, a word taken from Persian. His family's history in Karrada stretches back 11 generations, and as he strolled along the neighborhood's main thoroughfare, he spoke with the authority of experience.

""All this,"" he said, pointing at a kiosk, ""came after the occupation.""

Rickety stands along the street overflowed with goods. Toy guns emblazoned with the moniker ""Super Police"" sat next to imitation handcuffs and walkie-talkies. A doll dressed in fatigues, with dog tags around its neck, carried an M-16 rifle, familiar to Iraqis as a weapon of the U.S. military. With a squeeze of the doll's hand, Freddie Mercury belted out Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" to a street speaking Arabic.

""These are the times,"" Hussein said.

Bootleg copies of ""Star Trek,"" ""Valkyrie"" and ""Marley & Me"" were on sale, along with CDs by Eminem, 50 Cent and Massari. On a wall was an ad for a concert by Rap Boys, billed as the ""first and biggest rap party in Baghdad.""

Youths asked a barber across the street for the latest haircut, which they call ""spiky""; one barber insisted that the name came from a soldier's nickname for his military dog. The soldier's version of a crew cut is called ""Yankee"" (or, sometimes, ""bankee"").

Businesses hawked camouflage-patterned men's underwear. ""Harley,"" a kind of biker boot, went for $125. ""Texas,"" the cowboy version, cost $100.

For each item, Hussein had a simple phrase: ""after the suqut,"" the fall of Saddam Hussein.

The Long Perspective
Iraq remains a proud country, its people bridling at what they see as the condescension inherent in the United States' modern-day equivalent of a civilizing mission. History, thousands of years of it, forms the refrain of any conversation: Mesopotamia gave birth to civilization, and at its medieval zenith, as Europe slumbered, Baghdad was a city of racetracks, law schools, museums, libraries, hospitals, zoos and insane asylums.

The country's past shamed its present, and in the wake of Hussein's fall in 2003, many Iraqis, however suspicious, were willing to give the Americans the benefit of the doubt. Now, many blame them for everything from sectarian strife to Baghdad's disrepair. The only kind of American most Iraqis have met is a young, gun-toting soldier, and a look of scornful incomprehension often greets a question about the Americans' cultural legacy.

""What are they leaving behind?"" asked Mohammed Chayan, a 45-year-old painter sitting with friends at the Madarat Cafe and Gallery, near a wall of concrete barriers.

""There's never really been interaction with society,"" he said. ""When they came to visit, it wasn't artists who showed up. It was soldiers coming down from their tanks.""

""They were isolated,"" admitted Mohammed Rasim Kasim, a filmmaker and photographer. ""But,"" he added, ""I have to disagree with my colleague.""

Kasim, a bearish, cheerful man, said that before 2003 he had traveled only to neighboring Jordan. Since then, he has visited the United States, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Germany and Austria. And an image lingers from his travels: recognizing a car in Berlin as a U.S. military vehicle not because it was part of an armored convoy snarling traffic for a mile behind it, as in Iraq, but because he spotted the tiny inscription on its license plate: ""U.S. Army.""

""It was written so small,"" he said, still amazed at how inconspicuous it was.

""I'm not defending their presence, but that's not all it was. We have to be honest,"" Kasim told his friend. ""We paid a very high price, but it was the price of freedom.""

Chayan shook his head.

""We haven't seen a bright side,"" he said. ""Well, there's no bright side to colonization, we can say that. But the Americans could have left something positive behind. What makes me sad, wherever I go, whenever I go, I just see remains of destruction.""

A friend of Chayan's stopped by briefly. ""Peace be upon you,"" he said. The two men traded words of endearment in a staccato burst of familiar Arabic: ""My heart,"" ""My dear,"" ""My soul."" Then Chayan bade him goodbye: ""With peace."" His friend's response was distinctly Iraqi, a word borrowed decades ago from English and now used as a greeting, as a farewell, as thanks or as welcome.

""Hello, hello,"" he said.

The British Interlude
The British entered Baghdad in 1917 to end Ottoman rule, with the same pledge the Americans would make. ""Our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators,"" proclaimed Maj. Gen. Sir Stanley Maude. Like the Americans, the British faced a revolt, in 1920, led by a segment of the population that had grown frustrated and resentful at the heavy-handedness of a foreign army.

British rule lasted until 1932, and its waning influence ended with the fall of the Hashemite monarchy in 1958. By then, it had left an indelible mark on Iraq's culture and society. Everything from post offices and nightclubs to the railway stations and double-decker red buses that ran in the capital until the last days of Hussein's rule bore a British stamp. So did the military, the judiciary, the health system and the ministries.

Even today, English instructors in Iraqi universities favor a British accent.

""The British created the system. We inherited it from them,"" said Adnan Pachachi, an 85-year-old lawmaker and former diplomat who entered Iraq's foreign service in the last years of the monarchy. ""Of course, Iraqis then added to it.""

Words borrowed from the British still litter Iraqi Arabic, albeit with a local inflection: glass, bottle, bicycle, rail, battery, ice cream, counter, blanket, jerrycan, gear, dashboard (dishbool), table (tabla) and lousy (malyous). ""Wrongside"" means to drive the wrong way down a one-way street. Some argue that the word for tea glass, istikaan, comes from the phrase ""ice tea can."" (Others insist the word is derived from Persian.)

And, of course, ""hello.""

American Dreams
Abu Naji was the nickname Iraqis gave their British occupiers. There remains no equivalent for the Americans, but a slew of words describe those who imitate them. The older term for someone becoming more American than Americans was mitamrik, or Americanized. More conservative types here call such people khanazeer or quruud, ""pigs"" or ""monkeys."" One student at the Academy of Fine Arts coined another name.

""Am-raqis,"" she said.

The students agreed there has been an infitah, or opening -- the word many use for the plethora of influences that followed the occupation, imported through the Internet and satellite television, each banned to varying degrees under Hussein. But many of them echoed the question heard at the Madarat Gallery: What has freedom brought?

""You can say what you want to say, and you don't care what anyone else thinks,"" said Raed Ibrahim, a 23-year-old painter at the academy. ""That's my freedom. Anyone can grasp it.""

Shahid Shaker, a 21-year-old sculptor, looked at the ground, then spoke up. ""Don't exaggerate,"" she told him softly. ""Yes, the occupation brought freedom. But it destroyed culture, too. We're being educated in a culture of violence.""

""Sometimes,"" she added, ""there is too much freedom.""

Imported pornography is sold openly in Baghdad's Bab al-Sharji market. Popping pills is something of a fad. On campus, dating has grown more permissive. The reality TV show ""American Idol,"" broadcast by a Saudi-owned satellite channel, has its fans. Citing songs by 50 Cent and Metallica conveys a certain hipness. So do tattoos; Shaker says 40 percent of students have one, a remarkable figure given that they were once a mark of prison time.

""I'm going to get one as soon as I get the money,"" Ibrahim volunteered.

'Havee Matel Mark'
Mark Apram, the most popular tattoo artist in Baghdad, charges $50 for his work. Twenty-nine and married, he sometimes works from his cramped apartment, where a wall bears the words ""Havee Matel Mark"" over his painting of a red-eyed devil with pitchfork. (""Did I spell it right?"" he asked.)

The room is a potpourri of American influences: a picture of an FHM model laminated on his coffee table; a stuffed Taz, the Tasmanian devil from Looney Tunes; an Incredible Hulk action figure. His shirt, embossed with images of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, reads, ""The Hood, the Bad and The Guilty.""

""Anything American, I love it,"" he said. ""It's what makes me happy.""

Apram estimates that he has done a million tattoos since the Americans invaded, inspired by the Internet and by designs he saw on soldiers' arms when they rolled up their sleeves. ""Maybe even more,"" he responded to a look of disbelief.

He is an advertisement for his own work. His left arm bears the images of a scorpion, the sun, the Virgin Mary and the name of an old girlfriend, Rana. (His pregnant wife has begged him to remove that one.) Being right-handed, he has left his right arm bare. On his right leg are tattooed a dragon and the letter E, for Eminem.

Butterflies and flowers are most popular with girls, he said. Men prefer skulls, a barbed-wire-like design, Metallica and the names of daughters, wives and girlfriends. Some ask for a dragon. A teenage boy wanted a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

The Internet has been influential, he said, as have satellite TV channels. But as he sees it, his success is a legacy of the presence of tens of thousands of American troops in his country.

""They're the origin of all of it,"" he said. ""They're teaching us how to act.""

A Military Lexicon
The military aesthetic may prove to be this occupation's most lasting cultural artifact. If the British can claim credit for an array of industrial words used by Iraqis, including ""radiator"" and ""machine,"" the Americans are responsible for a military lexicon that is still evolving.

""Hummer"" has entered Iraqi dialect as the word for the armored jeeps known as Humvees, as has the Arabic-inflected plural, Hummer-at. ""Buffalo"" is the word for MRAPs, the hulking Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. ""Chocolate, mister!"" or ""Soccer ball, mister, soccer ball!"" children shout to troops in Sadr City, a Baghdad slum of soggy trash and stagnant pools of sewage.

Badg-at has become Iraqi Arabic for identity cards. Other words and phrases have been picked up from soldiers at checkpoints or conducting house raids or foot patrols: ""Relax,"" ""Please,"" ""Sorry,"" ""No problem,"" ""Oh, my God,"" ""Give me five."" Almost any youth can hurl a string of American expletives whose Arabic equivalent would earn them a slap across the face.

The war has inspired new Arabic words, as well. Hawasim, the name Hussein bestowed on his last battle in 2003, has come to mean booty looted in its aftermath. Arabic rendered literally from English at checkpoints -- ""Prepared to capture criminals"" or ""Prepared to help"" -- reads like the Arabic subtitles of an American movie.

As in the Palestinian territories, where security forces sometimes copy the style of their Israeli occupiers, Iraqi soldiers are now sometimes indistinguishable from their American counterparts, resembling a scaled-down version of a football player.

There is the desert camouflage, along with sunglasses and, occasionally, gloves. The black leather boots of the Hussein era have given way to a khaki suede variety. Holsters have gone from the hip to the thigh. The soldiers are equipped with kneepads, though they usually droop down to their ankles. No one was seen with a flak jacket before the invasion. Nor did anyone roll up their sleeves or tuck their pants into their boots.

Even the posture is American: rifle carried high, finger on the trigger.

And a fist thrust forth has come to mean stop.

""They look like peacocks,"" declared Abu Ali Rubai, a 60-year-old uniform vendor. ""They wear this and that,"" he said, pointing at a holster nicknamed Rambo, combat boots called Swat, and plastic handcuffs. ""They're like a child playing with toys.""

He ruffled through bags filled with the gold-colored insignia of the old army's medical corps, tanks, special forces and artillery. He pointed out the colors of the berets that no one buys anymore -- blue for air force, beige for infantry and red for military police. Then he grabbed fistfuls of new badges, most of them in English and Arabic. There was Special Forces, with its skull and crossed arrows (sometimes written as Special Farces). ""Iraq Army"" was printed in English. So was SWAT. One badge read, ""Ministry of Interiors.""

Rubai cast a longing eye at his favorite uniform, worn by Abdel-Karim Qassem, the officer who overthrew the monarchy in 1958, in a portrait that hangs behind his desk. It was a woolen, British-style uniform with a hat known as the sidara, or faisaliyya. Four blue versions of the hat still hung from nails in the wall, gathering dust.

""The old ones were more distinguished,"" Rubai said. Then he recited a stanza by Maaruf al-Rusafi, a nationalist poet who died in 1945.

The English are not our saviors,

Even if they have made pledges to us in writing.

When has a strong man had pity for the weak?

How does a master make a pledge to his sheep?

We are but prisoners in their hands

And by the pledges they have written that shackle us.

By God, even if we were monkeys,

Monkeys would not accept being our kin."
162,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"There is a hint of an older Baghdad in old Baghdad. You might call it more of a taunt. It's there at the statue of the portly poet Marouf al-Rusafi, pockmarked by bullets, who gives his name to an untamed square. Around him revolves a city, storied but shabby, that American soldiers have finally, ostensibly, left.

The past is here. A turquoise dome, fashioned from brick and adorned in arabesque, peeks from beneath a shroud of dust. A stately colonnade buttresses British-era balconies and balustrades. A forlorn call to prayer drifts from an Ottoman mosque.

But few can see the dome. A spider web of wires delivering sporadic electricity obscures the view. You can't navigate the colonnade. Blast walls block the way. And rarely does the call to prayer filter out from a deluge of car horns.

""It's all become trash, broken windows and crumbling buildings,"" complained Hussein Karim, a porter looking out from his perch atop a flap of cardboard on the statue's granite pedestal. ""Baghdad,"" added his friend, Hussein Abed, ""has become a shattered city.""

U.S. combat troops finished withdrawing from Baghdad and other Iraqi cities on June 30. But they leave behind a capital that is forever altered by their presence. Augustus boasted that he found Rome a city of bricks and made it a city of marble. Baghdad was another city of bricks, and a coterie of American generals turned it into a city of cement. Their concrete is everywhere -- from the sprawling Green Zone to the barriers and blast walls that line almost every street -- reorienting the physical, spiritual and social geography that for more than a millennium was dictated by the lazy bends in the Tigris River.

In time, though, those walls may matter less than the deeper forces that six years of an American presence hastened. Baghdad is now a city divided from itself. Shiite neighborhoods rarely have Sunnis. Sunni ones, far less numerous today, no longer have Shiites. Christians have all but left. Potentates seek refuge in fortresses, and the poor fend for themselves.

From Beirut to Cairo to Baghdad, the Arab world's great capitals have all lost a measure of tolerance, receding behind walls, psychological and otherwise, that demarcate their sects, ethnicities and classes. Each mourns the disappearance of a cosmopolitanism that seemed entrenched a generation ago. Each longs for the inhabitants that gave it more grace. In the end, Baghdad may be the dystopic culmination of those trends, not so much shattered by the present as it is divorced from its history.

The Americans created none of it, but facilitated all of it, giving space to the region's worst impulses.

""Destruction is easy,"" declared Karim, the porter. ""Building takes a lot more time.""

Saddam Hussein brought a coarsely martial style to an earlier Baghdad. To a utilitarian capital, his monuments brought a twisted vainglory.

The Hands of Victory is probably most distinguished in that vision, for its vulgarity alone. Conceived in 1985, the arch of crossed swords celebrated an Iraqi victory at a time when Iran was winning the eight-year war. The fists grasping the swords were molded from Hussein's, enlarged 40 times. The curved blades are replicas of the swords of Saad Ibn Abi Waqas, the Arab general who defeated the Persians in the 7th century. Each required 24 tons of metal, recast from the guns of dead Iraqi solders. From the wrists dangled nets bulging with thousands of bullet-riddled helmets of Iranian soldiers. By one account, the original plan called for Iranian skulls.

The walls of today are more functional, but no less distinguishing. They are without the aggressive permanence of the barriers the Israelis have built to divide themselves from the Palestinians. They lack the political graffiti and inspired art that made the Berlin Wall so distinctive. Instead they articulate the disparate ambitions in an Iraq that is emerging from war, even as many wonder what it has left.

Paintings on the cement boast an idealized Iraq of Sumerian and Babylonian glory or a future of improbable skyscrapers. Vendors use them as billboards -- for real estate, children's clothes and changing money. The government scrawls on them its authoritarian vision of law as an antidote to entrenched disorder. ""Respect and be respected,"" one motto reads. ""Be a hero. Protect Iraq,"" urges another.

""These walls will be removed when the people of Iraq finally wake up again,"" said Wissam Karim, a 28-year-old soldier walking to his base in Adhamiyah.

He glanced at a wall that stretched nearly two miles, dividing the Sunni residents of Adhamiyah from the Shiite residents of Sleikh. ""Long live the resistance,"" read a slogan scrawled on one segment. Someone had crossed out the last word and written ""Iraq.""

Khan Mirjan was built in 1359, and an inscription on a wall of the caravanserai glorifies its founder, Amin al-Din Mirjan: ""The most abundantly just, king of kings of the world."" For 600 years, the building endured as a masterpiece of Islamic architecture.

In the months after the invasion, it was looted. A rising water table soon flooded it. Majestic but musty, the khan feels like the Colosseum might have to a medieval Roman.

""It endured for hundreds of years,"" said Hassan Ibrahim, a 41-year-old squatter or watchman (take your pick). ""If you want to destroy it, it takes no more than minutes.""

Unlike in Cairo or Istanbul, with their imperial cityscapes, remarkably little of Baghdad's antiquity has survived. Wars, the flooding of the temperamental Tigris and occasional lightning made sure of that. The city instead seems to draw pride from a culture of memory.

""When did we lose that civilized spirit?"" asked Saad Owaiz, a 58-year-old denizen of the Zihawi Cafe, with a cigarette-stained goatee and Lenin-style glasses.

He longed for a past as imagined as it was real. He mourned Rashid Street and its long-shuttered restaurants and cinemas. He missed the chatter among officials, sheikhs and men of letters at the Parliament Cafe.

""There's not as much conversation these days,"" he lamented.

The neighborhood that unfurls from Rusafi's statue was once Baghdad's most vibrant, with a mix of Ottoman mosques and markets and British-era apartments. There was fashion on River Street, culture on colonnaded Rashid Street, the first to be illuminated in Iraq. The tastiest pastries, the best coffee and the most delicious ice cream could be found there. Protests got their bearings at the square, then surged forward.

Today there is commerce of another sort, cheap goods disgorging into streets that no longer form intersections; the blast walls make them more a maze. Fish from the Tigris asphyxiate in a tub on a car. A pyramid of soft drinks sweats like its vendor. Girls' dresses splash yellow, orange and pink in a street of gray and brown.

Pictures stare out from the occasional cafes and even more occasional bookstores. King Ghazi's handsome gaze contrasts with King Faisal II's boyish innocence. A prince dons the sidara, a cap forever tied to an era.

In the days of those pictures, Owaiz boasted, he would eat no more than a piece of bread and a slice of cheese, then drink a glass of pomegranate juice from a stand called Hajji Zibala.

""It was like we ate an entire sheep,"" he said. ""Now if we eat an entire sheep, we're still hungry. . . . The mood's just not there.""

""Baghdad,"" he added, ""is like a ghost to me.""

Nostalgia is perhaps the defining sentiment in a disenchanted Arab world, punctuating conversations in Cairo and Beirut as it does in Baghdad. It marks the fact that something -- a measure of tolerance, a more libertine life, the cosmopolitanism of a confident culture -- has been lost.

Beirut had its downtown, before the civil war wrecked it, where families posed before the statue in Martyrs' Square. Now a preserve of the rich, it was once a crossroads of class, where cinemas abutted the fish market, and boutiques and banks shared space with vegetable vendors. Cairo had its downtown -- the Groppi cafe and cinemas such as Rivoli, Metro and Opera -- whose era ended with a fire in 1952 and a revolution that followed.

Not all was wonderful, of course. Cairo was far more pleasurable if you were a foreign resident, sometimes never speaking Arabic, than an Egyptian. Sightseers in Beirut could ignore a ring of misery on its outskirts, populated by disenfranchised Shiites. But few would dispute that identity, be it sect, ethnicity, even class, was more malleably defined. And nearly everyone would agree that chauvinism had yet to best tolerance.

""How do you tell that story without seeming too nostalgic for a world that in many respects we wouldn't want to bring back?"" asked Mark Mazower, author of ""Salonica, City of Ghosts."" ""That's the dilemma.""

To Mazower, the nostalgia is not something singularly Arab, but rather a universal narrative that seems to capture failure as much as it does loss.

""Everybody is conscious of how difficult nation-states find it to establish stable and tolerant regimes,"" he said. ""The nostalgia reflects the sense of their crisis today.""

There is neither stability in postwar Baghdad, nor tolerance. But Maysoon al-Damluji stops short of blaming the American troops who have mostly left her capital.

""I have always said an army is an army, regardless. It's just young men with guns,"" said Damluji, an architect and lawmaker from a prominent family. ""You don't expect an army to take care of a city. You don't expect an army to be sensitive to people's needs.""

Baghdad was immiserated already before the Americans came. There was the eight-year war with Iran, when prisoners of war were paraded in pickup trucks through the city. Sanctions followed another war, Iraq's 1991 invasion of Kuwait, in time wiping out Baghdad's once-vibrant middle class.

""There are whole generations that have grown up who know nothing but the language of war, confrontation and defiance,"" Damluji said. ""You see it in people's eyes.""

Baghdadis -- by which she meant the city's tolerance -- have gone. Migrants from the countryside, with the hard rules of hard men, have taken their place. In her day, a tribal sheik would forgo his headdress when he visited the capital.

""He would be too embarrassed,"" she said. ""When they visited, they acted like Baghdadis. Now people living in Baghdad act like tribal elders from the countryside.""

Damluji has an answer; a project to restore the swath of urban wilderness around Rusafi's statue. Owners would become shareholders in a company that would renovate and resurrect a portion of the city that stretches nearly two miles along the Tigris, from Bab al-Sharji to Bab al-Moadhem. Traffic would be forbidden. Cinemas and stores would share space with parks. Hers is similar to a vision that helped rebuild Beirut, but unlike in the Lebanese capital, she said, ""We are going to try to keep the social fabric and not turn it over to Starbucks.""

She unfurled a photo 20 feet long, a satellite image of the city. There were no barriers, no concrete, no t-walls. ""All this is going to be restored,"" she vowed, waving her hand across the photo.

There is a famous song by Kazem al-Saher, Iraq's best-known singer, about the capital. ""Has God ever created, in the entire world, anything as beautiful as you?"" he asks. His voice then rises, plaintively, as he cries, ""Baghdad! Baghdad! Baghdad!""

Was it ever really beautiful? Damluji paused.

""No,"" she answered. ""No, I don't think Baghdad was ever a beautiful city. But it was a lively city. It was civilized.""

The photo remained at her feet. She dragged on a Davidoff cigarette as her gray terrier, Apricot, jumped into her chair.

""It will take awhile,"" she admitted. ""It's far more difficult to build than to demolish."""
163,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"Louis Khno is a city councilman whose city is beyond his control. In his barricaded streets are militiamen -- in baseball caps and jeans, wielding Kalashnikov rifles, with the safeties switched off. They answer to someone else. Leaders of his police force give their loyalty to their ethnic brethren -- be they Kurd or Arab. Clergy in the town pledge themselves to the former. Khno and his colleagues to the latter.

""We're far from the conflict, but now we've become the heart of the conflict between Kurds and Arabs,"" Khno said. ""We're now stuck in between them.""

Khno called the town ""the line of engagement,"" one stop along an amorphous frontier in northern Iraq shaped by contested history, geography and authority. Dividing the Kurdish autonomous region from the rest of the country, that frontier represents the most combustible fault line in Iraq today, where Arab and Kurd forces may have come to blows last month along hills of harvested wheat. Kurdish officials suggest that another confrontation is inevitable, with halfhearted negotiations already stalled, and U.S. officials acknowledge that only their intervention has prevented bloodshed.

Since 2003, when U.S. forces barreled into Baghdad, toppling Saddam Hussein, inspiring a Shiite revival and unleashing a Sunni insurgency that drew on a communal sense of siege, the war in Iraq has been in large part a sectarian conflict that pitted Sunni Arab against Shiite Arab. That war has subsided, even if bitterness remains.

For months, there were fears that the sectarian battle might reignite, as the United States withdrew its combat forces. Today, that looks less likely. Rather, U.S. officials say, the biggest threat to Iraq in the years ahead is the ethnic conflict, Kurds in the north against the Arab-dominated government in Baghdad, a still-unresolved struggle that has helped shape Iraq's history since the British inherited the land after World War I.

Already, the conflict has redrawn alliances, helping bring a Shiite prime minister into the arms of a powerful Sunni sheik in Anbar province, once the cradle of the insurgency. It has stoked long-standing Kurdish fears of a resurgent government in Baghdad bent on curbing the power of its regional government, which held an election Saturday for a president and new parliament. And it has plunged border towns like Qaraqosh into an increasingly nasty struggle that some fear may end in bloodshed.

""There may not be war. We're tired of wars,"" said Atheel al-Nujaifi, the Sunni Arab governor of northern Iraq's Nineveh province. ""But there will definitely be clashes and fights here and there.""

Animosity in Sunni Anbar
It was not so long ago when talk in Anbar, the sprawling province west of Baghdad, dwelt on lynching Americans, smiting infidels and driving Shiite politicians and their Iranian sponsors from Baghdad. Talk there is anything but subtle.

These days, there is a new refrain.

""The Kurds are most dangerous because they live among us as Iraqi citizens,"" declared Raad al-Alwani, a blunt-speaking sheik in Ramadi whose fondness for scotch competes with his affection for two $20,000 falcons tethered in his front yard. ""They should remember that someday there will be a strong government in Baghdad again.""

""In the old days, one policeman would have kicked all the Kurds out,"" added his cousin, Khalid Abdullah al-Fahad, dragging on a cigarette and sipping tea.

Another cousin, Skander Hussein Mohammed, chimed in.

""Our children will kick them out if we can't,"" he vowed.

With an ear tuned to Iraqi politics, along with the legacies that shape them, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has cultivated those resentments to fashion himself into a nationalist leader. He has staked out an identity as a defender of Iraq's unity and its Arab identity. He has insisted on a strong central government and changes in the constitution that are anathema to Kurds who see that document as their bulwark against an emboldened Baghdad. Since last year, he has dispatched the Iraqi army to the disputed border areas, many of them -- not incidentally -- home to potentially vast reserves of oil and gas.

That has played well in Anbar, where Maliki, a Shiite, has proposed an alliance with Ahmed Abu Risha, perhaps the most powerful Sunni sheik in the province, whose brother led the fight against al-Qaeda in Iraq until he was assassinated in September 2007.

""He's someone who wants a united Iraq,"" Abu Risha said of the prime minister. ""Our points of view, our perspectives are very close.""

To call Iraqi politics transparent is to suggest Abu Risha's Rolex is imitation. It's not. And the parlor game in Baghdad these days is discerning Maliki's true motivations. Is he the nationalist strongman so many here desire, bent on defending the territorial integrity of Iraq from the reach of Kurdish ambitions? Or is he covertly sectarian, trying to stoke Arab fears to distract from his imposition of Shiite hegemony in Baghdad?

In Anbar province, Alwani insisted that Maliki's tough line on the Kurds was a gambit to gather Arab votes for parliamentary elections in January. Another sheik, Hamid al-Hais, praised Maliki's stand on the Kurds but insisted he must be tougher. To the nods of fellow tribesmen, Hais offered his own solution to Kirkuk, a city contested by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens: ""If they try to take it, we wipe it off the face of the map.""

Suspicions Among Kurds
There is a suspicion that colors almost every conversation in the Kurdish autonomous region, a majestic stretch of ranges, interspersed with rivers and fertile valleys. It is fostered by a fight with Baghdad that dates to the British era, and reinforced by the massacres Hussein unleashed at the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988.

""Is their policy of procrastination and delay for the sake of [allowing] them to get stronger to impose their will on us?"" asked Falah Mustafa Bakir, a Kurdish minister.

Maliki has dispatched two delegations to Irbil, the Kurdish capital, ostensibly to break the deadlock in relations between the Baghdad government and the Kurdish government. But he has not spoken with Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish president, in a year, a clear sign that their once amiable relationship has fallen apart.

As one official termed it, ""there's a lot of poison in the air.""

U.S. officials acknowledge that the disputed boundary has become the most pressing issue in a slew of unresolved conflicts in Iraq -- from national reconciliation to an oil law on sharing revenue and managing the country's enormous reserves.

For years, that boundary was known as the Green Line, drawn as Iraqi forces withdrew from northern Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. It served as the border until 2003, when Kurdish forces, known as pesh merga, crossed the frontier with U.S. approval. Since last year, Maliki has pushed back, sending the Iraqi army to confront pesh merga in the border town of Khanaqin, which has a Kurdish majority, and deploying thousands more troops in Kirkuk. Fearing tension, the U.S. military has bolstered its presence in Kirkuk.

For months, though, the U.S. Embassy has abdicated the lead role in resolving the border issue to the United Nations, which has made little headway. Timing is bad, too. These days, Kurdish attentions are focused on the results of Saturday's election for a regional president and parliament, in which opposition parties did surprisingly well. Forming a government may take until September. With the campaign for national elections beginning in November, little time is left for real negotiation.

As in Arab Iraq, some are also suspicious of the motivations involved in fanning the conflict.

""Internal consumption,"" said Muhammad Tofiq, a Kurdish opposition politician. To him, the dispute is a way to divert attention from the corruption and failures of the region's ruling parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party. ""To them, an oil well is more important than Sinjar and Khanaqin,"" two contested cities.

But old suspicions die hard here, as evidenced by a confrontation between Iraqi army and Kurdish forces that probably would have erupted last month in Makhmur, a disputed town controlled by Kurds, had U.S. forces not been present.

A round of late-night calls by the U.S. military and others averted a clash. ""But when will it happen again?"" asked Nechirvan Barzani, the Kurdish prime minister. ""There is still the logic of who is powerful and who is weak.""

Town of Divided Loyalties
The first question at the checkpoint on the edge of Qaraqosh, the Christian town along the disputed border, was standard. ""Where are you coming from?"" barked a militiaman in street clothes, armed and paid by a benefactor loyal to the Kurds.

The questions that followed weren't.

""Are you Christian?"" he asked. ""Are you Kurdish? Are you Arab?""

These days in Qaraqosh, it matters.

Residents seem to resist the idea of being joined to Kurdistan, as the Kurds refer to their autonomous region. Many of the Christians here pronounce a pride in belonging to an ancient community of Mesopotamia. Others resent the heavy-handedness of Kurdish security, which residents say has hauled away scores of people in the past few years to prisons in Irbil and, farther north, in Aqrah.

""When they return,"" one politician said, ""they have to keep their mouth shut.""

Qaraqosh is consumed in a claustrophobic conflict over space and borders, a grinding attempt to lay claim -- politically, psychologically and socially -- to everything from the authority of the police to the rebuilding of a church.

The native language of the deputy police chief is Kurdish. So is his loyalty, critics say. His boss speaks Arabic. Members of the city council pledge loyalty to Gov. Nujaifi's Arab-dominated government in Mosul, which provides Qaraqosh meager water and electricity. More generous is the money that has poured in from a benefactor, Sarkis Aghajan, a wealthy Christian who once served as Kurdish finance minister. Credited to him are buses for students, renovations of orphanages and monasteries, and even generators for electricity. Officials say he is behind the militia, too, which numbers 1,200 fighters in Qaraqosh and two other Christian towns.

""We have an order from the state,"" said Ghadeer Salem, one of the commanders.

Baghdad? he was asked.

""No,"" he replied. ""Kurdistan."""
164,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"There was once a swagger to the scotch-swilling, insurgent-fighting Raed Sabah. He was known as Sheik Raed to his sycophants. Tribesmen who relied on his largess called him the same. So did his fighters, who joined the Americans and helped crush the insurgency in Anbar province.

Sabah still likes his scotch -- Johnnie Walker Black, with Red Bull on the rocks -- but these days, as the Americans withdraw from western Iraq, he has lost his swagger. His neighbors now deride him as an American stooge; they have nicknamed his alley ""The Street of the Lackeys.""

""The Americans left without even saying goodbye. Not one of them,"" Sabah said in his villa in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar, once the cradle of Iraq's insurgency. ""Even when we called them, we got a message that the line had been disconnected.""

Nowhere is the U.S. departure from Iraq more visible than in Anbar, where the 27 bases and outposts less than a year ago have dwindled to three today. Far less money is being spent. Since November, more than two-thirds of combat troops have departed. In their wake is a blend of cynicism and bitterness, frustration and fear among many of the tribal leaders who fought with the troops against the insurgents, a tableau of emotion that may color the American legacy in a region that has stood as the U.S. military's single greatest success in the war.

Pragmatism, the Americans call their departure. Desertion, their erstwhile allies answer.

As the United States leaves the province, acknowledged Col. Matthew Lopez, the Marine commander here, ""you're going to have individuals who are unhappy.""

Sabah freely admits he is one of them.

""We stood by them, we carried out their requests, we let no one hurt them,"" he said in a rushed clump of words, near certificates of appreciation from the Marines and the U.S. Army that gather dust in a mother-of-pearl cabinet. ""They weren't supposed to abandon us.""

As he sat with other tribal leaders who joined the American-led fight in 2006 and 2007, his reticence seemed to rival his fatalism, the sense that foes outnumber friends. ""I expect I'll die at any time,"" he worried. ""Today, tomorrow, maybe the day after.""

'The British Had Foresight'
Steeped in desert traditions of pride, dignity and honor, no one in Anbar, perhaps the most Arab of Iraq's Arab regions, would contend that any foreign occupation was good, and the Americans remain deeply unpopular in some quarters here. But true or not, there is a prevailing sense in this vast, arid region bisected by the Euphrates that, as far as occupations go, the British were better at it than the Americans.

There are bridges still nicknamed ""British bridges,"" built after the British defeated the Ottoman Empire and occupied Iraq at the end of World War I. One spans the Euphrates in Ramadi. The descendants of some sheiks jealously guard pictures of their forefathers posing with British potentates. One of them bragged that Gertrude Bell, the British diplomat and adventurer, wrote about his ancestor, the powerful sheik Ali Sulaiman.

""One of the most remarkable men in Iraq,"" she declared in a letter to her father.

""The British had foresight and, we can't say credibility, but they had more patience than the Americans. They understood how to take time to win someone to their side,"" said his great-grandson, Ali Hatem Sulaiman. ""The Americans, no. With them, it's either shoot you or give you money, it's either hire you or beat you up.""

The Americans, he said, used a jackhammer to shape a diamond.

Deliberate Disengagement
To be fair, Lopez, the colonel in Ramadi, is no jackhammer.

His tenure in Iraq started in 2003 in Karbala, part of the Shiite Muslim heartland. He ends his latest tour, this one in Iraq's Sunni hub, next month. He dismissed the idea that allies were somehow abandoned or friends shown any disrespect.

The day after he took command, Lopez ordered the construction of a diwan, a kind of reception hall requisite in any sheik's house. Forty-eight hours later, it was done, complete with eight Persian carpets, overstuffed furniture, ample ashtrays and even pink plastic flowers in the corner. On the wall is a clock with the 99 names of Allah in Arabic.

""All the nuances,"" Lopez described it, ""all the cultural sensitivities.""

His Marines train their Army successors in the etiquette of brewing Turkish coffee, or as one soldier put it, ""espresso times 10."" Well-sugared tea should be served as soon as the sheiks sit down in Lopez's diwan. ""You want to be Johnny on the spot every time,"" Cpl. Jared Jones insisted. In serving meals, put lamb in the middle, he said, chicken to the side. Take plastic silverware out of the wrapper; doing otherwise is considered tacky.

""We can't stress how much this matters,"" Jones lectured the impromptu class of a half-dozen soldiers. ""We mess it up, we pay the price. Now, are there any questions about chow?""

But even Lopez's efforts can't rewrite the arithmetic of postwar Iraq. He acknowledged that ""the sheer mathematics"" of the withdrawal mean U.S. officers are simply less engaged with some of the sheiks who joined them in the fight against insurgents, a battle widely viewed as one of the crucial pivots in the American experience in Iraq. As he describes it, the military has also disciplined itself to better target which sheiks it wants to court -- the 20 or so whom they have deemed most prominent here.

""I think that's one of our institutional lessons learned,"" Lopez said.

The goal of what he called a responsible drawdown was ""a return to normalcy.""

""It's not normal for a coalition presence to be injected into the Iraqi cultural system and the sheiks' system,"" Lopez said, sitting in his office at Camp Ramadi. ""Without extricating ourselves from the equation,"" he added, ""it can't return to normal.""

A Sheik Speaks His Mind
Postwar Anbar is anything but normal, whatever normal might mean here. By virtue of its money, arms and prestige, the U.S. military -- like its British predecessors -- has indelibly remade the province's landscape. One ally, Ahmed Abu Risha, whose clan was little known before the occupation, is on a trajectory to become Anbar's most powerful man. Other allies have gathered fabulous wealth. Yet others deem themselves dead men walking, having courted too few friends while they occupied the U.S. limelight.

The one constant is the degree to which the sheiks dislike one another. Any pledge not to speak ill about one's peers is almost always a preamble to a string of expletives. In one rant that ended only when the sheik ran out of breath, a rival was called a pimp, a prostitute, the son of a dog and, finally, ""a circumciser.""

Perhaps another constant is the suspicion that many of America's allies direct at their patron.

""They did the same thing in Vietnam,"" said the pragmatic Affan al-Issawi, a U.S.-allied militia leader near Fallujah whom Lopez called ""a very dear friend of mine.""

""I know their history. Just in one night, they left. They left all their agents and friends behind. I knew they would leave one day,"" Issawi said.

Issawi has decorated his villa with portraits of himself with then-President George W. Bush, former American military commanders and President Obama. He acknowledges the help the U.S. military gave him in the counterinsurgency, including rifles, heavy machine guns and ammunition it seized from ""bad people,"" as well as $1.5 million in contracts to build schools and a water station. On one $450,000 school contract, he boasted, flashing a $25,000, diamond-encrusted Rolex watch, he managed to clear $300,000.

Indeed, Issawi may come out on top. He is an ally of Abu Risha, who some speculate might become the president of Iraq after next year's elections. Issawi has a seat on the provincial council, guaranteeing police protection. He carries his wealth naturally, like a rich Persian Gulf Arab, at ease with privilege to which he has grown accustomed.

""I didn't build my life with American bricks,"" said Issawi, who will turn 35 in November. ""I knew one day they would leave, and that they would leave quickly.""

A Bitter Aftertaste
In 1922, Ali Sulaiman, the sheik praised by Gertrude Bell in her letter, worried what would happen to his reputation if it looked like the British had abandoned him.

Nearly a century later, Raed Sabah and a coterie of other sheiks are the modern equivalent. At the peak of the fight against the insurgency, the United States supplied Sabah with 50 AK-47 rifles. Jassem Swaidawi, another ally, ran up a $30,000 bill one month on a U.S.-supplied phone he used to contact the military; he was reimbursed. Hamid al-Hais shows off a partial right finger and two wounds in his right leg, suffered in a fight with insurgents in 2007. They all met Obama when he was still a presidential candidate.

Some of them said they expected American citizenship. Fearful for their lives amid charges of treason, others hoped for help finding residency in neighboring Jordan or Syria. Some are clearly motivated by money, which was once abundant: They want funds to keep flowing in a region that, more than any other part of Iraq, appears wedded to kleptocracy. ""The simplest thing they could have done was to keep in touch,"" said Sabah, who last saw representatives of the U.S. military before the provincial elections in January.

""The Americans never understood Iraqi society,"" added Hais, sitting in his diwan with a plaque from the U.S. military that reads, ""Allies in battle, friends in peace.""

""All they did was write down in their notebooks what they were supposed to have learned,"" he said.

The American project here was always infused with contradictions. Iraq was never as sovereign as U.S. officials insisted, never as secure as the military proclaimed. The United States called itself a partner, even as it presided over the destruction of the country's fabric. In Anbar, it proclaims a return to normalcy, amid a withdrawal it deems responsible, in a land that will long bear its mark.

Sabah and other U.S.-allied sheiks joke darkly about the accusations leveled against them: that they have served as spies and stooges for the Americans. Some call them ""the sheiks of dolma,"" a reference to the stuffed grape leaves the allies would serve U.S. military officers for lunch. You served the Americans, some tell the sheiks, and they never served you.

""The Americans took what they wanted from them and left them behind. You can't do that in Iraq,"" said Col. Mahmoud al-Issawi, Fallujah's police chief. ""It's shameful to the worst degree. It's not just shameful, it's actually a huge scandal.""

""An easy target to be killed,"" he termed the sheiks.

In the interview, Lopez, the Marine commander, said he was sure that the United States would still boast of friends in Anbar in five years. Sabah, not called a sheik as often these days, was doubtful.

""They may have to come back one day, and their friends won't be here anymore,"" he said. ""Who would stand with them again? After this? No one would accept it."""
165,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"The U.S. military called it shock and awe, and it began on March 21, 2003 -- 8:09 p.m., to be exact. It concluded here with a sigh. No one quite remembers when the Americans withdrew from Forward Operating Base Summers.

""One morning they left, and they never came back,"" said Osama Majid, a vendor on the road to the base, as he hovered over his shelves of Iranian and Turkish packaged sweets. ""People woke up, and they were gone.""

Occupations probably never really end. Even after the last of the 115,000 U.S. soldiers leave, this one will live on in the national psyche, in the bearing of Iraq's military, in cowboy boots, tattoos and, of course, language. ""Badjat,"" demand Iraqi sentries at Summers' gates, waiting for a visitor's identity card. Sometimes occupations leave behind the banal.

Summers is like an archaeological dig.

Perched 30 miles southeast of Baghdad, the former U.S. base -- known before the Americans arrived and after they departed as Suwayrah Airport -- often strikes the pose of a post-apocalyptic outcast, the posture of much of the country. The land around it is austere, possessed of beauty only at the gloaming, when loneliness becomes serene. Its outskirts were looted of everything years ago, down to the tan brick that once lined buildings' walls. The compound itself feels forlorn and deserted, the doors of its buildings barricaded by plywood, its windows sealed by cinder block.

Inside those buildings is the swill of American commercial culture, feeling as incongruous as the winter rain that falls on the country's desert these days.

Strewn on concrete platforms where soldiers once lived are cans of Skoal, a package of Orville Redenbacher's Movie Theater Butter Popcorn and a Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookies wrapper. In another room is a Pringles Sour Cream & Onion can, a plastic jar of Herr's cheese snacks and a tin of Chef Boyardee Beefaroni. Scattered nearby are energy drink cans such as Java Monster and Rip It. A pigeon rustles the quiet, past a door where a sign still reads: ""Quiet Hours, 2200-1100, No Exceptions.""

""When people go from a place, from any place, they're going to leave a mess behind,"" said Sgt. Hazem Said, with the tiny Iraqi 2nd Company that inherited the base.

At times, America's withdrawal from Iraq appears as mundane as its invasion was climactic. At the peak of the U.S. military buildup in Iraq in 2007, there were more than 160,000 troops. Today, there are 115,000, and many of those who have left often departed seemingly in stealth. By August, only 50,000 are supposed to remain.

From the once-proud city of Baghdad, they have withdrawn through a landscape that bears the scars of the battles they fought and witnessed, where the echoes of occupation still sound along the road in the grunts of anarchy and the whispers of abandonment. Everything seems bent and broken, torn and tangled, from the railing on the highway to the signs bearing names of faraway destinations to the rubble piling up along the curbside. At least those curbs are not yet crumbling.

Coiled barbed wire has kept its sheen but lost its purpose. Only the trunks remain of palm trees cut to deprive insurgents of cover. Withering, their replacements evoke a pessimism about their chances. Everything around them seems khaki, the color of war.

At the end of the road from Baghdad, in southernmost Umm Qasr, with its port facing the Persian Gulf, military convoys ply a road whose asphalt, melted in the sun, bears the deep grooves of years of vehicle tracks. Carrying Humvees, generators, fuel and forklifts, the trucks keep a precise distance over an imprecise landscape, passing knots of Iraqi soldiers dressed in mismatched camouflage at untidy checkpoints.

Not everything goes with them.

At the former FOB Summers, the sandbags stay behind. So does the generator, even though a fuel shortage has kept it from working this week. A red stop sign rendered in English remains at the gate. As do the graffiti. ""USAF -- Death on Call,"" one reads. Basketball hoops still stand, without their nets. ""No dunking,"" warn signs on two of them. Scattered under one hoop is a ""Quick Start Guide"" for an armored vehicle known as an MRAP. ""For official use only,"" it says. Nearby are discarded letters from home, gathering dust.

""Dear Soldier,"" one embossed with a smiley face reads, ""words are not enough to express my thanks for your self-less service. God bless America and God bless you.""

In the commander's office, flimsy walls are still adorned in Hello Kitty wallpaper (purple and pink). On the floor is a box from Iowa that once held hamburgers and hot dogs. An unused U.S. Postal Service envelope promises to deliver anywhere in the United States.

And, of course, the concrete barricades are still here, everywhere.

""They left us the walls,"" said Sgt. Ahmed Hussein, manning the gate.

He looked around. ""It reminds me of a prison,"" he said. ""They put concrete around you and lock a gate. What else would you think?"""
166,WP,Anthony Shadid,2010,Iraq US Exit,"Recitation of the Koran, mournful but consoling, played from a scratchy cassette as the men gathered in the funeral tent for condolences. They sipped bitter Arabic coffee, only enough to leave an aftertaste. As they smoked cigarettes, an American helicopter rumbled overhead, its rotors sounding the familiar drumbeat of war.

The men had arrived on this day in June 2003 to pay their respects to Hashim Mohammed Aani, a chubby 15-year-old who was one of three people killed a day before in a U.S. raid through this lush region on the sweep of the Tigris River.

An omen, a soft-spoken former judge called the shy boy's death. Other mourners called it a tragedy. To the rest of Iraq, it was little more than a statistic, incidental in the killing fields the country would soon be reduced to. The raid itself was a footnote.

This is the story of that footnote, a cautionary tale in the Iraq war. It is the story of the raid's unintended consequences -- a chain of events that began as soon as American troops set foot in Thuluyah. As the U.S. military departs Iraq, those events have brought the town full circle, returning it to where it was when Saddam Hussein fell.

Drawing on dozens of interviews and numerous visits since 2003, some chronicled in The Washington Post, it is the story of a town where wild thorns grow among the unadorned tombstones. It begins with a tall, burly 28-year-old who served as an informer for the Americans on that raid. His name was Sabah Kerbul, and the mourners who gathered the next day blamed him for the deaths.

'Like an earthquake'
Perched on a bend in the Tigris, Thuluyah had escaped the ravages of the U.S.-led invasion that March. A 90-minute drive north of Baghdad, the town was beyond the route of the U.S. military, which was bent on occupying Baghdad. Although Thuluyah's men had filled the ranks of the Baath Party, the army and the intelligence, the town was too small to figure in most maps.

Within weeks, though, it would bear the scars of the invasion's confusing aftermath. Eleven days after Saddam Hussein's regime fell that April, one of the first insurgent attacks occurred at the edge of town, along an irrigation canal that over time was nicknamed the Valley of Death. More followed. By June, in response, the U.S. military had devised Operation Peninsula Strike, dispatching helicopter gunships, armored vehicles and edgy troops in the first attempt to quell an insurgency that would only grow more intense.

They arrived in Thuluyah after midnight.

""It was like an earthquake,"" recalled Mawlud Awad al-Jabbouri, a tall and stocky resident who had served as a brigadier in Hussein's intelligence service.

The soldiers shouted in English. Most of the residents stared back in frightened incomprehension. Like others, Jabbouri raised a white handkerchief, in a universal sign of surrender. With hundreds of others, he was blindfolded, bound with plastic cuffs and forced to lie on his stomach. Helpless, he listened as his wife and five children cried nearby.

""I was afraid they were going to line us up on the wall and shoot us as revenge,"" he said. Lying next to him was his cousin, Saad Salah Ali, short and balding.

""What do you do?"" an interpreter barked at Ali. ""I'm a taxi driver,"" he replied.

From somewhere near, Ali heard another voice. The Arabic was spoken in the town's own dialect. It was familiar, that of a neighbor, someone who lived a few houses away. ""Oh, you're a taxi driver,"" the voice said sarcastically to Ali, a former colonel.

It was Sabah. Others noticed him, too, as he ambled through the crowd in American-issued desert camouflage and pointed out suspected insurgents.

The soldiers soon departed the town, but they left behind myriad grievances articulated in cries for vengeance. No one could do anything about the Americans -- not yet, at least. But they could do something about Sabah.

As in other Sunni regions, the sway of tribes had grown in Thuluyah after Hussein's fall, and their authority and the code that underpinned it bore a desert inflection, austere and merciless. The dead 15-year-old had been a member of one tribe, Sabah was from another, and justice had to be done. And the sheiks, empowered in the anarchy of 2003, their words now law, would mete out their notion of it: Either Sabah's family must kill Sabah, or the sheiks would kill the family.

""The sheiks insisted,"" Sabah's brother said. ""Everyone said he must be killed.""

A man named Nadhim Khalil, better known as Mullah Nadhim, was the lone figure to speak out on behalf of Sabah's brother and father. Khalil, the son and grandson of clerics and the head of the Caliphs Mosque, the town's largest, was sympathetic to their pleas. No one had proven Sabah was a traitor, the cleric said. Even worse, he suspected, some of the sheiks were trying to cover up their own collaboration with the Americans by making Sabah a scapegoat. He agreed to meet Sabah the next day.

""But the Kalashnikov was faster than I was,"" Khalil lamented.

The sheiks had said they would wait no longer, and the next morning, two hours before the call to prayer, Sabah's brother and father led Sabah behind the house.

""Seconds before he died, I told him it's not us. It's the town, and we're just one house, alone. We're standing all alone,"" the brother recalled, his lips quivering.

Five shots later, Sabah was dead.

A curse, Khalil called it, and he denounced it three days later at the mosque.

""His killing opened the door to hell,"" he recalled. ""It didn't only open it, it broke it down, and it couldn't be closed again.""

A new, chaotic reality
The residents of Thuluyah take pride in their origins, their blue eyes testament to their ancestors' flight centuries ago from neighboring Syria. When they arrived, the latticework of canals and branches of the Tigris reminded them of ribs -- the origin of Thuluyah's name in Arabic. Their town would be the heart those ribs protected.

Customs were entrenched. No one could ask a favor of a sheik unless they first spent three days at his home. Lunch for a stranger, any stranger, was requisite.

The sheiks inherited the town in 2003. After Hussein's government fell, there was no one else.

But in the months that followed Sabah's death, those same sheiks were overwhelmed by the dynamics the invasion had set in motion. In that, Thuluyah was a microcosm of the region once known as the Sunni Triangle, populated by poor Sunnis of the countryside with whom Hussein had identified. He had courted them as a pillar of his rule. He had guaranteed their interests and provided them patronage.

Now he had fallen. The village was left to fend for itself against ascendant Shiites and an aggressive occupation that brought U.S. military patrols in Humvees through the town almost every day.

""A ball of string, and nobody knew where it started"" was how Abdel-Hamid Shweish, one of the town's two preeminent sheiks, described the new reality.

Khalil, the cleric, was blunter. ""It was a tsunami,"" he recalled.

Khalil, though only 25 at the time, had already led the family's mosque for seven years, and his words assumed more importance as Sunnis turned to religion to reinforce their identity. He saw no end to the occupation. Sectarian strife was mounting. Sunnis here needed a militia to defend their interests.

In October 2004, the first cell of al-Qaeda in Iraq came together. The insurgent group was homegrown but led by foreigners. Only nine people from Thuluyah were members. By 2006, when Khalil said he joined, he estimated that al-Qaeda in Iraq had 500 Thuluyah residents among its ranks.

The group wrapped itself in the rhetoric of faith and fatherland: It would defend the people's dignity against the American occupiers and the Shiites doing their bidding. But its real success relied on a tactic borrowed from organized crime: It adhered to no limits in using violence.

In all, more than 200 townspeople were killed as collaborators. Occasionally, their bodies were doused with gasoline and burned. Insurgents talked of shutting down schools, which they denounced as an instrument of occupation. They ordered women married to policemen to divorce their husbands. It didn't matter. By then, most of the police officers had resigned.

Before sunset, U.S. patrols would venture from their base at a former airfield known as Abu Hleij, renamed Forward Operating Base McKenzie, more worried for themselves than the town several miles away.

""After sunset, life stopped,"" said Jabbouri, the former brigadier in the Iraqi intelligence service.

Not even the sheiks felt safe. One of them, Hussein Ali Saleh, stationed 10 armed men to guard his house. Another was ambushed, bullets tearing through his leg. He still limps. Grenades were thrown twice at the home of Shweish, who recalled that Thuluyah at the time was a ""battlefield."" The sheiks received pictures of their meetings with Americans in 2003, as both threat and blackmail. Insurgents soon seized the traditional place of the sheiks in arbitrating disputes.

""The sheiks had no power whatsoever,"" Jabbouri said. ""They could do nothing but fear for their lives.""

Then, in 2007, a blurry picture began to make the rounds in Thuluyah.

The tide turns in Thuluyah
The men in Thuluyah have come to hold on to pictures like artifacts, as a way to remember what was. They are not family portraits. They are gory, chronicling the trail of blood that al-Qaeda in Iraq charted during its reign in Thuluyah. Men cling to them in macabre fascination, shocked at how grotesque the violence grew.

One showed what was left of a traffic policeman. In September 2007, armed men killed him, then impaled his head on a metal stake they had driven into the ground at the entrance to the Ishaq Bridge. For four days, as sand from the banks of the Tigris hung in the air like a windblown fog, it stayed there. His family was too afraid to take it down.

""It was not humane, it was not religious, it was not resistance,"" said Safa Saleh, a resident of the town. He shook his head, recalling the image. ""It was something so ugly.""

Soon after, Saleh's brother Ibrahim was killed. It was Ramadan, Islam's most sacred month. Saleh was riding with his brother and other relatives in their olive Opel when a gray Opel cut them off. Saleh's brother, a police lieutenant, was kidnapped. After three days of negotiations, and a ransom that included a $1,000 Glock 9mm, his brother's body was returned to him. The hands were bound with electric wire. There were burns to the legs and genitals. In a photo, his head is gone, as if animals had torn it from his body, dragging away parts of his spine with it.

It had been three years of jihad, a time when residents often tacitly accepted killings of people whom al-Qaeda in Iraq deemed collaborators and spies, he said. ""But now this?""

""Ibrahim was loved, his morals were good, and he was respected. When he was killed, everyone knew they could no longer stand for it,"" he recalled. ""It moved the entire town to act against the armed men. The ugliness created a revolution inside people.""

In a matter of weeks, residents stopped providing shelter to militants. They pleaded for police officers to return to their jobs, offering tips on the whereabouts of insurgents. One of the town's sheiks, whose home was attacked with mortar shells and whose nephew was kidnapped and killed, set up a checkpoint with his own armed men, contesting al-Qaeda in Iraq's control of the streets.

Most importantly, Khalil, the cleric, had turned against the insurgents, denouncing them from his mosque.

After years of fighting, Khalil had come to realize that the insurgency was failing to protect the interests of the Sunni community. Even now, he defends al-Qaeda in Iraq's ideology. ""A good project,"" he said. But in practice, it had only managed to turn sentiments against him and his notion of jihad.

Khalil soon emerged as a leader of an American-backed militia of former fighters, helping cripple the group with intelligence that only a convert could provide. A year later, only a dozen or so of al-Qaeda in Iraq's fighters remained in the town, the rest vanquished by police, Khalil's men and the U.S. military, whose soldiers had become a more common sight at the police station and town hall.

""We had entered a dark tunnel with no light at the end,"" the cleric said. He nodded, contrite but confident. ""The choice that we had made didn't bear fruit.""

A cleric's rise and fall
By 2008, Khalil was a man about town.

Crowds spilled outside the doors of his family's mosque, enraptured by his thunderous sermons. He led the council that oversaw the hundreds of armed men who were members of the U.S.-backed militia, and he headed a group of local tribal leaders formed by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Khalil was anything but bashful in recommending himself as a possible candidate for parliament. The simple mention of his name, Mullah Nadhim, ensured passage through the numerous checkpoints created in the fight against al-Qaeda in Iraq.

Then Iraqi security forces arrested him in May 2009 on charges he criticized as political. The Americans had once embraced Khalil. Now, in the words of a military spokesman, they considered his arrest ""a matter for the government of Iraq."" In public, Maliki called for Khalil's release. In private, one of Maliki's senior aides said the prime minister had once asked Khalil how many people he had killed while he was a leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Four months would pass before Khalil was freed from a prison in Tikrit.

Celebratory gunfire greeted him as a 12-vehicle convoy of politicians, officers and tribal leaders, sirens blaring, escorted him home on Sept. 18. His enemies, watched by his allies with a wary eye, joined hundreds of others at his manicured villa to pay their respects. But as Thuluyah's fruit trees began losing their leaves, it was clear Khalil no longer commanded the authority he once did.

""Mullah who?"" a soldier at a checkpoint asked at the outskirts of town when queried by a reporter.

On a recent Friday, Khalil walked a dirt path that, by his count, he has plied more than a thousand times. In tan sandals and a traditional white robe, a cleric's turban wrapped around his head, he passed ripening pomegranates and bullet holes etched in cement, their edges rounded by time. ""Long live Iraq,"" a faded slogan read on a wall.

Khalil said he no longer had ambitions for parliament. In disgust, he had hid in a drawer a picture of himself with a grinning U.S. soldier. Reluctantly, he seemed to acknowledge his own rise and fall. ""If we talk about a strongman these days,"" he admitted, ""there is none.""

But at 31, he appeared relaxed, even playful, as he neared the crowded mosque with a retinue of bodyguards, having ended what he described as a mujazafa, a word that can mean adventure or risk.

""Order,"" he admitted, ""has brought an end to the law of the jungle.""

Order meant the power of the sheiks, he added, ""and that cannot be changed.""

Back to normal, sort of
Near Thuluyah's elegant villas, the fuchsia blossoms of the Mirabilis jalapa sometimes grow wild. They are known as the 4 o'clock flower, renowned for their ability to stay underground, lost to any garden for so long that they are eventually forgotten, only to sprout again when conditions change.

These days, one of the plants is blossoming near the house of Shweish, the leading sheik.

""These six years are like a rain cloud that arrives in summer,"" he said. Shweish spoke slowly, with a quiet sense of authority that comes with the expectation of being obeyed. ""It comes, and just as quickly, it's gone.""

Saleh, the other preeminent sheik, these days receives guests not with a retinue of 10 guards but with a prepared speech that he gingerly holds in hands furrowed like drought-stricken land.

""Iraqis are brothers from north to the south, from east to west,"" he declares.

In a less formal moment, the 82-year-old boasted that he and his colleagues have again seized the authority over matters of life and death. ""Right now, praise God, we have the first word again in Thuluyah,"" he said.

Shweish put it more bluntly. ""I am where I started,"" he said.

A footnote to the war, as incidental as it was forgettable, wrecked and remade Thuluyah. Hundreds were killed, farms turned to desert. ""Thuluyah's suffering was part of Iraq's suffering,"" Khalil lamented. ""Our reality is its reality."" As the Americans leave, the men gathered for lunch at the house of Jabbouri, the former brigadier, and wondered at the recent past.

""We should blame ourselves,"" said Ali, Jabbouri's cousin, who had heard Sabah's voice during the U.S. raid. ""We have to take responsibility for the spark that we ignited.""

""Actually it was our fault,"" Jabbouri added. ""We were the problem.""

""Why do we blame ourselves?"" Ali went on. ""Because we clapped our hands in the beginning. We brought these people to us.""
Bathed in an afternoon sun, the room turned silent.

The war never had to happen, he meant.

""Everything has its price,"" he said, ""but as a town, we paid a very high price.""

The past remains alive
There is a story often recounted in the most traditional stretches of Iraq, where the unforgiving ways of the desert hold sway. In one telling, a Bedouin's father was killed, and a vendetta followed. Forty years had passed, and the Bedouin had yet to exact his revenge.

Why, he was asked.

""Laisa baad,"" he replied. Not yet.

Near the citrus groves and fields of wheat and vegetables where he killed his son six years ago, before ferrying the corpse to the cemetery a mile away in a pickup truck, Sabah's father recalled the execution with anger.

""What happened has happened,"" he said. His eyes were steely, his body taut. ""I don't want to turn back the pages of the past.""

Son Salah intervened, apologizing.

""Forgive my father,"" he said. ""He is very angry at the past.""

Salah walked to the dirt road outside. His hands shook, and his body trembled. Unshaven, with the sinewy build of a day laborer, he nervously smoked Kent cigarettes.

""He is my brother,"" he blurted out, ""from my flesh, from my blood.""

After Sabah's death, the father and brother, both of whom fired the shots that killed Sabah, fled the town. They would not return for three years.

""This was the injustice of Thuluyah and its sheiks,"" Salah said.

A crime, he called it.

His brother's grave lies down a road that meanders outside town, past parched irrigation canals, denuded orchards and olive trees coated with dust. The cemetery is washed of color. There is no shade to give respite from the sun. Save for the wind and the sound of distant cars, it is quiet, making the place feel even lonelier.

Only three broken bricks scarred white by bird droppings mark the grave, a rough pile of riverine gravel, mud and straw. Scrub brush, bearing thorns, grows nearby.

""We still haven't put the tombstone,"" Salah said softly. ""We haven't had time.""

He stood with his hands clasped tightly behind his back, one balled in a fist."
167,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System,"Mikhail Beketov had been warned, but would not stop writing. About dubious land deals. Crooked loans. Under-the-table hush money. All evidence, he argued in his newspaper, of rampant corruption in this Moscow suburb.

“Last spring, I called for the resignation of the city’s leadership,” Mr. Beketov said in one of his final editorials. “A few days later, my automobile was blown up. What is next for me?”

Not long after, he was savagely beaten outside his home and left to bleed in the snow. His fingers were bashed, and three later had to be amputated, as if his assailants had sought to make sure that he would never write another word. He lost a leg. Now 52, he is in a wheelchair, his brain so damaged that he cannot utter a simple sentence.

The police promised a thorough investigation, but barely looked up from their desks. Surveillance videos were ignored. Neighbors were not interviewed. Information about politicians’ displeasure with Mr. Beketov was deemed “unconfirmed,” according to interviews with officials and residents.

Prosecutors, who had repeatedly rejected Mr. Beketov’s pleas for protection, took over the case, but did not seem to accomplish much more. Mr. Beketov’s close colleagues said they were eager to offer insights about who in the government had been stung by his exposés. But no one asked.

Eighteen months later, there have been no arrests.

In retrospect, the violence was an omen, beginning a wave of unsolved attacks and official harassment against journalists, human rights activists and opposition politicians around the region, which includes the Moscow suburbs, but not the city itself. Rarely, if ever, is anyone held responsible.

One editor was beaten in front of his home, and the assailants seized only copies of his articles and other material for the next day’s issue, not his wallet or cellphone. Local officials insisted that he sustained his injuries while drunk.

Another journalist was pummeled by plainclothes police officers after a demonstration. It was all captured on video. Even so, the police released a statement saying that he had hurt himself when he was accidentally pushed by the crowd.

These types of attacks or other means of intimidation, including aggressive efforts by prosecutors to shut down news media outlets or nonprofit groups, serve as an unnerving deterrent. And in a few cases in recent years, the violence in the country has escalated into contract killings. Corruption is widespread in Russia, and government often functions poorly. But most journalists and nonprofit groups shy away from delving deeply into these problems.

The culture of impunity in Russia represents the most glaring example of the country’s inability to establish real laws in the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union. And this failure radiates throughout society, touching upon ordinary men and women who are trying to carve out lives in the new Russia, but are wary of questioning authority.

Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, has bemoaned the country’s “legal nihilism.” Yet under Mr. Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, it has persisted. And among the major beneficiaries have been the governing party’s politicians.

Threats, Then a Beating
Boris Gromov, the governor of the Moscow region, commanded the 40th Army during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and his opponents believe that he governs with a general’s sense of order. Mr. Gromov, appointed by Mr. Putin, has in turn seeded local government with fellow Afghanistan veterans, including the Khimki mayor, Vladimir Strelchenko.

Mikhail Beketov often referred to Mr. Gromov and Mr. Strelchenko as “army boots,” and did not think much of their honesty.

Mr. Beketov was brawny like a boxer, fast-talking, perpetually late and prone to latching onto causes. He himself had been an officer in the army paratroops, but then switched to journalism, working as a war correspondent in Afghanistan and Chechnya. His experiences left him with a distaste for overbearing military officials.

He established his newspaper, Khimkinskaya Pravda (Khimki Truth), in 2006. He wrote regularly about what he considered corruption among local officials, who were often members of Mr. Putin’s governing party, United Russia.

He financed the newspaper himself. It had a circulation of only about 10,000 copies, but it garnered a large following in Khimki, which has a population of 185,000, and the surrounding cities, especially after Mr. Beketov grabbed hold of two topics.

His articles resonated nationally when he questioned why the city had demolished a monument that contained the remains of Soviet fighter pilots. The work was done to widen a road.

And he relentlessly focused on the fate of the Khimki forest, a pristine expanse of old-growth oaks and wild animals, including elk and boars, improbably close to Moscow. With little public notice, the government had planned to build a major highway to St. Petersburg through the forest. Mr. Beketov suspected that officials were secretly profiting from the project.

Local officials, unaccustomed to such criticism, lashed out publicly. Privately, Mr. Beketov received phone threats. He asked the authorities for help, but was rebuffed, his colleagues said. He returned home one day to discover his dog dead on his doorstep. Then his car was blown up.

Instead of investigating the explosion, prosecutors opened a criminal inquiry into his newspaper. His friends said that Mr. Beketov told them that one city official had warned him about his articles.

But he did not relent. “You can imagine what kind of money the authorities plan to fleece from this so-called infrastructure,” he wrote about the highway plan.

“For four years, I have observed our authorities,” he said. “I have closely interacted with many senior officials, including Strelchenko himself. Given how the authorities have collected scandals with frightening regularity, I have come to a regrettable conclusion: They are shameless.”

On a November evening in 2008, Mr. Beketov was assaulted, most likely by several people, outside his home. He was discovered by a neighbor the next day.

Even as Mr. Beketov later lay in a coma at the hospital, he was not safe. A threat was phoned in: We will finish him off.

Journalists have been attacked in a region along the M-10 highway.

His friends and colleagues grew so alarmed that they moved him out of the Khimki hospital to a better, more secure one in neighboring Moscow.

Both the police and prosecutors found the case tough to crack.

Yuliya Zhukova, a spokeswoman in the Moscow region for the investigative committee of the prosecutor general’s office, said the office had conducted a thorough inquiry, but ultimately had to suspend it for lack of evidence. She said that investigators needed to interview Mr. Beketov to make progress, but that his doctors would not allow that. (Mr. Beketov has been unable to communicate since the attack.)

Yevgenia Chirikova, a leader of a local environmental group who worked closely with Mr. Beketov on his articles about the highway, said that she was eager to help, but that investigators did not contact her.

“I waited and waited and waited,” Ms. Chirikova said. “I knew that according to the rules, they are supposed to question those closest to the victim.”

She said she decided to approach the investigators herself. They questioned her for several hours, asking her about her motivations for getting involved in the case, she said.

Ms. Zhukova criticized allies of Mr. Beketov and some journalists for assuming that the attack was related to Mr. Beketov’s work.

“Very often, unfortunately, they have presented erroneous information, and misled people regarding the course of the investigation,” she said.

Governor Gromov and Mayor Strelchenko declined to be interviewed for this article. After the attack, Mr. Strelchenko said he had played no role in it, but also complained that it was getting too much attention.

“I don’t want to say that it was good what happened to Mikhail,” he said. “But I want you to separate truth from untruth.”

Attacks on Two Editors
To the north on the M-10 highway from Khimki is a city called Solnechnogorsk, where a newspaper, Solnechnogorsk Forum, was publishing exposés about how local politicians were seeking to do away with elections to maintain power.

Yuri Grachev, Editor of Solnechnogorsk Forum.

The newspaper’s editor, Yuri Grachev, is 73. In February 2009, several men assaulted him as he left his home, putting him in intensive care for a month with a severe concussion, a broken nose and other wounds.

Police officials first said he was drunk and fell down. Then they said he had been the victim of a random robbery, though all that was taken was a folder with material for the newspaper’s next issue. The muggers have not been found, and politicians from the governing party, United Russia, said the attack had nothing to do with Mr. Grachev’s work.

“Maybe it was hooligans or maybe it was by chance,” said Nikolai Bozhko, the local party leader, who is also an Afghanistan war veteran. “The idea that it was ordered — I don’t believe that.”

Prosecutors had better luck finding evidence that Solnechnogorsk Forum had committed libel. They have brought charges against the paper, aiming to shut it down.

“The system will stop at nothing to break you,” Mr. Grachev said.

Farther up the M-10 Highway is Klin, where an opposition rally was held in March 2009 to protest corruption and increases in utility rates.

As Pyotr Lipatov, editor of an opposition newspaper called Consensus and Truth, was leaving the rally, three men pushed him to the ground and punched him repeatedly on the head. “Even when I was unconscious, they didn’t let me go,” Mr. Lipatov said.

This beating was recorded on video by protesters. Mr. Lipatov’s colleagues used the video to track down the men who beat him. They were police officers.

While Mr. Lipatov, 28, was recovering in the hospital, he said two other police officers visited and urged him to sign a statement saying that he had provoked the attack. He refused. The police then issued a statement.

“According to Lipatov, filming the meeting with his camera, he found himself in the middle of a reactionary crowd, was pushed and fell to the ground,” the statement said. Two videos of the demonstration show a different sequence of events.

Officials later acknowledged that police officers had been involved in the attack, but they still brought no charges. Instead, they raided Mr. Lipatov’s offices, seized computers and brought a criminal extremism suit against him. They asserted that he had sought to foment “negative stereotypes and negative images of members of the security forces.”

Fearing for his safety and more criminal charges, he quit.

“Everyone was against me — the judges, the police, the prosecutors, everyone,” he said. “I took over Consensus and Truth because I supported Prime Minister Putin’s call to fight corruption. But look what happened. The machine here did everything possible to defeat us.”

Promises, but No Arrests

After the attacks in Khimki, Solnechnogorsk, Klin and elsewhere, the authorities, apparently concerned that the region had developed a reputation as a danger zone for journalists, vowed to protect them.

“Attacks on journalists, naturally, create a special resonance,” Governor Gromov’s office said. “The regional government believes that every case of an attack on journalists must be thoroughly investigated.” Even so, no arrests have been made in any of the cases.

And the harassment has not let up.

On March 31, The New York Times interviewed Ms. Zhukova, the spokeswoman for the investigators, about Mr. Lipatov. The next day, investigators approached him in the central market of Klin and said they urgently wanted to question him about the beating, he said.

The session lasted more than six hours. Mr. Lipatov said they tried to pressure him to sign a statement saying that he had wanted to lead a mob to storm city buildings, thereby justifying the police beating. He said he declined to do so.

Back in Khimki, a new opposition newspaper, Khimki Our Home, was established to help continue Mr. Beketov’s work.

The editor, Igor Belousov, 50, is a deeply religious man. He publishes the Russian Orthodox calendar in his newspaper. Before turning to journalism, he was a senior city official, but he resigned because of what he described as pervasive corruption.

Not long after the publication got started, Mr. Belousov was accused of criminal libel by prosecutors and civil libel by Mayor Strelchenko. In February, the police, without any notice, arrested him on charges of selling cocaine. Court documents show that the case is based exclusively on the testimony of a drug dealer from another city who could not recall basic details of the alleged crime.

“We used to have so many journalists here, but they have all suffered and have all given up,” Mr. Belousov said. “Only I remained, and now I am giving up.”"
168,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System,"Only one spectator showed up for the final hearing in the killing of Magomed Yevloyev. He was a broad-beamed, ruddy-faced man in a carefully pressed black suit, and once in the courtroom he removed his tall fur hat, set it on the bench beside him and waited for a chance to speak.

Sunlight streamed in the window, bouncing off the white walls, but the old man had brought a heaviness with him into the room. When the time came, Yakhya Yevloyev stood and recited a litany of evidence not gathered — witnesses not interviewed, threads left dangling — that might have led to a murder conviction in his son’s death.

The room went silent out of respect for the man’s loss, and for a moment it seemed as if the process could rewind 18 months to the beginning, when his son, an opposition leader in the southern republic of Ingushetia, was hustled into a police car and shot through the head at point-blank range.

Back then, in August 2008, it was a crime so outrageous that it seemed to demand action. Magomed Yevloyev was openly feuding with the region’s leader, Murat M. Zyazikov, when the two men happened to board the same flight from Moscow. Barely half an hour after the police escorted Mr. Yevloyev, 36, off the plane, he was dropped off at a hospital with an execution-style wound.

Death is often murky in the violent borderland of the Russian north Caucasus, but this one seemed different. Protests broke out in Ingushetia, and Western leaders pressed Moscow to punish those responsible. Even the Kremlin appeared to feel the political pressure: within two months, President Dmitri A. Medvedev removed both Mr. Zyazikov and his interior minister.

Almost two years later, the case serves as a lesson in how the legal process can be strangled. In Russia, the prosecutor has long served as the guard dog of the powerful. Peter the Great envisioned the office as “the czar’s eye,” and Stalin forged it into a brutal instrument of control.

Though post-Soviet reforms pared away that power, prosecutors still come under direct political pressure and rarely turn their scrutiny upward. In this case, federal investigators reporting to Moscow took over and blocked any inquiry that could have pointed to senior officials.

Yakhya urged investigators to pursue the case as a murder, but an examination of the legal records shows that possibility was not explored. Instead, the state opened a case of negligent homicide, a mild charge used in medical malpractice cases, and prosecutors requested a sentence of two years. By comparison, defendants can receive five-year sentences for distributing pirated software.

The official explanation of what happened took shape an hour and five minutes after Magomed Yevloyev died on a hospital bed. His death, investigators wrote, resulted from a bizarre accident.

‘Point Blank’
When Magomed Yevloyev arrived at the hospital that day, he was in a so-called deep coma — unresponsive to touch, sound or light — and a doctor measured his blood pressure at zero. A coroner pronounced him dead at 2:55 p.m., describing the gunshot wound to his head, canting slightly upward through his right parietal lobe, as “point blank.”

At 4 p.m., an investigator in the regional prosecutor’s office opened a negligent homicide case, stating that Mr. Yevloyev was being transported for questioning in a bombing case when he tried to wrestle a Kalashnikov rifle from the officer to his right. The investigator had not spoken to the three officers who were in the car — he had just read statements provided by the Ingush Interior Ministry — and his explanation raised more questions than it answered.

“Measures were taken to suppress that attempt,” he wrote, “during the course of which Mr. Yevloyev received a gunshot wound from an accidental shot from a police weapon.”

This story was fleshed out over the next two weeks, but there were problems with it. The suspect, Ibragim D. Yevloyev (he shared a common surname with the victim, but they were not relatives), was not an officer who would normally transport a witness, but a guard for Ingushetia’s interior minister, who was at the airport to greet the president. And beginning with his first interview, at 4:25 p.m. that day, he was at a loss to explain how the accident had happened.

At a crime-scene re-enactment 13 days later, the suspect told forensic experts from the prosecutor’s office that he had not pulled the trigger. He said he had been aiming a 9-millimeter Stechkin pistol out of a window to his left, anticipating an attack by armed supporters of Magomed Yevloyev. When he wheeled around toward the two men grappling over the Kalashnikov, he said, Mr. Yevloyev reared back and hit the Stechkin, causing it to fire.

If investigators checked for Mr. Yevloyev’s fingerprints on the Kalashnikov, they never presented any evidence of it. And if Mr. Yevloyev reared his head back and hit the gun, it is not clear how the bullet hit him on the flat side of the head, an inch above his left ear. But a transcript of the crime-scene re-enactment shows the forensic experts did not press the matter:

Specialist Osenchugova: “Could your gun have possibly touched the head of the victim when you made that sudden turn?”

Ibragim Yevloyev: “The gun shot when I turned because of the fight. I can’t show exactly how it happened, it happened very quickly.”

Specialist Osenchugova: “Do you remember if the victim’s head, perhaps, leaned toward a headrest, or, maybe, bowed down?”

Ibragim Yevloyev: “I can’t explain the details.”

“Later,” the transcript reads, “the suspect was asked to show with a laser pointer the trajectory of the gunshot. The suspect refused to do it, saying that for him the difference between a laser pointer and a real gun was fundamental.”

At that point, the prosecution experts took the laser and re-enacted the gunshot themselves. The investigator asked if anyone had questions, but no one did. Asked whether the officer’s account was plausible, Specialist Osenchugova said she considered it “possible not to rule out this mechanism of injury.”

And with that, the re-enactment was over.

A Political Enemy
Yakhya Yevloyev, 67, did not expect prosecutors to represent his interests. Under Russian law, victims hire their own counsel to cross-examine witnesses and testify in court. This gives them a formal voice, but not an equal one. In this case, Yakhya and his lawyers were alone in arguing that his son had been murdered.

There was no shortage of evidence that Magomed Yevloyev was viewed as a political enemy. After several years as a bare-knuckled assistant prosecutor — he left the job after he was accused of participating in a prisoner’s murder — Mr. Yevloyev founded the Web site Ingushetiya.ru, which criticized Mr. Zyazikov and rallied its readers to protest. After filing criminal cases against the site on extremism charges, prosecutors in June 2008 won a decision to close it. The site’s top editor applied for political asylum in France.

During the flight to Ingushetia from Moscow, Mr. Yevloyev and Mr. Zyazikov had found themselves in close quarters for the first time in years. A few weeks later, Mr. Zyazikov told a reporter from Ren TV, a Russian television channel, that he did not even know that Mr. Yevloyev was on the plane with him that day and had no idea who killed him. But Yakhya’s lawyers said their history raised the question of whether the men had a confrontation, and whether the president made the call that set the detention in motion.

Yakhya’s team also had a stroke of luck: a police investigator came forward to say he had been ordered to falsify testimony. Jambulat K. Shankhoyev had authorized police officers to bring Magomed in for questioning that day — but, Mr. Shankhoyev acknowledged, he later discovered that he had been asked to do so after Mr. Yevloyev was already in the police car. “I understood I had been set up,” the investigator wrote in a statement to Ingushetia’s president and prosecutor. When the investigator confronted his superiors about this, he wrote, he was told to keep quiet.

Nevertheless, investigators rejected motions filed by Yakhya’s lawyers one after another. They offered circular logic: If the preliminary investigation pointed to an accident, what legal basis was there for gathering evidence for a murder case?

So there would be no deposition of Mr. Zyazikov, or of passengers on the airplane who might have seen the two men interact, or of Mr. Shankhoyev, the investigator charging a cover-up. Police phone records would not be subpoenaed to trace the officers’ conversations with officials before and after the killing. Yakhya’s lawyers would not be allowed to be present during a crime scene re-enactment, leaving them powerless to point out its weaknesses.

Yuri N. Turygin, the regional prosecutor in Ingushetia, said he prayed Magomed Yevloyev would survive the gunshot wound, aware of the turmoil that would result if he died. Yet he suggested that Mr. Yevloyev, with his history of defiance, probably provoked his captors as he was being driven to police headquarters, knowing that some of his supporters were in pursuit.

“In my view, what caused his behavior was his character,” Mr. Turygin said in an interview. “He is a former prosecutor, he enjoyed some authority, and that dictated his behavior. It was probably within the framework of the law, but it was on the edge of an insult. He could humiliate a police officer — he could say, ‘They are running after you, and when they catch up with you, they will show you.’ ”

It was Mr. Turygin’s office that initially opened an investigation into negligent homicide. The case was taken out of his hands a day later, when it was transferred to the federal investigative committee, based in Moscow. In any case, Mr. Turygin said that if Yakhya Yevloyev had a compelling argument that a murder charge should have been pursued, the judges had leeway to send the case back to the prosecutor.

“The court did not consider it convincing and didn’t return the case,” Mr. Turygin said. “It’s the court’s assessment. I cannot criticize the judges’ actions.”

In response to detailed questions from The New York Times, a spokesman for the federal investigative committee wrote that legal analysis of the evidence was “not within the authority of investigative organs,” and suggested that questions be directed to judges.

Magomed S. Daurbekov, the chairman of Ingushetia’s Council of Judges, said the blame should fall on investigators, because judges were constrained by the evidence they compiled. He said the case should have been opened as a murder case and downgraded later if the evidence supported only a lesser charge, a procedure that might have reassured the victims that a full investigation had taken place. (In the United States, prosecutors usually bring the highest charges they believe the evidence will support, and judges, as in Russia, cannot revise them upward.)

In any case, Mr. Daurbekov said, it was out of the judges’ hands.

“It is not possible to say, ‘Why did the investigator do it this way?’ ” he said. “We cannot give our opinions on those matters. All we can say in this conversation is that it is on the conscience of those who investigated the case.”

A Final Hearing
In December 2009, Ibragim Yevloyev was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to two years in a prison colony. Yakhya appealed, and by March, when the case reached the Ingush Supreme Court in Magas, the capital, he was the last person hanging on the result. He stepped out into the hallway, nerves strung tight, when the three justices began deliberating.

He believed in the law. Conservative by nature, he had ordered his firebrand son to give up opposition activities. After his death, unnamed “friends of the deceased” publicly declared a blood feud against 13 officials, but Yakhya said he argued strenuously against it, rejecting a tradition that courses powerfully through the Caucasus. He repeated his answer like a prayer: Let the state punish them.

This was the last chance. In the brilliant light of the Supreme Court, he begged the judges to send the case back to the prosecutors on the basis of its flaws. Indeed the judges had identified a flaw, but it was not one that he expected. As he sat in stunned silence, the judges announced that prosecutors had overcharged Ibragim Yevloyev, and reduced his sentence from two years in a prison camp to two years’ house arrest.

So that was that. When one judge — an acquaintance from his hometown — crossed the room to touch Yakhya on the shoulder, he stalked wordlessly out onto the street and into a waiting car. His dignity seemed trampled.

“What happened here, I couldn’t have foreseen it,” he said later, when the words came. “It was a mockery, not only of me, but of all those who believed in the fulfillment of the law. It was a demonstration that the law can be bent.

“You can do whatever you want,” he said. “Steal, murder, kidnap. Whatever you want.”

The more radical voices in his son’s circle said Yakhya had been foolish to look to the courts for vindication in the first place. Magomed Khazbiyev, 30, one of the opposition leaders waiting at the airport on the day Magomed Yevloyev was killed, glinted with anger on the day of the decision.

“The judicial system in Ingushetia doesn’t exist now, and it never did,” Mr. Khazbiyev said. “Officially, yes, there is some judicial process. But the blood feud — whether or not there is Russian law, whether Russia exists, even if Russia disappears, or the whole outside world disappears — the blood feud in Ingushetia will exist until the last Ingush dies.”

There is no indication that Moscow wanted the case handled differently. Mr. Zyazikov — a retired lieutenant general in the Federal Security Service — works in Moscow now. When he was removed as Ingushetia’s president, he became an adviser to President Medvedev. (He refused, through a spokesman, to answer questions from The New York Times for this article.) His former interior minister has also had a soft landing, and is now working as a senior investigator for the Russian Interior Ministry. Through an intermediary, he also declined to comment.

The policeman, Ibragim Yevloyev, remains under house arrest, though his lawyer says he is still a target in a blood feud, and reluctant to step outside for fear of being shot.

But in the end, none of these men will make the final decision on how to define justice in this incendiary part of Russia. That choice arches into the future — someday falling to Magomed Yevloyev’s impish, dark-haired children, who will eventually have to decide whether to put their faith in the state.

They are still in elementary school, and do not see much of their father’s old allies from the opposition. Their mother hopes to protect them from the politics and violence that swallowed up her husband. As far as they know, their father died in a car accident."
169,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System,"On the edge of this Siberian village is a resort with a veiled guest list and armed guards at the front gate. When local officials have expressed unease about what goes on inside, the reply has always been the same: do not interfere.

Two and half years ago, the village’s mayor, Tatyana Kazakova, had enough. A major construction project at the resort had exposed a hot water main, threatening the heating supply for the entire village as temperatures plunged to 30 degrees below zero.

Ms. Kazakova was not a typical bureaucrat. She was one of the most successful businesswomen in this vast region, a real-estate magnate with a blond ponytail who represented a new breed of Russian entrepreneur.

She filed a lawsuit against the resort, and asked the regional prosecutor to open a criminal inquiry.

A criminal inquiry was indeed opened — against Ms. Kazakova.

The resort belongs to the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., and the F.S.B. arrested her and had her prosecuted.

She is now on trial in a case that has already become a disquieting example of the power of the security agency in today’s Russia.

More than 25 agents have delved into every aspect of Ms. Kazakova’s life, carrying out what they have termed a “counterintelligence operation.” Masked special service officers with automatic weapons have raided her associates’ homes. More than 250 witnesses have been interrogated, and 67 volumes of evidence have been amassed, according to the trial records.

Even a prominent Kremlin official has declared that Ms. Kazakova is being persecuted, and so has the human rights ombudsman here in Siberia, who is a government official. Yet the F.S.B. remains largely untouchable.

“Why are they doing this, who fears me?” Ms. Kazakova, 47, asked in a letter that she passed to her lawyers last year. “Why are they keeping me in jail, when I pose no threat?”

The F.S.B., which protects national security and investigates major felonies, has never publicly explained why it decided to devote such resources to pursuing the mayor of a village of 1,700 people. She was charged with abuse of office and election irregularities, crimes that the F.S.B. rarely scrutinizes at the local level.

After her arrest in March 2008, she was held in a cell at Pre-Trial Detention Center No. 1, a jail in the Siberian regional capital of Irkutsk that was once used by Stalin’s secret police. For nearly two and a half years, she was denied all contact with her fiancé, mother and three children, including a 15-year-old daughter who has a neurological disease.

Late on Wednesday night, after The New York Times made repeated inquiries to the F.S.B. about the charges against Ms. Kazakova, the judge in the case reversed previous decisions and agreed to release Ms. Kazakova on bail. The next day, Ms. Kazakova embraced her family for the first time since 2008.

The judge is expected to issue a verdict in Ms. Kazakova’s trial within the next few weeks. Her lawyers say, based on how the trial was conducted, that the judge does not seem open to the possibility that Ms. Kazakova is not guilty. She could face several years in prison.

Russia is a freer society than its Soviet predecessor, and the F.S.B. is smaller and less intrusive than the K.G.B. But the agency still functions mostly in secret, with an intimidating reputation and almost no oversight from other branches of government.

Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, the country’s paramount leader, is a former director of the F.S.B. and a former K.G.B. officer, and since his rise to power a decade ago, the agency has wielded tremendous influence in government and industry. Mr. Putin has appointed many former agency officers to senior positions. They are known as the siloviki, from the Russian word for “force.”

The agency has regularly faced criticism for undertaking politically motivated inquiries, especially those involving opposition politicians. It has also prosecuted scientists and academics for what it has contended were illegal transfers of classified information abroad.

And now, the Kremlin seems bent on making the F.S.B. even stronger. Parliament, controlled by Mr. Putin’s party, is in the process of approving legislation that would allow F.S.B. agents to warn people that their activities were “unacceptable” and leading toward a crime. The K.G.B. once employed a similar practice against Soviet dissidents.

The F.S.B. would not comment on Ms. Kazakova. Regional prosecutors said her arrest had nothing to do with the security agency’s resort. But they could not explain why in many other municipal corruption cases in the region, the F.S.B. was not involved, and defendants were treated far more leniently.

“There are laws in Russia, but the security services are beyond any laws,” said one of Ms. Kazakova’s lawyers, Dmitri Dmitriyev. “They act with total impunity. They can undertake special inquiries, collect information on people, violate fundamental human rights, put people in prison, keep them there as long as they want, manipulate judges and manipulate prosecutors. This case is just a demonstration of all this.”

Ms. Kazakova’s longtime companion, Dmitri Matveyev, 40, who had lived with her for years, wanted to marry her after her arrest, but the judge in the case would not allow it. After Mr. Matveyev gave an interview to The Times, he said he was visited by two F.S.B. agents, who instructed him not to speak to The Times again.

“I told them that I am not going to listen to them,” Mr. Matveyev said. “It has been two and a half years, and that has been a long enough period of silence. That is why I am going to talk.”

Getting Things Done
Ms. Kazakova made her fortune operating hotels and markets in Irkutsk, earning praise for her savvy all the way to the Kremlin. She then turned her attention to Listvyanka, a downtrodden fishing village on Lake Baikal, an environmental masterpiece that by some estimates has 20 percent of the world’s fresh water.

She built a hotel here, and after her election as mayor in 2006, promised to spur an economic revival. She planned a major vacation complex, called Baikal City, and even proposed building a residence for the Russian president.

She prided herself on getting things done, but her political opponents called her headstrong and domineering. Her family said she spent more than a million dollars of her own money building a municipal government headquarters for Listvyanka and modernizing utilities and other services. Those figures could not be confirmed independently. Still, the revival of the village was widely praised around Siberia by leaders of Mr. Putin’s governing party, and residents said the changes were notable.

“I am sorry to say that before, we didn’t even have toilets,” said Igor Skripkin, 72, a retired basketball coach. “Now, we have hotels and workplaces. It is all because of her.”

When the F.S.B. resort, which is also a rehabilitation center, began renovations and expansion, it would not divulge its plans to local officials. It said the work was being done under an “antiterrorism program” and thus had to be kept secret, according to court records.

After construction exposed the hot water main, Ms. Kazakova contacted the resort’s director, an F.S.B. colonel named Valery Trifonov, but he dismissed her concerns and told her that she had no right to involve herself in the resort’s activities.

Though the resort appeared to eventually take efforts not to damage the water main, Ms. Kazakova complained that two major fires there had also threatened her village. And she took her most provocative step, appealing to the regional prosecutor in February 2008 to investigate. In her complaint, she said the resort never received permits from the village for its projects, and frequently violated safety rules.

She accused Colonel Trifonov of “threatening the lives of not only those who vacation at the resort and its workers, but also the lives of those people who reside in Listvyanka.” She even sent a complaint about Colonel Trifonov to F.S.B. headquarters in Moscow.

The next month, Ms. Kazakova was arrested by a squad of F.S.B. agents at the regional airport after returning from a business trip to China.

The F.S.B., in conjunction with the regional prosecutor, accused Ms. Kazakova of fraudulently awarding a $120,000 contract for utilities maintenance to a company that Ms. Kazakova secretly controlled, and said the work was never done.

“The fact that she really did something for Listvyanka, thank God for that,” said Vladimir Salovarov, a regional spokesman for the investigative committee of the Russian prosecutor general’s office. “Let her keep doing this. But there is another side to this. You shouldn’t break the law.”

Asked whether the case was related to the F.S.B. resort, he said, “That is absolute garbage.”

Two of Ms. Kazakova’s trial lawyers, Aleksandr Gliskov and Ilya Shcherbakov, said the allegations were fabricated. They said the utilities contract was delayed because of typical weather-related and bureaucratic problems. They pointed out that the company, Kommunalshik, had returned the $120,000 to the village budget even before the charges were brought.

Kommunalshik’s founder, Irina Mikhailova, denied that Ms. Kazakova had rigged the bidding or had anything to do with the company. Ms. Mikhailova said she was arrested by the F.S.B. and transferred in an unheated railway car to a jail 400 miles away. She was held for nine months while the authorities pressured her to corroborate the charges against Ms. Kazakova, she said.

She said investigators threatened to send her to Kolyma, which is 2,000 miles away and was once notorious for its gulags, if she did not cooperate. “They said I would rot in jail,” she said, but she refused to cooperate.

Without Ms. Mikhailova’s help, prosecutors relied mainly on two former Kommunalshik employees, who testified that Ms. Kazakova had a financial interest in the company. Ms. Kazakova’s lawyers described the former employees as disgruntled.

The F.S.B. also scrutinized the village election two years before, which Ms. Kazakova won, 618 votes to 541. She was accused of illegally registering 136 people who did not live in the village.

There are no records left from the election, so prosecutors acknowledged in court that they did not know whether any of the 136 people actually voted. Nor have they presented testimony that these people had been asked to register personally by Ms. Kazakova.

While election fraud is rampant in Russia, the F.S.B. has not typically devoted its resources to investigating electoral malfeasance even in more prominent districts or races.

The agency’s investigation of Ms. Kazakova seemed so unusual that when its regional head, Maj. Gen. Sergei Staritsyn, held a rare news conference, journalists peppered him with questions about it. Two asked why the F.S.B. was involved in such a “trivial” case.

“Your question demonstrates a deformed attitude toward such types of crimes,” General Staritsyn said. “Such facts must not be perceived as trivial.”

Kept From Her Family
In Russia, the authorities wield strict control over the conditions of suspects in pretrial detention, including when to approve medical care and visits by family members. Often, this power is used as a weapon to obtain confessions or to weaken suspects so that they cannot mount a defense in court.

For nearly two and a half years — from her arrest in 2008 to her release on bail on Thursday — Ms. Kazakova had been barred from seeing her three children, mother and fiancé in jail. The judge in the case, Yekaterina Maslova, and prosecutors would not allow it.

Ms. Kazakova’s youngest child, Darya, 15, was apart from her for so long that in recent months, she could barely remember her mother’s voice. “When I come home, it’s so empty without her,” Darya said in an interview in May. “I miss her so much. I want to sit next to her, to hug her and to kiss her.”

The law enforcement authorities had also barred Darya from leaving the country to receive crucial medical care. She has neurofibromatosis, an inherited neurological disorder that is not curable and causes noncancerous tumors to appear throughout the body. Local doctors had recommended that she go abroad.

Ms. Kazakova’s mother, Olga Falomeyeva, 74, burst into tears when she recounted the many times her requests for jail visits had been rejected. She salved her grief by harvesting vegetables in her backyard garden and preparing Ms. Kazakova’s favorite dishes, which she sent to her behind bars. In her rulings, the judge had said that because Ms. Kazakova’s oldest daughter, Olga Kazakova, could be called as a witness, permitting any relatives to see Tatyana Kazakova “could influence the course of the judicial process in the criminal case and could affect the determination of truth in this case.”

The issue of pretrial punishment has drawn widespread attention in Russia in recent months after scandals surrounding two defendants who died in custody in Moscow. One of them, Sergei Magnitsky, was ensnared in a tax fraud case, and investigators sought unsuccessfully to get him to testify against his client, a London-based fund, Hermitage Capital Management, that was once a major investor in Russia.

After those two deaths, Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, called for better treatment of defendants accused of nonviolent economic crimes. But the authorities in Irkutsk did not relent until Wednesday, only after receiving questions from The Times.

Last month, before the judge’s decision to grant Ms. Kazakova’s bail, Mr. Salovarov, the spokesman for the investigators, was asked about the family’s assertion that visiting rights had been denied for nearly two and a half years. He said the family was lying.

“The accusation that we have not granted permission for visits for relatives, it is absolute nonsense,” he said.

But Mr. Salovarov was directly contradicted by documents from the jail itself. A Kremlin official, Pavel Astakhov, the federal children’s ombudsman, has also supported the family. Mr. Astakhov has called the treatment of Ms. Kazakova a “major injustice.”

“I just don’t understand how this can be reasonable in this particular case,” Mr. Astakhov said in a letter to the chairman of the regional court system.

The regional human rights ombudsman, Ivan Zelent, has said that Ms. Kazakova has grounds for filing an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.

Once, in the spring, prosecutors did agree to allow Ms. Kazakova’s mother and Darya to attend her trial. But when they arrived at court, the judge was taken aback. “Who is that?” the judge asked of the prosecutors. When told that it was Ms. Kazakova’s mother and daughter, the judge demanded that they be removed.

Ms. Kazakova, who was being held in a large cell in the courtroom, as is customary for criminal defendants at trials in Russia, cried, “Momma! Momma! Take off your coat and sit down!” The judge ordered Ms. Kazakova to be silent. And her mother and daughter were escorted out."
170,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System,"One day last fall, a police officer here put on his uniform and sat on a drab tan couch before a video camera. In a halting monotone, he recorded two video appeals to Vladimir V. Putin, 13 minutes in all.

He was a nobody cop from a nowhere city, but his words would startle this country.

“How can a police officer accept bribes?” the officer asked. “Do you understand where our society is heading?

“You talk about reducing corruption,” he said. “You say that it should not be just a crime, that it should be immoral. But it is not like that. I told my boss that the police are corrupt. And he told me that it cannot be done away with.

“I am not afraid of quitting. I will tell you my name. I am Dymovsky, Aleksei Aleksandrovich.”

The videos were uploaded to YouTube in November, and a nation that has grown increasingly infuriated by police wrongdoing could not take its eyes off them.

Here, finally, was an insider acknowledging the enveloping culture of corruption in Russia’s police forces — the payoffs large and small, the illegal arrests to extort money, the police chiefs who buy fancy cars and mansions on modest state salaries.

The videos have been watched more than two million times, giving Mr. Dymovsky a kind of fame in Russia similar to that of the police whistleblower Frank Serpico, who in the 1970s spoke out against police corruption in New York City.

But despite the attention, Mr. Putin, the prime minister, has spurned him. So has Mr. Putin’s protégé, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, though Mr. Medvedev has conceded that police corruption has reached shameful levels. And local authorities quickly retaliated against the officer.

Mr. Dymovsky, 32, was immediately fired from his job here in Novorossiysk, a port on the Black Sea, 750 miles south of Moscow. The police interrogated him, his relatives and his close friends, and raided their homes.

During one search of Mr. Dymovsky’s apartment, investigators tried to plant drugs, according to his wife, who was nearly nine months pregnant at the time.

In January, they arrested him and charged him with abuse of office and fraud under a law governing state secrets. The crime they alleged: embezzling $800 in petty cash from the department over several years.

In jail, Mr. Dymovsky was isolated, and prosecutors sought to subject him to a lengthy psychiatric examination. But with the affair proving an embarrassment, he was released after six weeks, and the charges were eventually dropped.

Still, the chief of the Novorossiysk police and a high-ranking officer sued Mr. Dymovsky for slander, and a judge ordered him to pay the equivalent of $3,500 in damages.

International research organizations rank Russia as having the world’s most corrupt large economy, in part because of bribery linked to law enforcement personnel. But senior Russian officials have long seemed to view the loyalty of police officers as more important than their integrity.

And the authorities appeared to do nothing to correct the abuses that Mr. Dymovsky publicized.

The Interior Ministry, which oversees the police nationwide, denied Mr. Dymovsky’s charges. All was in order, the ministry said, with the Novorossiysk police force.

Mr. Dymovsky’s Internet appeals have been imitated by other Russians who are despondent about official malfeasance and believe that they have no other outlet for their views because the state-controlled media whitewashes these problems.

But the Kremlin is seeking to curtail this trend, at least among the police. Parliament, controlled by Mr. Putin’s party, this month toughened penalties for officers who criticize their superiors. It is being called the “Dymovsky law.”

Making Ends Meet
Mr. Dymovsky admits that his own hands are not clean. According to his personnel records, he had a promising career as a police officer, with commendations and promotions. Even so, he said in an interview, he took bribes.

As a major, he was paid only about $450 a month. He said that the authorities know that on such low salaries, officers must find other ways to make ends meet.

He insisted that he accepted only small bribes, never more than $20 at a time. But this was his point: Corruption is endemic.

“The system, from your first day at work, requires you to go out and obtain bribes,” he said. “How else are you going to survive?”

Mr. Dymovsky also described a practice that is considered common in Russia: When officers end their shifts, they have to turn over a portion of their bribes to the so-called cashier, a senior member of the department. Typically, $25 to $100 a day.

If officers do not pay up, they are disciplined.

Mr. Dymovsky said that by 2007, he had become so demoralized that he pledged to himself that he would never again accept a bribe.

Around the same time, he tried to speak with Mr. Putin on his annual call-in television show, during which he responds to complaints and questions from Russians. Mr. Putin was president then.

Mr. Dymovsky said he had called and informed the operator that he hoped to ask Mr. Putin what he was doing about the “lawlessness and corruption” among the police.

He was kept off the air, and later found out that his call had been traced. The Interior Ministry in Moscow alerted his department, and he was reprimanded at several meetings. He was told that a letter had been drafted under his name, in which he would deny having called.

“I realized how this system of covering each other’s backs worked, and that it was not just restricted to Novorossiysk, but reached as far as the Kremlin,” Mr. Dymovsky said.

He decided to record the videos after months of tension.

Mr. Dymovsky said he was upset that his superiors did not care that he had suffered a work-related injury to his arm. (Mr. Dymovsky devoted part of his appeals to denouncing workplace conditions for the police.)

In person these days, Mr. Dymovsky is far more relaxed than the stiff officer in the videos. Tall, with light red hair and a slightly mischievous laugh, he has become a confident public speaker, and seems to enjoy — if not crave — the spotlight.

Luxury on $25,000 a Year
In Novorossiysk, Mr. Dymovsky offered a tour of what he maintained were among the most dispiriting symbols of corruption: the luxury homes of the police brass.

The main stop was the spacious beachfront home where the head of the department, Chief Vladimir Chernositov, lives.

The building, with a conspicuous light blue roof, is on the Black Sea, some of the most expensive real estate in Russia, valued at roughly $800,000 an acre, according to advertisements.

Chief Chernositov has not denied that the home is his, but has never publicly explained how he can afford it. A police chief’s salary for a city like Novorossiysk, which has 225,000 people, is typically about $25,000 annually, experts said.

One of Chief Chernositov’s deputies, Vladimir Grebenyuk, said in an interview that the department was offended by Mr. Dymovsky’s video appeals.

He said Mr. Dymovsky had been an average, though not disgruntled, employee.

Deputy Chief Grebenyuk said that after the videos were publicized, a special committee examined Mr. Dymovsky’s accusations.

“Not a single fact presented by Dymovsky was confirmed,” Deputy Chief Grebenyuk said. “Everything he said was false and invented.”

“You know, our system, the system of the Interior Ministry, is very transparent,” he said.

Asked how many members of the department had been punished for corruption recently, he said the number was tiny. But he would not provide any details.

A Backlash Felt in Moscow
Those who have helped Mr. Dymovsky or demanded a wholesale revamping of the police have also come under pressure.

In Novorossiysk, a human rights activist named Vadim Karastelyov was jailed for a week for distributing leaflets asking residents to attend a rally for Mr. Dymovsky. After Mr. Karastelyov was released, he was savagely beaten by two strangers who did not try to rob him.

Mr. Karastelyov had been receiving anonymous threats by phone and text message, but the police would not provide him with protection. He recently fled Novorossiysk with his family.

“The police leaders want everyone to forget about Dymovsky, so they can continue to doing what they have been doing — committing corrupt acts and fabricating cases against innocent people,” Mr. Karastelyov said.

The backlash extended to Moscow.

A few weeks after Mr. Dymovsky’s video appeals, a senior member of Parliament from Mr. Putin’s own party, Andrei Makarov, declared that the police were so corrupt nationwide that the entire Interior Ministry should be abolished.

Mr. Makarov was disavowed by his party.

“When I made that statement, believe me, for several days, no one knew what would happen to me,” Mr. Makarov said in an interview. “It was as if, ‘How dare he!’ What happened was that I was talking about the people who have the real power in this country.”

Mr. Makarov said he was not a fan of Mr. Dymovsky, expressing doubts about Mr. Dymovsky’s honesty. But Mr. Makarov said reform was desperately needed.

Reform Plan Stalls
He said the government should dismiss half of the country’s 1.2 million police officers and establish a system to fairly adjudicate complaints about the police.

President Medvedev has proposed reducing the number of officers by 20 percent, but there are already indications that his reform proposal has stalled.

“Police officers know for sure that nobody will hold them accountable if a crime is not solved, but they will be held accountable if they allow a demonstration to occur,” Mr. Makarov said. “They will not be held accountable for putting an innocent person in jail or beating one on the street, but they will be if somebody takes a stand against the authorities.”

Mr. Dymovsky said the only real answer is for Russians to create a grass-roots anticorruption movement. Since his release from jail, he has been traveling around the country, trying to rally support for new policies.

But he is still apparently considered a danger.

Recently, he went to Novosibirsk, Russia’s third-largest city, to attend a protest. He said he was accosted by four plainclothes police officers, who told him that if he ever wanted to see his family again, he should leave and never return."
171,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System," It was late one afternoon in January when a squad of plainclothes police officers arrived at the headquarters of a prominent environmental group here. They brushed past the staff with barely a word and instead set upon the computers before carting them away. Taken were files that chronicled a generation’s worth of efforts to protect the Siberian wilderness.

The group, Baikal Environmental Wave, was organizing protests against Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to reopen a paper factory that had polluted nearby Lake Baikal, a natural wonder that by some estimates holds 20 percent of the world’s fresh water.

Instead, the group fell victim to one of the authorities’ newest tactics for quelling dissent: confiscating computers under the pretext of searching for pirated Microsoft software.

Across Russia, the security services have carried out dozens of similar raids against outspoken advocacy groups or opposition newspapers in recent years. Security officials say the inquiries reflect their concern about software piracy, which is rampant in Russia. Yet they rarely if ever carry out raids against advocacy groups or news organizations that back the government.

As the ploy grows common, the authorities are receiving key assistance from an unexpected partner: Microsoft itself. In politically tinged inquiries across Russia, lawyers retained by Microsoft have staunchly backed the police.

Interviews and a review of law enforcement documents show that in recent cases, Microsoft lawyers made statements describing the company as a victim and arguing that criminal charges should be pursued.

The lawyers rebuffed pleas by accused journalists and advocacy groups, including Baikal Wave, to refrain from working with the authorities. Baikal Wave, in fact, said it had purchased and installed legal Microsoft software specifically to deny the authorities an excuse to raid them. The group later asked Microsoft for help in fending off the police. “Microsoft did not want to help us, which would have been the right thing to do,” said Marina Rikhvanova, a Baikal Environmental Wave co-chairwoman and one of Russia’s best-known environmentalists. “They said these issues had to be handled by the security services.”

Microsoft executives in Moscow and at the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., asserted that they did not initiate the inquiries and that they took part in them only because they were required to do so under Russian law.

After The New York Times presented its reporting to senior Microsoft officials, the company responded that it planned to tighten its oversight of its legal affairs in Russia. Human rights organizations in Russia have been pressing Microsoft to do so for months. The Moscow Helsinki Group sent a letter to Microsoft this year saying that the company was complicit in “the persecution of civil society activists.”

Tough Ethical Choices
Microsoft, like many American technology giants doing business in authoritarian countries, is often faced with ethical choices over government directives to help suppress dissent. In China, Microsoft has complied with censorship rules in operating its Web search service, preventing Chinese users from easily accessing banned information. Its archrival Google stopped following censorship regulations there, and scaled back its operations inside China’s Internet firewall.

In Russia, leaders of advocacy groups and newspapers subjected to antipiracy raids said Microsoft was cooperating with the authorities because the company feared jeopardizing its business in the country. They said Microsoft needed to issue a categorical public statement disavowing these tactics and pledging to never cooperate in such cases.

Microsoft has not done that, but has promised to review its policies in Russia.

“We take the concerns that have been raised very seriously,” Kevin Kutz, director of public affairs for Microsoft, said in a statement. Mr. Kutz said the company would ensure that its lawyers had “more clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities.”

“We have to protect our products from piracy, but we also have a commitment to respect fundamental human rights,” he said. “Microsoft antipiracy efforts are designed to honor both objectives, but we are open to feedback on what we can do to improve in that regard.”

Microsoft emphasized that it encouraged law enforcement agencies worldwide to investigate producers and suppliers of illegal software rather than consumers. Even so, it has not publicly criticized raids against small Russian advocacy groups.

With pirated software prevalent in this country, it is not surprising that some of these groups might have some on their computers. Yet the issue, then, is why the police choose to focus on these particular targets — and whether they falsify evidence to make the charges more serious.

Microsoft also says it has a program in Russia to provide free and low-cost software to newspapers and advocacy groups so that they are in compliance with the law.

But the review of these cases indicates that the security services often seize computers whether or not they contain illegal software. The police immediately filed reports saying they had discovered such programs, before even examining the computers in detail. The police claims have in numerous instances been successfully discredited by defendants when the cases go before judges.

Given the suspicions that these investigations are politically motivated, the police and prosecutors have turned to Microsoft to lend weight to their cases. In southwestern Russia, the Interior Ministry declared in an official document that its investigation of a human rights advocate for software piracy was begun “based on an application” from a lawyer for Microsoft.

In another city, Samara, the police seized computers from two opposition newspapers, with the support of a different Microsoft lawyer. “Without the participation of Microsoft, these criminal cases against human rights defenders and journalists would simply not be able to occur,” said the editor of the newspapers, Sergey Kurt-Adzhiyev.

The plainclothes officers who descended upon the Baikal Wave headquarters said they were from the division that investigated commercial crime. But the environmentalists said they noticed at least one officer from the antiextremism department, which tracks opposition activists and had often conducted surveillance on the group.

The officers said they had received a complaint from a man named Dmitri Latyshev, who claimed that he had been in the headquarters and spotted unlicensed Microsoft software on the computers. The police produced a handwritten complaint from Mr. Latyshev, dated Jan. 27. The raid occurred the next day.

People at Baikal Wave said they had never seen or heard of Mr. Latyshev. Located in Irkutsk recently, Mr. Latyshev said by phone that he had filed the complaint but would not say why.

Baikal Wave’s leaders said they had known that the authorities used such raids to pressure advocacy groups, so they had made certain that all their software was legal.

But they quickly realized how difficult it would be to defend themselves.

They said they told the officers that they were mistaken, pulling out receipts and original Microsoft packaging to prove that the software was not pirated. The police did not appear to take that into consideration. A supervising officer issued a report on the spot saying that illegal software had been uncovered.

Before the raid, the environmentalists said their computers were affixed with Microsoft’s “Certificate of Authenticity” stickers that attested to the software’s legality. But as the computers were being hauled away, they noticed something odd: the stickers were gone.

In all, 12 computers were confiscated. The group’s Web site was disabled, its finances left in disarray, its plans disclosed to the authorities.

The police also obtained personnel information from the computers. In the following weeks, officers tracked down some of the group’s supporters and interrogated them.

“The police had one goal, which was to prevent us from working,” said Galina Kulebyakina, a co-chairwoman of Baikal Wave. “They removed our computers because we actively took a position against the paper factory and forcefully voiced it.”

“They can do pretty much what they want, with impunity,” she said.

A Company’s Pollution
The paper factory is located on Lake Baikal, the world’s oldest and deepest lake, which is home to hundreds of species that exist nowhere else, including a freshwater seal. Over the years, the factory has spewed mercury, chlorine, heavy metals and other pollutants into the water.

Baikal Wave rejoiced when the factory closed in 2008, having succumbed to sizable losses, as well as pressure from environmentalists. But after the financial crisis hit, the Kremlin worried about unrest from unemployment. In January, Mr. Putin reopened the factory, which has employed as many as 2,000 people, saying that it no longer polluted the lake.

Baikal Wave, which was founded in Irkutsk, one of Russia’s largest cities, as the Soviet Union was collapsing, began planning a protest. That was when the officers showed up.

In a statement, the Irkutsk police said the raid was proper. “The inspection of Baikal Environmental Wave was intended to protect intellectual property and had no connection whatsoever with the activities of the advocacy organization,” the statement said.

It said a forensic examination of the computers in February showed that several contained illegal software that would have cost more than $3,300. Baikal Wave said the examination was fraudulent.

Prosecutors say they are now weighing whether to press charges against Baikal Wave or its leaders. It is possible, though unlikely, that they could face jail time if convicted.

Neither Microsoft’s Moscow office nor its local lawyer contacted Baikal Wave to hear its side. The lawyer did provide testimony to the police about the value of the software that Baikal Wave was accused of illegally obtaining.

Baikal Wave sent copies of its software receipts and other documentation to Microsoft’s Moscow office to show that it had purchased the software legally. The group said it believed that the authorities would be under pressure to drop the case if Microsoft would confirm the documents’ authenticity.

Microsoft declined to do so. In a letter to Baikal Wave, the company said it would forward the materials only to the authorities in Irkutsk, which already had copies of them.

“A determination of the actual circumstances of this case and the question of whether a violation of the law took place is the duty of the court,” Microsoft said.

The company also told Baikal Wave that it was willing to have its specialists assist the police in Irkutsk in evaluating the computers.

In response to written questions, Alexander Strakh, Microsoft’s chief antipiracy lawyer in Moscow, said that in all these cases, Microsoft assisted the authorities only as called for under Russian law.

Mr. Strakh was asked whether Microsoft believed that these raids were a tool to suppress the opposition. “We have no direct knowledge of decisions by authorities to use investigations in that manner,” he said.

Microsoft has hired numerous private lawyers across Russia who represent the company in piracy cases. Several of the lawyers have cropped up in these politically sensitive inquiries.

This year, prosecutors in the southwestern city of Krasnodar brought a piracy case against an immigrant rights activist named Anastasia Denisova. She said in an interview that she was surprised at the aggressive posture of Microsoft’s local lawyer.

In an official document, the Interior Ministry said the case against Ms. Denisova was begun “based on an application” from the lawyer. (Microsoft’s Moscow office said that statement was not correct.)

Ms. Denisova said the lawyer overestimated the value of the allegedly pirated software. As a result, the accusations were more serious.

“The Microsoft lawyer was very active, coming to the court all the time, even though he was not summoned,” she said. “He also claimed that he was going to sue me, despite the fact that Microsoft had publicly stated that it would not do so against an advocacy group.”

In May, after Ms. Denisova had spent several months under the threat of a prison sentence, the charges were dropped. Prosecutors acknowledged that the investigation had been mishandled.

Samara, in Russia’s industrial heartland, has been a focal point for these raids. In May 2007, when Mr. Putin was holding a summit meeting there with European leaders, the police sought to prevent protests by seizing computers from several organizations, including Golos, an election monitoring and human rights group, and the local edition of Novaya Gazeta, the country’s most influential opposition newspaper.

Last year, they took computers from another newspaper, Samarskaya Gazeta. According to case records, the police conducted that search based upon a complaint from a man who admitted that he had never been in the newspaper’s offices or seen its computers.

Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev, the editor of both newspapers, said Microsoft’s lawyer in the case regularly appeared at court hearings to back prosecutors and the police. He said the lawyer testified that seized computers contained pirated software even though it was later shown that the computers had never been examined.

“Microsoft says publicly that they have no claims in these cases, but then their lawyers come into the court and say whatever the police want them to say,” Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev said.

The Damage Is Done
Prosecutors eventually dropped or suspended the charges against Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev after he was able to discredit them. But he said the damage was done. He said the newspapers lost computers and data, and he spent an enormous amount of time ensnared in legal proceedings. The local edition of Novaya Gazeta had to close.

Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev said he now realized that the authorities were not so much interested in convictions as in harassing opponents. Even if the inquiries are abandoned, they are debilitating when they require months to defend.

Microsoft’s Moscow office said its lawyers had conducted themselves properly in the cases in Krasnodar and Samara.

In Irkutsk, Baikal Environmental Wave has also struggled to recover from the raid. It located some old computers and was still able to hold protests against the paper factory.

The seized computers were not returned by the police until July, five months after they were removed. Their hard drives had been inspected by police experts in February. The environmentalists do not know whether all their data remain, and they are sure that files were copied.

Ms. Rikhvanova, one of the group’s co-founders, who has been fighting to defend Lake Baikal since the 1960s, was unable to use her computer. When she got it back, she discovered that it had been disabled by a virus."
172,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System," Iosif L. Nagle was watching a final curtain at his small theater company when he saw two young men waiting for him in the audience. They didn’t look like patrons of the arts — something about their faces marked them as law enforcement — and Mr. Nagle bundled up and followed them out into the cold.

A few minutes later the three of them were talking over glasses of vodka. The subject was the jury that Mr. Nagle sat on, which, after four months of testimony, was leaning toward acquittal on some charges brought by the government.

The visitors, showing him cards that identified them as security officers, said it would be awful if such a bunch of criminals went unpunished. Would he consider, one of them said, withdrawing from the jury on the grounds of illness? Mr. Nagle said he had refused without a thought.

“I told them, ‘Why should I say I’m sick? You did your job badly, guys,’ ” said Mr. Nagle, 56. “ ‘Why did you bring an unsubstantiated case to court?’ ”

He watched them drive away that night, more annoyed than frightened. But already jurors and alternates were dropping off the panel one by one, and as winter turned into spring, only 12 of them, the number needed for a jury trial, were left. Even as they edged close to a verdict, the question became whether they could stay together long enough to deliver it.

Juries were supposed to change Russia. Introduced amid a raft of liberal reforms in 1993, they shifted power away from the state structure and thrust it into the hands of citizens. Juries introduced real competition into Russia’s courts, granting acquittals in 15 to 20 percent of cases, compared with less than 1 percent in cases decided by judges.

But the state has never been happy about leaving the fate of high-profile prosecutions in the hands of ordinary people.

Some juries skeptical of a prosecution have been dismissed on the verge of important verdicts. When they vote to acquit, their verdicts are routinely overturned by higher courts, allowing prosecutors to try for a conviction before another jury. Lawmakers are continuously chipping away at what types of criminal offenses merit a jury trial.

Meanwhile, the number of jury trials remains so small — around 600 a year out of a total of more than one million — that they vanish into a justice system that in some important ways has changed little since Soviet days.

The people on Mr. Nagle’s jury last summer were ordinary Muscovites: highbrow intellectuals, a gray-suited businessman, a couple of morning drinkers who got tossed out early. One juror, a dainty woman who operates a crane, arrived in the metropolis at age 20 with a single suitcase. The foreman had acted at Moscow’s most revered theater company.

All of them grew up in a country with no jury system. Mr. Nagle, artistic director at Moscow’s French Language Theater, gorged on Perry Mason novels and “Twelve Angry Men” before showing up, his professional interest piqued by “this human comedy which goes on” in the jury room. Rakhilya Z. Salnikova, the crane operator, also came eagerly.

“I felt that it would be an honor for me, that they would have that much trust in me,” she said. They settled in to listen to testimony, she said, “as if we were watching a film.”

No Ordinary Case
Igor V. Izmestiev, who sat in the metal defendant’s cage in the courtroom, had the sleek, well-fed look of the new rich. Though there were 12 other defendants, accused of carrying out contract hits for him, this was the man who mattered, the one at the vortex of power and money.

A multimillionaire and former senator, Mr. Izmestiev, 44, had risen to prominence in his native Bashkortostan, a southwestern republic that sits on enormous reserves of crude oil. He owed much of his success to Murtaza G. Rakhimov, who for two decades ran the region like a personal fief.

Mr. Izmestiev was partners with Mr. Rakhimov’s son Ural, whose fortune Forbes estimated at $1.2 billion, and was so close to the family, his lawyer said, that Mr. Rakhimov called him “his second son.”

Mr. Izmestiev’s political cover caved in spectacularly, and he was arrested on suspicion of murder in 2007. Commentators offered various explanations for the extraordinary prosecution, most often that it served as a warning shot to the Rakhimovs, who were finally forced from power this summer.

Whatever the reason, charges against Mr. Izmestiev accumulated until they included attempting to bribe a Federal Security Service agent, organizing and leading a criminal gang, ordering five murders and six attacks, burning down a printing business, and attempting to kill Ural Rakhimov. A new charge, terrorism, was tacked on in 2008. The jury trial was closed to the public, another move that caught the attention of legal activists.

“I don’t know if he is guilty or not,” said Lev A. Ponomarev, founder of the group For Human Rights, “but I can say for sure that it is a political question.”

In the jury room, a few on the panel were beginning to say the same thing. They were split, occasionally arguing so passionately that the bailiff had to come in, said Lidia S. Vasilyeva, one of the jurors. She felt that Mr. Izmestiev was probably guilty of some wrongdoing, but not the list of charges he was facing.

“You don’t get that kind of money without getting your hands dirty,” she said, “but everything they tried to hang on him, it was absurd.”

She was one of four jurors who told The New York Times that they were not convinced.

“I think that guilt, not just of one person, but of several people, was not proven,” said Teimuraz Bagylly, a businessman who also serves as deputy director of a legal research group, who withdrew after five months to attend a professional conference. Ms. Salnikova, who dropped out to return to work, agreed.

“I looked at them and thought, ‘This isn’t believable,’ ” she said.

By the time the trial was half over, Mr. Nagle said, he had been persuaded that the charges were driven by politics and money. He said at least half the jury had agreed with him.

“All this seemed unconvincing and unproven, practically the whole prosecution, with very few small exceptions,” he said. “We expected that there would be some main evidence which proved everything. But it never appeared.”

‘Like Spiders in a Jar’
Mr. Nagle did not feel frightened by the investigators who came to visit him that winter. They were his son’s age, he recalled, and he used a sterner tone with them than they did with him. They seemed to accept his answer, he said.

“They understood that threats would only get resistance out of me,” he said.

When he returned to jury duty, he submitted a note informing the judge that law enforcement officials had urged him to withdraw, a blatant violation of Russian law, which grants jurors the same protection from influence as judges. But there was no response, he said.

Two months later, Ms. Vasilyeva said, she too was approached by young men who suggested, during a friendly conversation, that she drop off the jury.

“They said, ‘We know you are leaning toward a verdict of acquittal,’ ” she said. “I said ‘I am not the only one.’ I said I could only speak for myself — I don’t know what another person has in their head.

“I must say that made me feel angry,” she said. “I got really mad. It was anger and nothing but anger.”

By late February, seven months into the trial, 10 jurors had dropped out. The withdrawal of one more would result in a dismissal. But two or three weeks were all they needed to reach deliberations.

Or that’s what they thought on Feb. 25, when the judge announced that a victim in the case was sick and the trial would have to wait until he could make a statement.

February turned into March and then April — three feet of crusty snow melted into a slushy deluge — and the 12 of them would remain in the jury room, playing cards or working crossword puzzles, on the days when they were called to appear. First they felt like uninvited guests and then, said Ms. Vasilyeva, like “spiders in a jar.” The delays made them angry, and in some cases, suspicious.

By May it was a test of endurance. Juror No. 4 kept complaining that she was needed in her hometown in Siberia, where her mother was sick. The juror was so reluctant to break the quorum that she twice bought airplane tickets and returned them, Ms. Vasilyeva said. Though they were still split on the question of guilt, all 12 felt a stubborn desire to finish, she said.

“I said to everybody, ‘Let’s go through to the verdict. I’m happy to sit here all night,’” she said.

She was not the only person in suspense. Sergei Antonov, the defense attorney, had felt confident since the fall, when he watched jurors smirking at prosecution witnesses. Then, one of the investigators assigned to the case had approached him in the smoking room and congratulated him on winning, he said.

“He said, ‘We listen to the jury and we know they are tending toward acquittal,’ ” he said.

But as the recess dragged on, Mr. Antonov realized that one of 12 jurors was bound to drop out.

“When nothing is happening, sooner or later the question arises, ‘Does it make sense to show up tomorrow?’ ” he said. “These people, for three months, they came every day. I realized that they wanted to give a verdict.”

But the filaments that held them together were fraying. The fourth juror submitted a note saying she was leaving for Siberia, and offering to return to Moscow if testimony resumed, said her fellow jurors. On May 12, the panel was dismissed.

‘There Is No Justice’
Ms. Vasilyeva, a retired telephone operator, professes herself entirely uninterested in politics — she rarely reads a newspaper, she said proudly. But as the jury’s designated mother hen, she was angry enough to speak publicly about the dismissal, about how unprotected jurors are from outside influence, how hard they worked to reach a verdict, how frustrating it was not to deliver it.

“Where money and politics are mixed up,” she said, “there is no justice.”

Mr. Nagle was similarly outspoken. He complained that “in old age, I have become disappointed in the justice system,” and told a television news crew about being approached by law enforcement and asked to drop out.

The experience left such a sour taste in his mouth, he said, that he tries not to dwell on it.

“The law doesn’t work. People in power can do whatever they want with the law,” he said. “It is always unpleasant when some of your illusions are destroyed.”

The only answer he has gotten is an indirect one.

A few days after Mr. Nagle described his complaints on the air, Pervy Kanal, the state-controlled television station, aired a segment devoted to the crimes of Mr. Izmestiev, concluding that “it is impossible to extract details from this porridge of politics, oil and blood, but it’s clear it has been brewed by one thing: big money.”

The camera cut to the host of the show, Aleksei V. Pimanov, a powerful television executive who has recently been nominated by the governing party, United Russia, to become a senator. Mr. Pimanov delivered a barbed message to the jurors who had spoken out, implying that they had been bribed by the defense.

“We would not have made this program while the case was going on if it had not been for the very strange behavior of these former jurors,” said Mr. Pimanov. “Something tells me that their statements — made in violation of all rules and laws — were made for a good reason. What that reason was, you can guess for yourselves.”

Since then, the jurors have kept quiet.

As for the case against Mr. Izmestiev, it will most likely end with a verdict in a matter of weeks.

This time the state is taking no chances. A spokesman for Russia’s general prosecutor, Yury Y. Chaika, would not respond to an inquiry from The Times on the matter, saying the case is still pending. But at a ceremony honoring investigators this fall, Mr. Chaika singled out the Izmestiev prosecution as a singular success.

He has every reason to be confident.

This spring, while the jurors were playing cards in the jury room, Russia’s Constitutional Court ruled that terrorism cases were too important to be trusted to ordinary citizens — they are, the court reasoned, too vulnerable to intimidation.

So this time, the verdict will be decided by a panel of three judges."
173,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System,"On the eve of regional elections, an opposition candidate named Olga V. Safronova arrived at a school for a campaign finale. She planned a rousing speech with a refrain that Russia had been seized by a dictatorial ruling party.

But operatives from that very party showed up to stop her.

What displeased them was this: Ms. Safronova’s political party was supposed to be a fake opposition, created by the Kremlin to give the illusion that Russia was a thriving democracy. Now, though, this puppet party was rebelling here in Siberia — battling for votes, defying the governing party and even assailing Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin himself.

The governing party — in coordination with the authorities themselves — soon responded. And their efforts to suppress Ms. Safronova’s party, A Just Russia, seemed to underscore how laws intended to guarantee free and fair elections carry little weight in Russia.

The governing party operatives tried to bar Ms. Safronova from the school. They called the police to interrogate her. They warned teachers and others that they would be fired if they attended, and most left. Ms. Safronova ignored the threats and began speaking in an auditorium that was nearly deserted. Even so, the operatives sought to shout her down.

“You do not have permission to speak here!” said Gennadi V. Bykovsky, a former prosecutor and aide to the governing party candidate. “We don’t want to hear your blabbering.”

Ms. Safronova lashed back. “You are corrupt!” she said. “Do you see this? They can violate the law as much as they want. And me? How dare I! I should be lined up against the wall and shot for just trying to express my point of view.”

All around Novosibirsk, A Just Russia came under pressure, and had little chance of defending itself. The police raided the party’s offices, and the state television channel accused it of conducting a dirty campaign. Local officials even emblazoned logos of the governing party, United Russia, on city bulldozers to give the party, not the government, credit for fixing roads.

On Election Day, hundreds of soldiers from a military garrison were marched to a polling place and ordered to vote for United Russia, according to nonpartisan voting monitors.

It was as if the governing party and the government had merged, just as in the Communist era. And in many ways, they have. United Russia effectively controls regional governments, prosecutor’s offices, courts, police departments and election commissions.

Up against this colossus went Ms. Safronova, 53, a former Kremlin supporter who grew increasingly frustrated with the country’s political stagnation and decided to do something about it this year. She mounted her campaign for regional assembly, and worked to transform A Just Russia in Novosibirsk, Russia’s third largest city.

From the start, Ms. Safronova realized that the odds were against her.

She dressed like a corporate lawyer on the campaign trail, slogging through the mud of a dairy farm in the city suburbs in high heels. But the truth was that she was a widow with little money who lived with her mother, son and granddaughter in a threadbare housing project that looked as if it had not been renovated since Brezhnev’s time. She had long blond hair that she sometimes styled in a classic Slavic peasant braid, as if to hark back to her rural roots.

An economist by training, she had made many enemies as regional leader of a group called the Public Anticorruption Committee and, before that, as an advocate for small business in Novosibirsk. She expected that the governing party would be infuriated with the regional branch of A Just Russia. And so she was not surprised when she received menacing phone calls from people who would not identify themselves.

“They say, if I don’t end my campaign, they will kill me,” she said.

Still, she thought that even if she did not win, she could secure a high enough percentage of the vote to help prove that Russia had a viable new opposition at the regional level.

If United Russia went unchallenged, she insisted, then Russia would end up like the Soviet Union: foundering under the corrupt and incompetent reign of a single party.

“We are hoping that a massive number of people will come out on Election Day and declare that they will not take this anymore,” she said shortly before the voting. “We are striving to create a true multiparty system, a real democracy in Russia.”

To United Russia, those were fighting words.

A Puppet Rival Party
When the Kremlin birthed A Just Russia in October 2006, Mr. Putin, then Russia’s president, said the new party would “promote democratic values.” But it would also allow the Russian leadership to declare that the country had a multiparty system — even though A Just Russia was loyal to Mr. Putin.

His political aides also believed that A Just Russia (sometimes translated as Fair Russia) would siphon votes from the Communist Party, which still has support from the elderly, as well as people disgruntled with the country’s lurch toward capitalism. A Just Russia was to be left-leaning and modeled on Social Democratic movements in Europe.

But some Russians hunger for an alternative to the governing party and the Communists. From the day that the party was set up, some of its regional leaders agitated to split from the Kremlin. This year, in places like Novosibirsk, that movement started taking off.

Novosibirsk, with a population of 1.4 million people, was fertile ground because it is one of the country’s most progressive regions, site of a hub of prestigious universities.

What’s more, across the country, the governing party’s popularity before the Oct. 10 election was suffering. Public discontent was rising because of the weak economy and the authorities’ mishandling of crises over the summer, including a heat wave and forest fires. In Novosibirsk, United Russia was plunged into crisis when one of its own representatives got up in the regional assembly and unexpectedly repudiated the party. His microphone was cut off.

Regional chapters of A Just Russia had tried to wage authentic campaigns before, but the one here in October was among the fiercest. The headquarters of A Just Russia in Moscow referred to these newly assertive tactics as the “Novosibirsk experiment.” It viewed the election as a warm-up for national parliamentary balloting next year.

The party’s national leader, Sergei M. Mironov, who is head of the upper house of Parliament, visited the city and channeled funds to the campaign. (Because of Mr. Mironov’s prominence, the local authorities did not hamper him when he held campaign events here, his aides said.)

Mr. Mironov is a Putin ally, but he began drawing a distinction, vigorously opposing Mr. Putin’s party while usually — though not always — backing Mr. Putin himself. It was not clear why Mr. Putin tolerated this. There was speculation that he thought that competition would keep United Russia’s regional cadres from becoming complacent.

Whatever the case, people like Ms. Safronova flocked to A Just Russia. She became a regional aide to Mr. Mironov. For her assembly campaign, she put together a team of volunteers who had assisted her on anticorruption activities. But they, too, were subjected to pressure, especially younger men.

Rustam Mamedov, 34, who owns a construction business, said he joined A Just Russia because he was angered by constant demands to pay bribes to city officials. He said that in the weeks before the election, he was regularly threatened by United Russia officials, as well as the police. He recalled one phone call from an official whom he would not name.

“He told me that if we did not terminate our campaign, we would have very serious problems,” Mr. Mamedov said. “He made clear that he would get us in trouble with the narcotics police by planting drugs on us and then having us arrested. That’s what they usually do.”

Like others in the Safronova campaign, Mr. Mamedov did not relent, but he said he restricted his movements as the election neared. While his accusations could not be independently confirmed, such accounts were echoed by other volunteers for A Just Russia who were interviewed separately.

United Russia was especially angered that its rival printed hundreds of thousands of party newspapers that took aim at United Russia over basic issues like pensions, utility costs, corruption and food prices. “United Russia is a business,” one newspaper said. “It is a shameless, cynical and greedy business that is picking the pockets of the taxpayers.”

The police detained workers for A Just Russia who distributed the newspapers, and United Russia’s youth wing held a rally in the central square of Novosibirsk, where it dumped copies of the papers into a large waste bin marked “Garbage, Lies, Filth.”

In late September, the police went further, raiding the headquarters of A Just Russia and confiscating bundles of newspapers. The pretext was a bureaucratic error — the party had allegedly failed to fill out paperwork related to the printing of the newspapers.

United Russia leaders voiced exasperation at A Just Russia, saying that the party was so desperate for votes that it routinely violated the election law. They said A Just Russia sought to use legitimate law-enforcement activities to portray itself as a victim.

“They deliberately provoke these operations,” said Viktor A. Ignatov, a senior United Russia official in Novosibirsk. “If the police had not removed the literature, A Just Russia would have invented some way to provoke the police into doing it. They simply do outrageous things. If we had used such methods, our people would have long ago been arrested.”

It was just before the election, and Mr. Ignatov expressed confidence in his party’s prospects.

“I think that the Just Russia ‘project’ has been a failure,” he said.

A Candidate Fights On
But Ms. Safronova soldiered on. She was an animated speaker, able to connect with audiences by drawing upon her years in the trenches going up against crooked local officials. Even so, she often did not get a chance to get to the podium.

She booked a municipal cultural center for an event, and at the last moment, was told that the building had been closed for repairs. When she drove by soon after, it was open and decorated with balloons to attract visitors. She wanted to meet workers at a sprawling hospital, but her request was rejected on the grounds that it was a “sanitary zone.”

“My United Russia opponent was later welcomed there,” she said. “Apparently, he had no germs.”

Regional election officials denied that opposition candidates faced obstacles to campaigning, but such tactics were widely documented in Novosibirsk by Golos, the country’s leading nonpartisan voting rights monitor.

Nadezhda A. Lantsova, a senior coordinator in the city for Golos, said the government sought to hinder the opposition more this year than in any campaign in recent memory. She said the governing party seemed to view A Just Russia as a potent contender, to be taken more seriously than the Communists, who are seen as having limited support.

“Officials who do not obey the ruling party in relation to its campaign needs are simply fired from their jobs,” Ms. Lantsova said. “And the party can do this with impunity.”

By Election Day, Ms. Safronova was feeling beaten down but knew that she had to persevere because the next 24 hours would be crucial. Ballot-stuffing and other electoral misconduct is rampant in Russia, and it almost always benefits the governing party.

She visited as many polling places as possible so that United Russia operatives would know that she was watching. But when she monitored the returns, she sensed that something was wrong. Some polling places were delaying reporting totals.

When the results from those polling places finally arrived in the middle of the night, several showed spikes in turnout, as well as implausibly high totals for the governing party candidate — nearly 80 percent of the vote in some cases. It was a classic sign of vote-rigging, according to election experts who examined the totals.

Ms. Safronova ended up losing badly, coming in third with only 16 percent of the vote. The governing party candidate, Anatoly V. Zhukov, triumphed with 49 percent.

Overall, United Russia did not fare as well in Novosibirsk as it did in other regions, but it still dominated, garnering 50 out of 76 seats in the regional assembly.

Local election officials pronounced themselves pleased with the conduct of the election. “A Just Russia is putting out incorrect information, to my great regret,” said Tamara I. Aleksenko, chairwoman of the Novosibirsk regional election commission. “This was as democratic as you can get. Everything was done according to the law.”

Ms. Safronova did not agree. The day after the election, she was poring over the returns at the headquarters of A Just Russia when she started receiving phone calls from friends, expressing condolences. She had kept her composure until then, but something seemed to snap. She walked out to the corridor, her eyes filled with tears.

“This was so dirty, so dishonest,” she said. “I would understand if it had been an honest fight, but it was not. I have no desire to do this again. Maybe there will come a time when I will think differently. But for now, no.”

She decided to put it behind her and resume her anticorruption work, but others apparently had not forgotten. Last week, several men abruptly descended upon her office, threw down some documents and threatened to beat her if she did not leave immediately. The building was owned by the government, and she was being evicted."
174,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System,"It was more than a year ago when six members of an obscure oversight panel filed into Butyrskaya Prison to look into the death of a prisoner.

They were hardly an intimidating bunch: retired women in hats, mostly, scribbling their observations in notebooks, regarded by the prison staff as a minor irritant, like fleas.

In a country whose law enforcement structures wield enormous power, it is easy enough to ignore civilian watchdog groups. But this day was different. When the doctors were led in and told to take a seat, the panel’s leader, a veteran human rights activist named Valery V. Borshchev, felt something unfamiliar in the air.

“They lied to us, of course,” Mr. Borshchev later recalled. “But they were frightened. And the fact that they were frightened gave us hope that something would really change.”

The man who had died was Sergei L. Magnitsky. His death in pretrial detention at the age of 37, officially recorded as resulting from sudden heart failure, sent shudders through Moscow’s elite. They saw him — a post-Soviet young urban professional — as someone uncomfortably like themselves. He had been arrested after accusing police investigators of a huge tax fraud, and he died awaiting trial.

A full account of Mr. Magnitsky’s death, the group knew, could restore some confidence in Russia’s legal system. A whitewash, on the other hand, could erode what faith remained.

Investigating the death meant confronting Russia’s security structures — the police, prosecutors, courts, prisons and prison doctors, all links in a self-protective chain. The findings, however decisive, would have to compete with an official inquiry, which would ultimately determine if anyone would be prosecuted.

Even so, they felt oddly hopeful. President Dmitri A. Medvedev, by all accounts genuinely angry over Mr. Magnitsky’s death, insisted that state prosecutors stop dragging their feet and open a case. Two days later, a top prison administrator admitted “obvious violations on our part” to a Kremlin advisory group.

In a country ruled more by commands than by laws, a command had gone out: This time someone would have to be punished.

So the inspectors walked into Butyrskaya with uncommon confidence.

“We could cover ourselves with this comment and say, ‘The president demanded an investigation,’ ” said Lyubov V. Volkova, deputy head of the panel, known as the Public Oversight Commission. “It was like an umbrella. We could go in and say, show us this, show us that. We are under this umbrella.”

Unlikely Detectives

Ms. Volkova and her colleagues were hardly detectives. Their group was brand new, approved by Mr. Medvedev after more than a decade of lobbying the government. They were empowered to inspect cells and investigate complaints, but their recommendations were not binding. In their berets and reading glasses, they seemed to pose little threat. But once inside Butyrskaya, the commission members were neck deep in a criminal investigation.

They moved from cell to cell, standing in the last spaces Mr. Magnitsky had occupied, seeing the last people he saw. They paged through sheaves of complaints he made: there were more than 400, as many as three a day, sometimes written by hand. The picture of a man began to take shape before them.

“Every day, in prisons, we see beaten, constrained, terrified people, who don’t complain about anything,” said Ms. Volkova, 62, a brash blonde partial to satin pants and animal prints. “Magnitsky complained. And the more he complained, the worse they made it for him. And then he complained again.”

“He is the only one we’ve seen like this,” she said.

There were signs that something had gone badly wrong. A doctor on the prison’s medical staff who had been treating Mr. Magnitsky for abdominal pain appeared more distraught than others interviewed by the group. Three days before his death, she told them, Mr. Magnitsky complained about vomiting and severe pain on his right side.

That was a Friday, and she went home for the weekend. No doctor saw him again until Monday, and then, she said, he had “acute, belting pain, vomiting every three hours.” It looked to her as if he had acute pancreatitis, which left untreated can lead to organ failure. As the commission members hastily took notes, the doctor described her alarm, saying: “It was necessary to push for an examination. I thought he had a chronic disease.”

At this, the commission members’ ears pricked up. Whom did she have to lobby to get Mr. Magnitsky treated?

But the conversation was cut short. At that moment, Mr. Borshchev recalled, a prison official walked up behind the doctor, grasped her by the shoulders, and took her out of the room.

Tracing a Prisoner's Journey
Mr. Borshchev learned about prisons in the 1970s, when, as a close friend of the Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov, he ferried books and sausages to the outskirts of penal colonies to be passed to political prisoners. From his own interrogations for dissident activities, he knew that a prisoner needed a plan to withstand official pressure. He had his own plan: As soon as the investigator raised his voice, he would stop talking and gaze out the window.

Now 68, Mr. Borshchev has fat streaks of white in his beard, and peers over his glasses as if he is presiding over his own personal Supreme Court.

At Butyrskaya, he walked from one cell to another, tracing eight transfers Mr. Magnitsky underwent in the last three months of his life. The cells were increasingly cramped, dark and dirty.

Though a prison doctor had diagnosed gallstones and pancreatitis and ordered a follow-up ultrasound, Mr. Magnitsky was suddenly transferred to Butyrskaya, which had minimal medical facilities. There he had an attack, writing of pain “so acute that I was not even able to lie down.” In September, Oleg F. Silchenko, lead investigator in the case, refused Mr. Magnitsky’s appeal to advocate for the ultrasound, saying investigators were under no obligation to intervene. The ultrasound never happened.

Mr. Magnitsky was allowed only one visit with his wife and mother for the full 11 months he was in custody; they attended court hearings so they could stare at him from across the room. He passed the time by reading Shakespeare’s tragedies. When overcome with anxiety or despair, a cellmate later said, he would turn his face to the wall, as if he wanted it to swallow him up.

To Mr. Borshchev, there was only one way to interpret this: the prisoner was refusing to cooperate. Indeed, Mr. Magnitsky’s job at a Russian-American law firm drew him into a battle between William F. Browder — once the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market — and the Interior Ministry, which oversees law enforcement. In 2007, Mr. Browder’s company, Hermitage Capital, based on Mr. Magnitsky’s research, accused police investigators of an immense act of corruption, charging that they had seized three of Mr. Browder’s subsidiary companies and used them to receive a $230 million tax refund.

The next year, the Interior Ministry charged Mr. Browder’s companies with evading $17.5 million in taxes. As soon as Mr. Magnitsky was arrested, investigators were pushing him to testify against someone, presumably Mr. Browder, said his defense lawyer, Dmitri V. Kharitonov. But he refused.

The commission’s narrative flowed with some logic until it reached Nov. 16, 2009, the day he died. The nervous doctor sent Mr. Magnitsky to another prison, which had a hospital. There, the oversight panel met a surgeon named Dr. Aleksandra V. Gaus, who said she noted upon his arrival that he had symptoms of acute pancreatitis and prepared to send him for treatment.

At 7 p.m., Dr. Gaus said, he started to act erratically, and she changed her mind, determining that he was suffering from “acute psychosis and persecutory delusions.” She called a team of eight guards to forcibly subdue him, and they handcuffed him to the bed in an isolation cell to wait for a psychiatric emergency team. An hour and a half later, officials said, he collapsed when the psychiatrist was examining him, and was rushed to intensive care for resuscitation. He was declared dead at 9:50 p.m.

Mr. Borshchev was mulling over this account when he got a startling phone call. A few days earlier, he had left his card for the psychiatrist who was present at Mr. Magnitsky’s death. On the phone was the psychiatrist, Dr. Vitaly V. Kornilov, who told a different story: He and his team had been forced to wait at the clinic’s outer gates for a full hour — roughly from 8 until 9 p.m. — before they were allowed inside.

By the time he entered the cell, as Dr. Kornilov would later tell the official investigators, “we were presented with the fact that we could not carry out a psychiatric examination because of the lack of a patient.”

“The head of the corpse was tilted toward his left shoulder, his eyes were open and wide,” he said, according to official documents. “No heartbeat could be felt, no breath or arterial pressure was felt, his skin was pale and cool. Biological death had occurred 15 minutes before.”

The Panel Reports
Six weeks after Mr. Magnitsky’s death, Mr. Borshchev published the commission’s report. He was pleased; though there were still gaps and contradictions, he was sure the commission had uncovered enough to show that someone could be charged, if only for negligence. “When undesirable information gets into the case file, it starts working by itself,” he said. “It must be disproved or else unraveled.”

But another inquiry — the official one — was taking place out of public view. Around 12 hours after Mr. Magnitsky died, his body was examined by a coroner who reported that Mr. Magnitsky’s death was as sudden and unpredictable as a lightning strike. In her report, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, she listed the cause of death as heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease that sometimes makes headlines when young athletes collapse in the middle of a game. She found no evidence that he was suffering from pancreatitis.

The autopsy would undergo a series of expert analyses — one of which involved dozens of specialists and was headed by the country’s most famous cardiologist. That panel was confident enough to provide what appeared to be an endpoint to the investigation.

“The drawbacks in medical aid given to Magnitsky,” they wrote, “have no connection to his death.”

Still, the experts did not hide their dissatisfaction. After reviewing accounts from medical staff members, they said the testimony was so contradictory that they could not even determine the time or place of Mr. Magnitsky’s death, official documents show. They were given such paltry documentation that they “couldn’t give an objective assessment of medical care” or determine whether a crime occurred.

They noted that none of Mr. Magnitsky’s doctors had showed concern over his heart, and that diagnostic work done three weeks before his death showed no signs of heart disease.

Moreover, no blood samples were taken when Mr. Magnitsky arrived at the hospital — “the lab only works during the day, and it was night,” Dr. Gaus told a forensic expert — and little toxicology screening was done after his death. So it is difficult to know whether his symptoms were caused by septic shock, an overdose of some agent, or some other form of poisoning. And there was little explanation for the fact that he had been left in a cell for more than an hour in a state of acute distress.

By fall, police officials were so confident that they began to go on the attack. At a ceremony to observe Militia Day, the Interior Ministry bestowed public honors on the investigators who helped put Mr. Magnitsky in prison. On the anniversary of his death, the ministry held a news conference to announce an astounding new accusation: He himself was guilty, said a spokeswoman, of applying for a fraudulent $230 million tax refund. That is the crime Hermitage had reported to prosecutors in 2007.

The inquiry Mr. Medvedev had ordered was extended a second time, but now a new signal had gone out: No arrest was imminent.

“There is no basis to believe that his death was connected to the officials carrying out his prosecution,” Aleksandr Bastrykin, director of the Investigative Committee, the Russian agency that was charged with inquiring into his death, said in September.

No Longer Waiting
Mr. Borshchev had long since stopped waiting for a response to his report. He was at home listening to the radio one day when he heard Aleksei V. Anichin, the head of the Interior Ministry unit that handled Mr. Magnitsky’s case, say that his investigators were “the people who suffered the most from Mr. Magnitsky’s death” — because they lost the opportunity to convict him.

“After this statement,” he said, “it became clear that the investigation is not interested in finding the truth.”

Something had changed during the year, and the members of the Public Oversight Commission felt it as keenly as anyone. When the time came to nominate the new members of the panel — whose single high-profile act had been its damning report on Mr. Magnitsky’s death — the candidates were not well known in human rights circles.

Two were from the Association of Professional Security Guards; two were from the Veterans of the Secret Services; another two were from the Association of Retired Police Operatives; two were from the Association of Police Veterans. The balance on the panel is now so tenuous that Mr. Borshchev fears he will be replaced as the body’s president. One of his critics on the panel, Anton V. Tsvetkov of the Officers of Russia Foundation, complained about “nihilists who disavow everything, who criticize everything,” but said his position had nothing to do with the report on Mr. Magnitsky’s death. “I don’t think anyone read that report,” he said.

Two weeks ago, the state’s lead investigator for the first time asked to interview Mr. Borshchev and Ms. Volkova about their research in the case. They sat together for three hours, meticulously reviewing the findings, which are to be attached to the official file. As they left, Mr. Borshchev said, he clung to the hope that Mr. Medvedev might still press to uncover what really happened.

Ms. Volkova said she was exhausted from the effort of hoping. “I have begun to feel sorry for our president, for Medvedev,” she said. “I look at him and say: ‘Poor, poor boy. Are you really going to clean up all this dirt that they are producing? These hundreds of thousands of corrupt people?’ I am sure that he is the most pitiable person.”

“Nothing was stopping him from giving an order, at least, not to give awards to the investigators,” she said. “Nothing stopped him.”"
175,NYT,Levy,2011,Russia Justice System," In a small courtroom in Moscow, friends of Natalya K. Estemirova crowded onto wooden benches, clasping photographs of her. It was 16 months after the murder of Ms. Estemirova, a renowned human rights advocate in the tumultuous region of Chechnya, and now the legal system was taking action.

A defendant was on trial, and his interrogators were demanding answers about special operations and assassination plots.

But the defendant was not Ms. Estemirova’s suspected killer. It was her colleague Oleg P. Orlov, chairman of Memorial, one of Russia’s foremost human rights organizations.

The authorities had charged Mr. Orlov with defamation because he had publicly pointed the finger at the man he believed was responsible for the murder: the Kremlin-installed leader of Chechnya. If convicted, Mr. Orlov could face as many as three years in prison.

The shooting of Ms. Estemirova, 51, in July 2009 has so far produced only an incomplete investigation, and no charges have been filed against anyone involved. Her case has instead turned into an example of what often happens in Russia when high-ranking officials fall under scrutiny. Retaliation follows, and the accuser becomes the accused.

Mr. Orlov, who first raised his voice against official wrongdoing as an anti-Soviet pamphleteer in the 1980s, has found himself under an unrelenting legal siege from the Chechen leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov.

Mr. Kadyrov’s attempt to silence Mr. Orlov reflects an increasingly common tactic in Russia. The authorities do not summarily imprison their critics as dissidents, as in Communist times. They instead often invoke an array of civil and criminal charges, including defamation, to exact financial penalties or prison sentences. They haul their opponents before judges who are wary of handing down decisions against those in power.

Mr. Kadyrov, who denies any connection to Ms. Estemirova’s killing, rules unchallenged in Chechnya. Still, he has portrayed Memorial as a treacherous and violent organization. In seeking charges against Mr. Orlov in Moscow, 1,000 miles from Chechnya, he effectively quashed the idea that the Russian capital offers sanctuary for those pursuing human rights issues in remote regions. No one from the Kremlin has come to Mr. Orlov’s defense.

Mr. Kadyrov’s lawyer, who under the law can work with the prosecution during the proceedings, has even used the trial to promote his own black-is-white theory of Ms. Estemirova’s death. “Maybe Memorial itself ordered the killing” to discredit Mr. Kadyrov, said the lawyer, Andrei A. Krasnenkov.

Mr. Orlov has been allowed to remain free while the trial continues, and has not recanted his criticism of Mr. Kadyrov, who has been assailed by human rights groups for his brutal methods in quelling the Islamic insurgency in Chechnya.

Mr. Orlov said that Mr. Kadyrov, if not directly responsible for ordering Ms. Estemirova’s murder, was at a minimum responsible for demonizing her and for indicating to his associates that he would not mind if she were no longer around. Mr. Orlov said Mr. Kadyrov had to be held accountable for the climate of bloodshed and fear in Chechnya.

With his shaggy mop of gray hair and sport coats — no tie, even in court — Mr. Orlov, 57, resembles an unassuming history professor. But during his tenure, Memorial has expanded well beyond its historical mission of remembering victims of Communist persecution. It has delved into some of the most provocative issues in Russia, from Chechnya to the rights of the political opposition.

“Of course, I don’t want to go to prison and lose my freedom,” Mr. Orlov said the other day at his office, which has a large bulletin board that is a shrine of sorts to Ms. Estemirova, who was also known as Natasha.

“But those words that I said were only a minimal debt owed to the murdered Natasha Estemirova,” he said. “This was the least that I could do for the memory of my deceased comrade and friend. I had to do it. I told the truth.”

Getting at the Truth
Natalya Estemirova was a former history teacher with a knack for putting victims at ease and a willingness to venture into conflict zones to get at the truth. As a senior researcher for Memorial in Chechnya, she had repeatedly documented atrocities committed by the security forces. Her findings had led to successful rulings against the government at the European Court of Human Rights — the only place many Russians feel they can obtain justice.

She did not support Islamic extremists in Chechnya, and did not shy from detailing their misdeeds. But she wanted the authorities to suppress the insurgency lawfully.

Mr. Kadyrov is a former militant who switched sides and became a Kremlin ally. He rose to power after his father, the Chechen president, was assassinated in 2004. Three years later, Vladimir V. Putin, then Russia’s president, named Mr. Kadyrov to lead Chechnya. He was only 30 years old. A bearded and muscular amateur boxer, he likes to brandish weapons before the cameras and show off a personal zoo, stocked with a tiger, ostriches and other exotica. The Kremlin has credited him with stabilizing and rebuilding Chechnya.

Mr. Kadyrov has often said that Ms. Estemirova and Memorial manufactured their conclusions in order to curry favor with Western donors and weaken Russia.

In 2008, witnesses at the current Orlov trial testified, Mr. Kadyrov tried to sideline Ms. Estemirova by appointing her to a government human rights panel. He apparently reasoned that if she had an official role, she would not go public with her criticism.

Soon after, Ms. Estemirova gave an interview with a national television network in which she disparaged rules in Chechnya requiring women to wear Islamic head scarves.

“I generally don’t like it when someone imposes something on me, dictates something to me or orders me around — how to live, how to dress,” Ms. Estemirova said.

Mr. Kadyrov, a major proponent of the rules, was infuriated, and at a meeting, fired her from the rights board.

“Natasha said he spoke to her very aggressively, in a hostile tone, and periodically broke into screaming,” a colleague, Yekaterina Sokiryanskaya, told the court this month.

“He threatened Natasha, and expressed his extreme displeasure with Natasha’s work in particular,” Ms. Sokiryanskaya said. “He said his arms were covered in blood up to his elbows. He said he had killed people, and he was not ashamed of it because he fought against the enemies of Chechnya.”

Ms. Sokiryanskaya then recounted the most chilling part. Mr. Kadyrov asked Ms. Estemirova whether she had a daughter, though he knew that she did. He posed another question: Did she ever fear for her daughter’s safety?

Ms. Estemirova left the meeting and fled Russia with her teenage daughter. It was the second time that she had gone into exile after being berated by Mr. Kadyrov, her friends said. But after a few months, she returned, still criticizing Mr. Kadyrov and his security forces.

In July 2009, Ms. Estemirova was compiling information about how the security services were setting fire to the homes of relatives of suspected militants. A senior Chechen official complained to a colleague of hers that she was smearing Chechnya’s reputation.

The official made reference to Anna Politkovskaya, the crusading opposition journalist who was killed in 2006 and was Ms. Estemirova’s friend. He said that if Ms. Politkovskaya had trod more cautiously, she would still be alive.

Ms. Estemirova’s superiors in Moscow grew alarmed and began planning to evacuate her again. But it was too late.

As she left her apartment in Grozny, the Chechen capital, on July 15, she was shoved into a car by unidentified men, who drove her to the neighboring region of Ingushetia.

She was found shot to death on the side of a road. None of her valuables or documents were stolen. The authorities were not able to explain how her assailants transported her through several police checkpoints without being detected.

First Grief, Then Anger
When the news of Ms. Estemirova’s murder reached Moscow, Mr. Orlov was consumed with grief and regret: Why hadn’t Memorial gotten her out sooner? Then he became angry.

“People ask me, who is guilty of this murder?” Mr. Orlov thundered at a news conference. “I know the name of this person. I know his title. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov. His title is president of the Chechen Republic.”

In Chechnya, Mr. Kadyrov denied that he had anything to do with the killing, and promised to personally lead the search for the killers. Even so, he publicly belittled Ms. Estemirova and Memorial.

“Why would Kadyrov kill a woman whom no one cared about?” Mr. Kadyrov said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in August 2009. “She never had any honor, dignity or a conscience. Never.”

On Chechen television, he later referred to Memorial with the kind of language that the Soviet Union used when persecuting dissidents. “They are not my opponents — they are enemies of the people, enemies of the law, enemies of the state,” Mr. Kadyrov said.

Mr. Kadyrov would not be interviewed for this article. His aides said he had made his views clear in court papers.

Mr. Kadyrov first brought a civil lawsuit against Mr. Orlov, and less than three months after the murder, a judge ruled in Mr. Kadyrov’s favor. Memorial and Mr. Orlov were ordered to publish an official retraction of the charges against Mr. Kadyrov on Memorial’s Web site, and pay roughly $2,300 in damages.

At Mr. Kadyrov’s behest, prosecutors then indicted Mr. Orlov on criminal defamation charges.

At the trial this fall, Mr. Kadyrov’s lawyer, Mr. Krasnenkov, has suggested that Memorial menaced Mr. Kadyrov, not the other way around. Mr. Krasnenkov forcefully questioned a colleague of Ms. Estemirova, Aleksandr V. Cherkasov.

Mr. Krasnenkov: “Are you aware of physical threats toward Ramzan Kadyrov — or threats to kill him — heard from the very lips of one of the staff members of Memorial?”

Mr. Cherkasov: “I know nothing about that.”

Mr. Krasnenkov: “Can you guarantee that Memorial does not have a special group that exerts psychological and physical pressure on people whom Memorial is displeased with? Yes or no!”

Mr. Cherkasov: “Of course, I can. It’s strange for me to hear such a thing.”

Outside court, Mr. Krasnenkov said in an interview that a guilty verdict should compel the F.S.B., the main successor to the K.G.B., to close down Memorial. He said he hoped that Mr. Kadyrov’s stance against Memorial would encourage other Russian politicians to not only file civil lawsuits over unjust criticism, but also seek criminal charges.

“They should do this for the sake of preserving the reputation of the state,” Mr. Krasnenkov said.

Mr. Kadyrov has not yet testified in the case, but he may do so in January. The judge is expected to hand down a verdict soon after.

In the meantime, the inquiry into Ms. Estemirova’s murder continues, including into who ordered it.

Law enforcement authorities now maintain that the actual killer was an Islamic extremist who was shot to death by the police in autumn 2009. They say they located the weapon used to kill Ms. Estemirova next to an identification document with the extremist’s picture on it.

Mr. Orlov described that determination as a farcical attempt to pin her murder on a dead man — an insurgent, no less.

Mr. Orlov made a formal request to the authorities: If they have ruled out involvement by government officials in Ms. Estemirova’s death, then they should release the case file showing that they examined that theory. The request was denied."
176,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"The people start trudging in at dawn, more than a thousand every day, exhausted, sick and starving, materializing out of the thin desert air to take their places at the gates of the world’s largest refugee camp, here in northern Kenya.

They are fleeing one of the worst droughts in Somalia in 60 years and many have walked for weeks through an anarchic landscape replete with bandits and militants but little food.

By the time they get here, many can barely stand or talk or swallow. Some mothers have even shown up with the bodies of shriveled babies strapped to their backs.

Abdio Ali Elmoi clutches her son, Mustapha, whose eyes are dimming. Her face is grooved with grief. She has already lost three children to gaajo, or hunger, a common word around here.

“I walked all day and all night,” she whispered, barely able to speak. “Where I come from, there is no food.”

Somalia is once again spewing misery across its borders, and once again man-made dimensions are making this natural disaster more acute.

The Islamist militants controlling southern Somalia forced out Western aid organizations last year, yanking away the only safety net just when the soil was drying up and the drought was coming. Only now, when the scale of the catastrophe is becoming clear, with nearly three million Somalis in urgent need and more than 10 million at risk across the parched Horn of Africa, have the militants relented and invited aid groups back. But few are rushing in because of the complications and dangers of dealing with a brutal group that is aligned with Al Qaeda and has turned Somalia into a focal point of American concerns on terrorism.

The Somalis are not waiting. Tens of thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands, are now fleeing to Kenya and Ethiopia for help, but the Kenyan government says it is overwhelmed and has been blocking the United Nations from opening a new $15 million camp here in Dadaab that could help absorb the influx.

Everything is in place to house 40,000 more refugees — new water towers, new latrines, new office blocks and perfectly straight rows of new mud-brick houses that look sturdy enough to live in for years. But that is precisely what the Kenyans fear.

As many as 380,000 people already live in the amalgam of camps that make up Dadaab (it was intended to hold 90,000), and the Kenyans worry that Somalis will continue flocking here and never go home, given the perennial turmoil in their country since the central government collapsed in 1991.

“Personally, I’ve done what I could,” said Gerald Otieno Kajwang’, Kenya’s immigration minister. “But the numbers coming in are too large that they threaten our security.”

The Kenyan government has been facing intense pressure to open the new camp, and several Western aid officials contended that the Kenyans were simply trying to extract more money from Western allies before relenting. On Friday, Kenyan officials indicated that the camp would open soon, but the delay has stranded thousands of refugees on the outskirts of Dadaab in the desert, increasingly far from hospitals, clean water or latrines, many with sick children curled up under trees.

“It’s shocking,” said Alexandra Lopoukhine, a spokeswoman for CARE, an aid group working in Dadaab.

Those who make it to one of the few hospitals in the camps might have a chance. The pediatric ward in the Dagahaley section is a fluorescent-lighted purgatory. Dozens of wizened children lie on rough wool blankets — nurses say probably fewer than half will make it — their skin slack, their eyes glassy, their heads far too big for their bodies. Many have IVs taped to the sides of their skulls.

“Vascular collapse,” explained a Kenyan doctor. “We couldn’t find a vein anywhere else.”

Isak Abdi Saney, a destitute farmer, is on a death watch. He gently lifts up the shirt on his 6-month-old son. Every rib shows, beneath skin as translucent as rice paper. Every breath looks as if it could be his last.

Because it is so difficult and dangerous for outsiders to even visit areas controlled by the Shabab militant group, it is hard to gauge the full depth of this drought. Somalia seems to be perpetually on the brink. With a shattered economy, no functioning central government and aid flows blocked, countless Somalis starve every year.

But according to a famine monitoring program financed by the United States, “over the past year, the eastern Horn of Africa has experienced consecutive poor rainy seasons, resulting in one of the driest years since 1950-1951 in many pastoral zones.”

The years of conflict — and recent increases in food prices — have depleted Somalia’s ability to withstand it. Thousands of people are leaving relatively uneventful rural areas to seek refuge even in Mogadishu, Somalia’s bullet-riddled capital, which has experienced a mass exodus for years because of fighting between the shaky government and Islamist militants.

The route to Dadaab, which lies about 50 miles inside Kenya’s border, is especially perilous, winding through one of the most unforgiving environments in the world. Refugees have been marauded, raped and killed by the various armed groups that haunt the land. Most arrive here penniless and demoralized. Many parents said they buried children along the way.

Some die just within reach of finally getting help. Right in front of a reception area at the camp are dozens of freshly dug graves.

Once proud young men find themselves sitting in the dirt, waiting to be registered. Life as a refugee is humiliating, especially in a culture that prizes independence. The first step is clawing through a crowd to get a cup of flour and some glucose biscuits. Then comes registration, getting fingerprinted twice, photographed, logged in, cataloged. Kenyan government workers scurry around, wearing blue surgical masks and polo shirts that say “Refugees Are Real People.”

Somali refugees are typically not allowed to work in Kenya, and without special permission they are not supposed to leave the camp. Dadaab is a place to warehouse people, often for years. Aid workers predict the numbers here could soon swell to half a million, sprawled across miles of scrub brush.

“I never thought I’d lose all my cattle,” said Abdi Farah Hassan, who looked visibly uncomfortable in line to be photographed. “I never thought I’d be a refugee.”"
177,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"The girl’s voice dropped to a hush as she remembered the bright, sunny afternoon when she stepped out of her hut and saw her best friend buried in the sand, up to her neck.

Her friend had made the mistake of refusing to marry a Shabab commander. Now she was about to get her head bashed in, rock by rock.

“You’re next,” the Shabab warned the girl, a frail 17-year-old who was living with her brother in a squalid refugee camp.

Several months later, the men came back. Five militants burst into her hut, pinned her down and gang-raped her, she said. They claimed to be on a jihad, or holy war, and any resistance was considered a crime against Islam, punishable by death.

“I’ve had some very bad dreams about these men,” she said, having recently escaped the area they control. “I don’t know what religion they are.”

Somalia has been steadily worn down by decades of conflict and chaos, its cities in ruins and its people starving. Just this year, tens of thousands have died from famine, with countless others cut down in relentless combat. Now Somalis face yet another widespread terror: an alarming increase in rapes and sexual abuse of women and girls.

The Shabab militant group, which presents itself as a morally righteous rebel force and the defender of pure Islam, is seizing women and girls as spoils of war, gang-raping and abusing them as part of its reign of terror in southern Somalia, according to victims, aid workers and United Nations officials. Short of cash and losing ground, the militants are also forcing families to hand over girls for arranged marriages that often last no more than a few weeks and are essentially sexual slavery, a cheap way to bolster their ranks’ flagging morale.

But it is not just the Shabab. In the past few months, aid workers and victims say, there has been a free-for-all of armed men preying upon women and girls displaced by Somalia’s famine, who often trek hundreds of miles searching for food and end up in crowded, lawless refugee camps where Islamist militants, rogue militiamen and even government soldiers rape, rob and kill with impunity.

With the famine putting hundreds of thousands of women on the move — severing them from their traditional protection mechanism, the clan — aid workers say more Somali women are being raped right now than at any time in recent memory. In some areas, they say, women are being used as chits at roadblocks, surrendered to the gunmen staffing the barrier in the road so that a group of desperate refugees can pass.

“The situation is intensifying,” said Radhika Coomaraswamy, the United Nations’ special representative for children and armed conflict. All the recent flight has created a surge in opportunistic rapes, she said, and “for the Shabab, forced marriage is another aspect they are using to control the population.”

In the past two months, from Mogadishu alone, the United Nations says it has received more than 2,500 reports of gender-based violence, an unusually large number here. But because Somalia is a no-go zone for most operations, United Nations officials say they are unable to confirm the reports, leaving the work to fledgling Somali aid organizations under constant threat.

Somalia is a deeply traditional place, where 98 percent of girls are subject to genital cutting, according to United Nations figures. Most girls are illiterate and relegated to their homes. When they venture out, it is usually to work, trudging through the rubble-strewn alleyways wrapped head to toe in thick black cloth, often lugging something on their back, the equatorial sun burning down on them.

The famine and mass displacement, which began over the summer, have made women and girls more vulnerable. Many Somali communities have been disbanded, and with armed groups forcing men and boys into their militias, it is often single women, with children in tow, who set off on the dangerous odyssey to refugee camps.

At the same time, aid workers and United Nations officials say the Shabab, who are fighting Somalia’s transitional government and imposing a harsh version of Islam in the areas they control, can no longer pay their several thousand fighters the way they used to. Much as they seize crops and livestock, giving their militants what they call “temporary wives” is how the Shabab keep many young men fighting for them.

But these are hardly marriages, said Sheik Mohamed Farah Ali, a former Shabab commander who defected to the government army.

“There’s no cleric, no ceremony, nothing,” he said, adding that Shabab fighters had even paired up with thin little girls as young as 12, who are left torn and incontinent afterward. If a girl refuses, he said, “she’s killed by stones or bullets.”

One young woman just delivered a baby, half Somali, half Arab. She said she was selected by a Somali Shabab fighter she knew, brought to a house full of guns and handed off to a portly Arab commander, one of the many foreigners fighting for the Shabab.

“He did whatever he wanted with me,” she said. “Night and day.”

She said she escaped when he was sleeping.

The Elman Peace and Human Rights Center is one of the few Somali organizations helping rape victims, run by Fartuun Adan, a tall, outspoken woman whose husband, Elman, was gunned down by warlords years ago. Ms. Adan says that since the famine began, she has met hundreds of women who have been raped and hundreds more who have escaped forced marriages.

“You have no idea how difficult it is for them to come forward,” she said. “There’s no justice here, no protection. People say, ‘You’re junk’ if you’ve been raped.”

Often, the women are left wounded or pregnant, forced to seek help. Ms. Adan wants to expand her medical services and counseling for rape victims and possibly open a safe house, but it is hard to do on a budget of $5,000 a month, provided by a small aid organization called Sister Somalia. Ms. Adan wept on a recent day as she listened to the 17-year-old girl recount the story of seeing her friend stoned to death and then being gang-raped herself.

“These girls ask me, ‘How am I going to get married, what’s going to be my future, what’s going to happen to me?’ ” she said. “We can’t answer that.”

Some of the women in Ms. Adan’s office seem to have come from another time. They have made it here, with help from Elman’s network, from the deepest recesses of rural Somalia, where women are still treated like chattel.

One 18-year-old who asked to go by Ms. Nur, her common last name, was married off at 10. She was a nomad and says that to this day she has never used a phone or seen a television.

She spoke of being raped by two Shabab fighters at a displaced-persons camp in October. She said the men did not bother saying much when they entered her hut. They just pointed their guns at her chest and uttered two words: stay silent."
178,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"Benadir Hospital is a chunky block of a building in downtown Mogadishu, built in the 1970s by the Chinese. It has cracked windows, ceiling fans that don’t turn and long, ghostly hallways that stink of human excrement and diesel fuel — all that the nurses have to wash the floors. Each morning, legions of starving people trudge in, the victims of Somalia’s spreading famine. Many have journeyed from hundreds of miles away. They spent every last dollar and every last calorie to make it here, and when they arrive, they simply collapse on the floor. Benadir’s few doctors and nurses are all volunteers and all exhausted, and many wear tattered, bloodied smocks. The minute I walked in, I had a bad feeling I would find what I was looking for.

As the East Africa correspondent for The New York Times, my assignment has been to chronicle the current famine in Somalia, one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the last two decades, hitting one of the most forlorn and troubled countries in modern times. My job is to seek out the suffering and write about it and to analyze the causes and especially the response, which has been woefully inadequate by all accounts, though not totally hopeless.

In Benadir, there is a room full of old blue cots, one after another, where the sickest children lie. On each bed, a little life is passing away. Some children cry, but most are quiet. The skin on their feet and hands is peeling off. All their bones show, like skeletons covered in parchment. I was standing just a few feet away from Kufow Ali Abdi, a destitute nomad, as he looked down on his dying daughter, and when the time came, there was no mystery, no fuss.

I watched Mr. Kufow carefully unhook the I.V. that was attached to her shriveled body and then wrap her up in blue cloth. Her name was Kadija and she was 3 years old and probably not more than 20 pounds. Mr. Kufow walked out of the room, lightly carrying Kadija’s body in his arms.

At least five children died that day in Benadir. At a camp not far away, where people are housed in twig huts and stare listlessly at the road, hoping for an aid truck to arrive, I was told that 10 had died. Across Somalia, it’s hundreds a day.

Much of Africa, Somalia in particular, has had a tough time since independence in the 1960s, becoming synonymous with staggering levels of misery and leading many people to simply shrug and mutter “here we go again” when they hear of a new drought or a new war. But this current crisis in Somalia is on a different order of magnitude than the typical calamity, if there is such a thing. Tens of thousands of people have already died, and as many as 750,000 could soon starve to death, the United Nations says, the equivalent of the entire populations of Miami and Pittsburgh.

One reason the situation has gotten this grim is that most of the big Western aid agencies and charities, the ones with the technical expertise and so-called surge capacity to rapidly distribute aid, have been blocked from working in the famine zones. At a time when Somalia is suffering from the worst drought in 60 years, a ruthless militant group called the Shabab, which is essentially a Qaeda franchise, is on such an anti-Western tirade that it has banned Western music, Western dress, soccer, bras and even Western food aid. The Shabab are a heavily armed complication that differentiates this crisis from previous famines in Somalia, Ethiopia or Sudan and from other recent natural disasters like the tsunami in Indonesia or Haiti’s earthquake, where aid groups were able to rush in and start saving lives within a matter of hours.

That said, it is not as if American or European aid agencies are simply giving up on Somalia. It’s the opposite. They’re stepping up operations and scrambling to find ways to get around the Shabab restrictions, turning to new technologies like sending electronic money by cellphone so people in famine zones can buy food themselves from local markets.

Western charities are also teaming up with the new players on the aid scene, like Turkish groups and other Muslim organizations that are allowed into Shabab areas. It all calls for more hustle and definitely more imagination: in Somalia there are a million impediments to the aid business — the Shabab, the broken-down state, dilapidated ports and airports, American government sanctions, a legacy of corruption and the sheer dangers of working in full-fledged anarchy haunted by militias, warlords, glassy-eyed gunmen and even 21st-century pirates. But charity groups say they are beginning to turn this famine around. They just need more resources and more time.

“One thing is clear,” said Elhadj AsSy, a Unicef official. “With continued support from our donors and partners, our combined efforts to save lives, livelihoods and ways of life will make a difference.”

But support — meaning dollars — has been frustratingly scant. While many more lives are at stake in Somalia’s crisis, other recent disasters pulled in far more money. For instance, Save the Children U.S. has raised a little more than $5 million in private donations for the Horn of Africa crisis, which includes Somalia and the drought-inflicted areas of Kenya and Ethiopia. That contrasts with what Save the Children raised in 2004 for the Indonesian tsunami ($55.4 million) or the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 ($28.2 million) or even the earthquake in Japan earlier this year ($22.8 million) — and Japan is a rich country.

“Americans are incredibly generous when they understand that children are in desperate need,” said Carolyn Miles, president of Save the Children. “If they knew millions of children were facing death in East Africa, I believe they would give. But I don’t think Americans understand the scale of this disaster.”

Rachel Wolff, a spokeswoman for World Vision, explained that “rapid-onset disasters,” like a sudden earthquake, tend to get more attention and more donations. And Somalia’s crisis was hardly rapid. This was a catastrophe 20 years in the making.

The central government collapsed in 1991, pulled down by clan warlords who then turned on one another and plunged Somalia into anarchy. The hospitals are now shot-up wrecks, the roads are abysmal and the airports and ports barely function, complicating the efforts to bring in life-saving supplies. Somalia’s economy has been so shattered by war that there are few paying jobs, which leads to the pilfering of humanitarian aid, another serious problem here, because the black market of stolen food aid has blossomed into one of the country’s few moneymaking industries, along with, of course, piracy.

Farms are ruined and much of the food Somalis survive on is imported, leaving them highly vulnerable to swings in global food prices, which are near record highs. Somalia is also probably one of the most violent countries on the planet. Whenever I come, I have to hire my own private mini-army to guard me, usually 10 to 15 gunmen, who start shadowing me the minute I step off the plane. Many aid workers have been killed or kidnapped in Somalia, which has scared aid organizations away.

“We are beyond frustrated to not be able to reach children who are dying, not be able to fulfill our humanitarian mandate within the worst-hit areas of the Horn drought crisis,” said Mrs. Wolff of World Vision, which the Shabab has banned. “Since February, when we warned of the drought crisis, we have been exploring various options but do not have a breakthrough solution at this point.”

In the other crises I’ve covered, there’s a certain routine: check in with the United Nations upon arrival, get a security briefing, take an aid worker out for a drink and then, come next morning, hitch a ride to the field in an aid agency Land Cruiser with the name stenciled on the side.

In refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan or the many besieged Congolese towns I’ve worked in, it’s hard not to stumble across other Westerners, many wearing mesh vests emblazoned with the name of their organization or the acronyms — Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, Unicef, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Rescue Committee, War Child — overseeing food deliveries, taking surveys or slipping a feeding tube up the nose of a starving child. But in Somalia, these big agencies are virtually absent.

The day a photographer and I visited the Badbaado camp in Mogadishu, many people thought we were the aid workers. We passed rows of tiny huts built literally out of sticks and rags, stepping over piles of human waste because these camps of starving people have sprouted up so fast there are few latrines, water taps or any real planning, and we met one emaciated person after another. They stumbled forward, sometimes hugging me for support or pulling the tight skin at their throats to show they were starving. One man reached out and jerked my arm.

“Look!” he said, pointing to a small bundle in the corner of his tent. I peered in. It was the corpse of his 2-year-old son, Suleiman, who had just died.

I heard many bad stories about the Shabab in these camps. Most people here fled Shabab zones, often starting out their journey with five or six children and arriving in Mogadishu with just one or two left. There is nothing else they can do. They either buried their children along the way or left them dying under a tree.

People told me the Shabab were trying to prevent anyone from leaving and that Shabab fighters had even set up special camps where thousands of exhausted, hungry and sick people were corralled at gunpoint, an ideal breeding ground for disease, especially because the Shabab have also banned immunizations. It’s the perfect storm to kill countless children. Measles, typhoid and cholera are already beginning to sweep through the camps. Epidemiologists predict that the fatalities will shoot up and thousands of people will perish when the heavy rains come in November and December, spreading waterborne diseases.

Ken Menkhaus, a political science professor at Davidson College who has been working as a consultant on Somalia since the early 1990s, said the Shabab had pushed Somalia to a tipping point.

“The worst-case scenario is a Khmer Rouge situation where a group with a twisted ideology presides over the mass death of its own people,” he said. “The numbers are going to be horrifying.”

There have been some rumblings by Ethiopia and others of strengthening the current African Union peace-keeping force in Somalia and trying to blast out the Shabab so more aid can reach starving people. But the United States and the other nations with the necessary resources don’t want to get dragged back into Somalia, which was the scene of a botched peace-keeping mission in the 1990s.

But this famine isn’t all about the Shabab. Even in the few government-controlled zones, people are suffering on a shocking scale. Western donors, including the United States, have poured millions of dollars into Somalia’s Transitional Federal Government, a divided, unpopular collection of politicians and former warlords based in Mogadishu, Somalia’s bullet-riddled capital. American officials have branded the T.F.G., as it is known, as the best bulwark against the Shabab. But many analysts say the T.F.G. has performed dismally in responding to the famine (and to the Shabab), and in recent weeks, government militias have looted food and shot starving people.

The government’s weaknesses have spawned the advent of more than 20 independent mini-states seeking to rule themselves. Most of these are formed by members of the same clan — the building block of Somali society — and are loose organizations of a few politicians and some gunmen. In a time of famine, it’s a bit overwhelming for aid groups to deal with all these new entities.

In August, I flew with World Vision to visit Dolo, a small town on the Ethiopia-Somalia border controlled by a local militia. We took off from Nairobi at dawn, cruising over vast tracts of uninhabited, desiccated scrub brush, and landed on a dirt airstrip three hours later. Stick-thin militiamen dressed in camouflage uniforms that hung loose off their bony shoulders squinted at us as we stepped off the plane. We climbed into dusty trucks and sped off to see the district commissioner, Dolo’s boss.

The district commissioner’s office was a twig hut with a plastic tarp for a roof and sand for a floor. I think the man could read, but that was about it — he told us he had barely gone to school, didn’t have any money and was struggling to handle the ceaseless flood of starving people pouring into his area. Just a few steps from his office I met a woman sitting on an empty wooden box along the road, with four very thin children. They had just arrived from a Shabab area, and the woman said that what little food was being distributed through the International Committee of the Red Cross was getting stolen by Shabab fighters.

“They’re starving, too,” she said.

The World Vision team made a quick survey of conditions in the town, leaving Chris Smoot, the Somalia country director, almost in tears.

“I see a community that doesn’t know how to cope,” Mr. Smoot said. “They’re cut off, this little island of whatever.”

We landed back in Nairobi by nightfall, proof of another problem: few foreign aid workers who work on Somalia actually spend much time in Somalia. Just about all the embassies and aid agencies run their Somali operations by remote control from Nairobi, relying on local staffs and updates by phone and e-mail, because it’s too dangerous for foreigners to linger in Somalia for more than a few hours (unless you’re a journalist with your own mini-army). One of the consequences of this arm’s-length approach is an inevitable lack of oversight, which has precipitated scandals like accusations against the World Food Program that as much as half of the emergency food intended for needy people in Somalia is being stolen by corrupt United Nations contractors and sold on the open market; some of the proceeds are said to be going to the Shabab, who then use the money for guns.

The accusations have never been definitively proved. But just their possibility prompted the American government to slap heavy restrictions on aid to Somalia, which remain in place now, even during the famine. American officials recently indicated that they had relaxed some of the restrictions, but aid agencies said it was still difficult to determine what was legal and what was not.

“The uncertainties around what we’re allowed to do in southern Somalia, and with whom, create a chilling effect for aid groups who would otherwise want to respond,” explained Jeremy Konyndyk, a director of policy and advocacy for Mercy Corps.

All this might easily lead one to conclude that Somalia is beyond hope and that hundreds of thousands of people are going to die, no matter what. But that’s not true. Aid agencies are making progress, though the situation is far from ideal. I constantly get e-mails asking: what can I do to help?

I try not to pick favorites, and I give the best picture I can, which is constantly changing, of who is doing what in response to this famine. The Shabab are mercurial, letting in some big aid groups but not others. Unicef, for example, is one of the few United Nations agencies able to do some work in Shabab areas, supporting feeding centers and medical clinics, but all through Somali staff. The World Food Program is distributing food in the Mogadishu camps, but once again there are myriad accusations of aid being stolen.

Smaller aid agencies definitely have more flexibility. For instance, the only Western aid worker I saw during a recent trip to Dhobley, a wild, militia-controlled town on the Somalia-Kenya border, was a burly Australian with a white Hemingway-esque beard who was working for the American Refugee Committee. It’s a private aid agency that has sent several foreigners into Somalia to oversee sanitation and cash-for-work projects.

Kenya and Ethiopia host more than 600,000 Somali refugees, and many of the major aid organizations, like CARE, Doctors Without Borders, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children, are running programs in camps in these two countries. Inside Somalia, many aid groups are embracing the approach of cash transfers by cellphone as a way to get around the Shabab and deliver aid directly — and discreetly — to poor people. It is early days yet, but it seems to be working.

Muslim charities, like Islamic Relief and several Turkish aid agencies, are playing an increasingly large role in this crisis, because the Shabab continue to allow them much more access to drought zones than the Western groups. Somali organizations, like Saacid, are also helping feed people, though the local charities are often undermanned and underfinanced.

It is important to remember that however plagued Somalia is, however routine conflict, drought and disease have become, however many Somalis have already needlessly died, Somalis are not somehow wired differently from the rest of us. They are not numb to suffering. They are not grief-proof. I’ll never forget the expression on Mr. Kufow’s face as he stumbled out of Benadir Hospital into the penetrating sunshine with his lifeless little girl in his arms. He may not have been weeping openly. But he looked as if he could barely breathe."
179,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"Adan Dahir Hassan sits in a bald office, wires dangling from the ceiling, handing out death sentences. Recently installed by an Islamist warlord, Mr. Hassan recalled how he had ordered a soldier who had killed a civilian, possibly by accident, to be delivered to the victim’s family, which promptly shot him in the head.

“It’s Islamic law,” said Mr. Hassan, the professed district commissioner of this bullet-riddled town. “That’s what makes the community feel happy.”

For the first time in years, the Shabab Islamist group that has long tormented Somalis is receding from several areas at once, including this one, handing the Transitional Federal Government an enormous opportunity to finally step outside the capital and begin uniting this fractious country after two decades of war.

Instead, a messy, violent, clannish scramble is emerging over who will take control.

But the government is too weak, corrupt, divided and disorganized to mount a claim beyond Mogadishu, the capital, leaving clan warlords, Islamist militias and proxy forces armed by foreign governments to battle it out for the regions the Shabab are losing.

Already, clashes have erupted between the anti-Shabab forces fighting for the spoils, and roadblocks operated by clan militias have resurfaced on the streets of Mogadishu, even though the government says it is in control. Many analysts say both the Shabab and the government are splintering and predict that the warfare will only increase, complicating the response to Somalia’s widening famine.

“What you now have is a free-for-all contest in which clans are unilaterally carving up the country into unviable clan enclaves and cantons,” said Rashid Abdi, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, which studies conflicts. “The way things are going, the risk of future interregional wars and instability is real,” Mr. Abdi added, “even after Al Shabab is defeated.”

More than 20 separate new ministates, including one for a drought-stricken area incongruously named Greenland, have sprouted up across Somalia, some little more than Web sites or so-called briefcase governments, others heavily armed, all eager for international recognition and the money that may come with it.

Officials with the 9,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force, the backbone of security in Mogadishu, say they are deeply concerned by this fragmentation, reminiscent of Somalia’s warlord days after the government collapsed in 1991.

“What was holding everybody together is now gone,” lamented an African Union official, who asked not to be identified because he was departing from the official line that all is well in Mogadishu. “All these people who came together to fight the Shabab are now starting to fight each other. We weren’t prepared for this. It’s happening too fast.”

American officials are struggling to keep up with Somalia’s rapidly evolving — or some say devolving — politics, saying they have lost faith in the transitional government’s leaders and are now open to the idea of financing some local security forces, part of what they call a “dual track” approach to supporting the national and local governments at the same time.

“It wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world to have a local leader with some charisma and grass-roots support,” said one American official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Perhaps no area better illustrates the creeping warlordism than Dhobley, a forlorn little town near the Kenyan border contested by two new militias, one led by a dapper, French-educated intellectual, the other by an Islamist sheik who used to be in league with the Shabab.

People are starving here, victims of Somalia’s famine, 70-pound adults and tiny babies with skin cracked like old paint. But there are few aid organizations around. They have been scared off by the hundreds of undisciplined militiamen, who constantly fire off their guns and have killed each other in recent weeks.

The gunmen in solid green fatigues belong to Ahmed Madobe, the Islamist sheik-turned-warlord who just a few years ago was hunted down by American forces, wounded by shrapnel during an air raid and then spirited away to an Ethiopian prison.

“I wasn’t just in the Shabab; I helped found it,” Sheik Madobe boasted the other day, as he sat in a tent on Dhobley’s outskirts, flanked by dozens of baby-faced fighters. He said he had quit the Shabab because “they’re killers,” though several analysts said it was a more prosaic breakup over smuggling fees.

Also prowling around Dhobley, between crumbling buildings and stinking piles of animal carcasses from the drought, are hundreds of gunmen in camouflage fighting for another man, known as the Professor.

Mohamed Abdi Mohamed, better known as Professor Gandhi, is a former university lecturer who says he holds two French Ph.D.’s — in geology and anthropology. He has formed his own state, Azania, complete with two houses of representatives and special seats for women, though he is not actually in Dhobley and seems to spend a lot of time in Kenya.

“Let’s just say Madobe and I have different values,” Professor Gandhi said from the tearoom of a fancy hotel in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, where he was wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a stylish thick cotton blazer.

Professor Gandhi’s and Sheik Madobe’s forces, working simultaneously though not quite together, recently pushed the Shabab out of a few towns along the Kenyan border. The Kenyan military has been backing them up, and according to American diplomatic cables, the Chinese government gave Kenya weapons and uniforms for the Somali militiamen, possibly because there is oil in southern Somalia that the Chinese covet.

A similar situation is unfolding near the Ethiopian border, where an Ethiopian-backed militia has defeated Shabab forces and established a narrow zone of control. In central Somalia, another militia, Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a, which also receives Ethiopian weapons, has seized several towns from the Shabab as well.

The Shabab seem to be undercut by internal fissures, though they still have thousands of fighters. Several leaders, including Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, have recently been killed, and the Shabab’s policy of blocking Western food aid at a time of famine has meant that hundreds of thousands of people have fled their territory, depleting the militants’ resources and depriving them of recruits. Those who remain are often too poor to tax or too sick to soldier.

In August, the Shabab announced they were pulling out of Mogadishu for the first time in years, though some fighters apparently stayed behind to terrorize the population and behead more than a dozen people.

The new anti-Shabab forces have differing relationships with the transitional government. Sheik Madobe says he is willing to work with transitional leaders; Professor Gandhi dismissed them as a lost cause. But even the local administrations marginally aligned with the government say they do not get much help from Mogadishu and now want to break away.

“Separation, that’s our dream,” said Abdirashid Hassan Abdinur, a local official in Dolo, near the Ethiopian border. As for a name, he said they were still working on that. “All I can say is that we’ll pick it here, not at some foreign hotel.”"
180,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan," The Shabab Islamist insurgent group, which controls much of southern Somalia, is blocking starving people from fleeing the country and setting up a cantonment camp where it is imprisoning displaced people who were trying to escape Shabab territory.

The group is widely blamed for causing a famine in Somalia by forcing out many Western aid organizations, depriving drought victims of desperately needed food. The situation is growing bleaker by the day, with tens of thousands of Somalis already dead and more than 500,000 children on the brink of starvation.

Every morning, emaciated parents with emaciated children stagger into Banadir Hospital, a shell of a building with floors that stink of diesel fuel because that is all the nurses have to fight off the flies. Babies are dying because of the lack of equipment and medicine. Some get hooked up to adult-size intravenous drips — pediatric versions are hard to find — and their compromised bodies cannot handle the volume of fluid.

Most parents do not have money for medicine, so entire families sit on old-fashioned cholera beds, with basketball-size holes cut out of the middle, taking turns going to the bathroom as diarrhea streams out of them.

“This is worse than 1992,” said Dr. Lul Mohamed, Banadir’s head of pediatrics, referring to Somalia’s last famine. “Back then, at least we had some help.”

Aid groups are trying to scale up their operations, and the United Nations has begun airlifting emergency food. But many seasoned aid officials are speaking in grim tones because one of Africa’s worst humanitarian disasters in decades has struck one of the most inaccessible countries on earth. Somalia, especially the southern third where the famine is, has been considered a no-go zone for years, a lawless caldron that has claimed the lives of dozens of aid workers, peacekeepers and American soldiers, going back to the “Black Hawk Down” battle in 1993, spelling a legacy that has scared off many international organizations.

“If this were Haiti, we would have dozens of people on the ground by now,” said Eric James, an official with the American Refugee Committee, a private aid organization.

But Somalia is considered more dangerous and anarchic than Haiti, Iraq or even Afghanistan, and the American Refugee Committee, like other aid groups, is struggling to get trained personnel here.

“It is safe to say that many people are going to die as a result of little or no access,” Mr. James said.

This leaves millions of famished Somalis with two choices, aside from fleeing the country to neighboring Kenya or Ethiopia, where there is more assistance. They can beg for help from a weak and divided transitional government in Mogadishu, the capital. Just the other day there was a shootout between government forces at the gates of the presidential palace. “Things happen,” was the response of Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Somalia’s new prime minister.

Or they can remain in territory controlled by the Shabab, who have pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda and have tried to rid their areas of anything Western — Western music, Western dress, even Western aid groups during a time of famine.

Much of the Horn of Africa, which includes Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti, has been struck this summer by one of the worst droughts in 60 years. But two Shabab-controlled parts of southern Somalia are the only areas where the United Nations has declared a famine, using scientific criteria of death and malnutrition rates.

People from those areas who were interviewed in Mogadishu say Shabab fighters are blocking rivers to steal water from impoverished villagers and divert it to commercial farmers who pay them taxes. The Shabab are intercepting displaced people who are trying to reach Mogadishu and forcing them to stay in a Shabab-run camp about 25 miles outside the city. The camp now holds several thousand people and receives only a trickle of food.

“I was taken off a bus and put here,” said a woman at the camp who asked not to be identified.

Several drought victims who have succeeded in making it to Mogadishu said that the Shabab were threatening to kill anyone who left their areas, either for refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia, or for government zones in Somalia, and that the only way out was to sneak away at night and avoid the main roads.

A few years ago, the Shabab began banning immunizations, deeming them a Western plot to kill Somali children. Now countless unvaccinated children are dying from measles and cholera as tens of thousands of malnourished, immunity-suppressed people flee the drought areas and pack into filthy, crowded camps.

The other day, Kufow Ali Abdi, a destitute herder who lost all his cattle, trudged out of Banadir Hospital, gently carrying a small package in his arms wrapped in blue cloth. It looked almost like a swaddled newborn but it was the opposite. It was the body of his 3-year-old daughter, Kadija, who had just succumbed to measles.

“I just hope they can save the others,” he said, referring to his two remaining children, down to skin and bone.

The magnitude of suffering could shift the political landscape, which has been dominated by chaos since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew the central government and then tore apart the country. The Transitional Federal Government — the 15th attempt at a government — is trying to assert itself and beat back the Shabab, and the famine and attendant relief effort could mean an enormous opportunity.

“It could be a face-lift for them, an opportunity to deliver services and show they are committed,” said Sheik Abdulkadir, a militia leader. “But if a lot of people die here, people will say it’s the government’s fault.”

The famine could affect the Shabab as well, deepening the fissures in their organization. Shabab leaders are now beginning to cut their own deals in the face of mass starvation. Unicef recently delivered a planeload of food and medicine to Baidoa, a Shabab stronghold. In Xarardheere, another Shabab-controlled town and a notorious pirate den, a Shabab commander said in an interview on Saturday that he would welcome Western aid organizations despite the anti-Western policies imposed by his leadership, which has been hit by the deaths of several prominent figures recently.

Sheik Yoonis, a Shabab spokesman, said in an e-mail that the declaration of a famine was “an exaggeration.” He said that Shabab fighters were not imprisoning people in the camp, but that the people were attracted to it by “this sense of serenity and security.” He also denied that the Shabab were diverting river water or scaring away aid agencies.

Still, many aid organizations are reluctant to venture into Shabab areas because of the obvious dangers — the Shabab have killed dozens of aid workers — and because of American government restrictions. In 2008, the State Department declared the Shabab a terrorist group, making it a crime to provide material assistance to them. Aid officials say the restrictions have had a chilling effect because it is nearly impossible to guarantee that the Shabab will not skim off some of the aid delivered in their areas.

Even United Nations contractors have been accused of siphoning food aid, resulting in extensive investigations and cuts in life-saving assistance.

Western aid agencies are now trying to work through Islamic and local organizations as much as possible, but the Somali partners do not usually have as much technical expertise. And heavy fighting has erupted in Mogadishu again, making it dangerous even for Somali aid workers.

“Somalia is one of the most complicated places in the world to deliver aid, more complicated than Afghanistan,” said Stefano Porretti, who heads the World Food Progam’s efforts in Somalia and recently worked in Afghanistan."
181,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"When the first batch of African Union peacekeepers landed at Mogadishu’s decrepit airport in 2007, they were immediately shelled by insurgents with mortars and given little chance of success. This was Somalia after all, the graveyard of several other doomed interventions, and the African Union soldiers were a last resort for a deeply troubled mission.

But four years later and nearly 10,000 soldiers strong, the African Union force in Somalia has hardened into a war-fighting machine — and it seems to be winning the war. Analysts say the African Union has done a better job of pacifying Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital and a hornet’s nest of Islamist militants, clan warlords, factional armies and countless glassy-eyed freelance gunmen, than any other outside force, including 25,000 American troops in the 1990s.

The peacekeepers have “performed better than anyone would have dreamed,” said J. Peter Pham, director of the Africa program at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institution.

Their surprising success has put the African Union in the driver’s seat of an intensifying international effort to wipe out Somalia’s Shabab militants, once and for all. Kenya, Ethiopia, the United States, France, Djibouti, Burundi and Uganda have all jumped in to some degree against the Shabab, a brutal and wily insurgent group that is considered both a regional menace and an international threat, with possible sleeper cells embedded in Somali communities in the United States and Europe.

The Shabab have been terrorizing Somalia for years, imposing a harsh and alien form of Islam, chopping off heads and unleashing suicide bombers, including Somali-Americans recruited from Minnesota. But the African Union has dealt the Shabab a crippling blow in Mogadishu, which is what may have encouraged Kenyan and Ethiopian forces to recently invade separate parts of Somalia in an unusual regional effort to spread the Shabab thin on several fronts and methodically eliminate them.

But the Shabab are hardly giving up. Young, messianic insurgents are viciously resisting the African Union troops, sometimes fighting hand to hand, with both sides suffering heavy losses.

African Union officials, who have been reluctant to disclose casualties and in the past even provided apparently false accounting of the numbers, revealed that more than 500 soldiers had been killed in Somalia, making this peacekeeping mission one of the bloodiest of recent times.

Oct. 20 was a particularly bad day. Shortly after dawn, several hundred peacekeepers marched into Deynile, one of the last Shabab strongholds in Mogadishu.

“It started off easy, too easy,” groaned Cpl. Arcade Arakaza, a Burundian peacekeeper, from a hospital bed in Nairobi.

There was little resistance, with a few Shabab fighters fleeing in front of them. Civilians smiled from the bullet-riddled doorways, saying things like, “Don’t worry, Shabab finished.”

But suddenly the entire neighborhood opened up on the peacekeepers with assault rifles, belt-fed machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, “women, kids, everyone,” Corporal Arakaza said. It was a classic envelope trap, with the Shabab drawing the peacekeepers deeper into their lair, sealing off the escape routes and then closing in from all sides.

Dozens of peacekeepers were wounded, including Corporal Arakaza, who was shot through the groin, and more than 70 killed in the span of a few minutes. But the African Union soldiers clawed back, eventually capturing a chunk of Shabab territory.

Unlike the Americans, who hastily left Somalia after 18 soldiers were killed during the infamous Black Hawk Down debacle in 1993, or the United Nations mission that folded not long afterward, the African Union has pressed on. It plans to send thousands more young men from deeply impoverished sub-Saharan nations into the maw of Somalia, an arrangement that is lucrative for the governments of the contributing countries and the soldiers themselves — they each can make $1,000 a month as a peacekeeper compared with as little as $50 back home.

The American government is helping foot this bill, contributing more than $400 million. Even so, some American officials say the mission is underfinanced. They insist the African troops need better flak jackets, more armored trucks and helicopters. Many peacekeepers bled to death that day in Deynile because they had no way of being rescued.

“These guys are fighting and dying every day and there’s a national interest for us in Somalia,” one American official said. “It’s crazy we’re spending more money on Congo and Darfur,” home to enormous United Nations peacekeeping missions that in total cost the American government more than $1 billion per year, though neither place is considered strategically vital to the United States.

Few in Washington are optimistic about getting the African Union better equipment during a painful round of budget cuts at the Pentagon and State Department. While Darfur, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo have high-powered champions like Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who visited eastern Congo to spotlight the rape problem, or the countless celebrities who routinely tour Darfur, several American officials who work on Africa say there is not a strong lobby for Somalia in the White House.

The Pentagon has organized occasional Special Operations strikes to take out wanted Somali terrorist suspects — the Shabab have drawn increasingly close to Al Qaeda — and the American government is paying contractors to train African Union troops in the ABCs of urban combat. But the official American policy is no boots on the ground, which goes for the French as well, who have also bombed Shabab camps.

That leaves a dreary infantry war between the ill-equipped African peacekeepers, who come from Burundi and Uganda, with several hundred Djiboutians on their way, and the Shabab.

Sgt. Astere Nimbona, another Burundian peacekeeper, said that his unit had no armored personnel carriers or tanks on the day of the Deynile battle. He marched nine hours straight under the equatorial sun, lugging pounds of bullets and an empty canteen, before he stepped into the ambush.

“What we did was basically suicide,” he said.

The African Union has shifted from blasting Shabab areas with long-range artillery, which it did in the beginning, killing many civilians, to using foot patrols. They have now succeeded in securing most of Mogadishu, without making nearly as many enemies.

The peacekeepers may soon venture into Somalia’s famine-stricken hinterlands, where the Shabab have been blocking aid convoys from reaching starving people. There is also talk of bringing the Kenyan troops, and possibly the Ethiopian troops, under the green-and-white African Union flag.

But there is an uncomfortable bigger question. What will these African Union sacrifices amount to? All peacekeeping experts say the same thing: that peacekeepers are a Band-Aid on a gaping wound, a way to buy time until a political process takes hold and alleviates the causes of the conflict.

In Somalia, the political process seems as bleak as ever. The Transitional Federal Government, Somalia’s internationally recognized authority that the African Union protects, is a collection of corrupt politicians and warlords who control almost no territory and are exceedingly unpopular.

The government has yet to fix schools, open hospitals or deliver services in just about all the neighborhoods the African Union has wrested away from the Shabab in battles that often cost dozens of lives for a few crumbling city blocks."
182,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"Children with shrapnel wounds lie on metal hospital cots. Thousands of others have been huddling in caves and stony riverbeds, fleeing the fighter jets and bombers prowling the skies. Villages are empty, fields unplowed. At the faintest buzz of a plane, people scatter into the bush, in a panic.

“Just lie flat, or you could get killed,” warned Nagwa Musa Konda, the director of a local aid organization, as a plane growled closer.

Despite an agreement signed only days ago to bring peace to this part of central Sudan, it seems to be sliding inexorably toward war.

Young men here in the Nuba Mountains are being mobilized into militias, marching into the hills to train. All the cars in this area, including humanitarian vehicles, are smeared with thick mud to camouflage them from what residents describe as unrelenting bombings. And opposition forces vow to press their fight until they win some form of autonomy, undeterred by the government’s push to stamp them out.

“It’s going to be a long war,” said Ahmed Zakaria, a doctor from the Nuba Mountains who recently quit his job to become an opposition fighter. “We want a secular, democratic state where we can be free to rule ourselves. Like Kurdistan,” Dr. Zakaria said, smiling. “And we will fight for it.”

The conflict is overshadowing one of the biggest events in Sudan’s history: the independence of the southern part of the country and the creation of two Sudans. In just over a week, southern Sudan will officially break off from the north, the capstone of decades of civil war and years of international negotiations to stave off further bloodshed.

But the fighting in the Nuba Mountains, which sit in the north’s territory, underscores how fractured Sudan will remain even after the south secedes. The same demands being espoused by opposition fighters here have been the kindling for major conflict — and major suffering — in several other corners of northern Sudan, where the government is determined to keep a firm grip across a country of diverse groups clamoring for their rights.

In the few towns in this vast landscape of terraced mountainsides and thatched-roof villages, the northern government has been amassing tanks, rocket launchers, artillery and thousands of soldiers and allied militiamen, either to pressure Nuba leaders into disarming or to prepare for a major offensive once the rains stop in a few months.

While the hillsides are slick and muddy, the government can do little but bomb, as it admits doing. But government officials say their fight is solely with opposition fighters, not with civilians, contending that widespread reports of civilian casualties are fabrications intended to rally Western nations against Sudan.

“The government is trying to control and take care of the people for peace and security and actually defeat and remove all the traces of rebels from the area,” said Rabie A. Atti, a government spokesman. “We are not against the people,” Mr. Atti added.

But as the conflicts in the western region of Darfur and southern Sudan long before that have proved, counterinsurgencies often cast a wide net.

At a small, mountainside hospital here in Lewere, an entire ward is filled with victims who said they were at a well, fetching water, when they were bombed. Most are children. Their whimpers filter through the mesh windows, along with the pungent smells of antiseptic solution and decaying flesh.

Inside, Winnasa Steven, a 16-year-old girl, writhed on a cot. From her hip, doctors cut out a three-inch chunk of ragged shrapnel, which her mother keeps, wrapped in white paper.

“I am in big pain,” Winnasa said.

Next to her, a toddler cried, his face a map of bandages. Not far away, a little girl sucked down spoonfuls of porridge. Her mother tried not to look at the gaping hole in her leg.

Tensions had been building steadily in the Nuba Mountains since a disputed election in May. The governing party’s candidate, Ahmed Haroun, who has been indicted on charges of war crimes in Darfur by the International Criminal Court, won the governorship of Southern Kordofan, the state that encompasses the Nuba Mountains, by a margin of 6,500 votes out of a total of 400,000, defeating a popular Nuba leader who used to be a guerrilla fighter.

The Carter Center endorsed the election, but people say the government fiddled with the tallies because Southern Kordofan was too important to lose. It has the most productive oil fields in the north and borders the south, making it a useful rear base for the militias widely believed to be armed by the north. Kordofan also has fertile land, minerals and gum arabic, an ingredient in countless Western products.

This area has a history of oppression — and resistance. The Nuba people were enslaved by their neighbors hundreds of years ago, bombed by the British and subjugated by the north. The people here are not Arab like the northerners, and many are Christian. Tens of thousands of Nuba fighters joined southern rebels during the north-south civil war. It is these southern-allied fighters who are refusing to disarm, and clashes erupted in June.

In Kadugli, the biggest town in the Nuba Mountains region, many witnesses say the Sudanese Army and allied Arab militias have gone house to house, methodically executing civilians. Kamil Omer El Amin, a Nuba agricultural officer, matter-of-factly described what happened to his friend Philip.

“He drove up to the U.N. compound,” Mr. Amin said. “The intelligence agents told him to get out of the car. He sat down. They shot him in the chest.”

United Nations officials confirmed the killing, but said the overwhelming number of northern troops rendered them powerless to stop it, even though the shooting happened right outside the United Nations base

Many Nuba professionals have fled to the opposition-controlled mountaintops.

“We spent two weeks up there, drinking something you can barely call water,” said Caddy Ali, who worked for a project financed by the World Bank.

Ms. Ali said the agreement signed on Tuesday between southern-allied opposition leaders and the government, which outlined steps for political compromise and a cease-fire, was meaningless.

“We’re never going to forgive them now,” she said. “Do you know how many people I’ve seen die right in front of me?”

Aid workers said hundreds of civilians had been killed in the bombings. The Sudanese Army is also blockading roads and bombing airstrips, essentially cutting off food supplies. “These people are going to starve,” one Western aid worker said.

On Thursday, some Nuba aid workers stopped their car to pick up some deleib, a wild mushy fruit that looks like a coconut.

“This is what the fighters lived off in the 1990s,” Dr. Zakaria said. It seems some people are preparing to live off it again."
183,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan," Fatima Ramadan, mother of six, froze, her eyes shooting up to the sky.

“Antonov!” she yelled.

Little girls threw down the pebbles they were playing with. Toddlers, sensing danger, started to wail. About two dozen people grabbed the young and dashed up the mountainside into a cave. It was hot and dark inside, and the children’s eyes were wide with fear.

“I don’t like this place,” said Kaka, a 10-year-old girl.

Nobody does. And yet thousands of people live like this.

As the July 9 division of Sudan nears, the government in Khartoum is scrambling to crush any rebellious chunks of the territory that will remain its own. Its forces have been relentlessly pounding the Nuba Mountains from Russian-made Antonov bombers for weeks, demanding that tens of thousands of rebel fighters dug in here disarm and drop their insistence on more autonomy for the distinctive Nuba people. Hundreds of civilians have been killed, including many children. Bombs have been dropped on huts, on farmers in the field, on girls fetching water together, slicing them in half with buckets in their hands.

As the area inches toward becoming fully engulfed in war, the Nuba caves offer a crucial refuge.

Every morning at sunup, Ms. Ramadan trudges up a hillside, about 1,000 feet high, lugging pots, water jugs, mats and blankets, the children huffing behind.

She nestles her cooking fire in a crack in the mountain wall, to conceal the smoke. The young mothers around her dangle their legs over ledges as they nurse. Older children play a game similar to jacks, using pebbles on the precarious heights. Old men just sit and stare. At dusk, which usually signals the end of the sorties, most descend. Very few young men are with them.

“These caves have saved my children’s life,” Ms. Ramadan said. A couple of hundreds yards below her is the evidence: jagged chunks of shrapnel, gaping bomb craters and a tree trunk with a huge hole blown straight through it. The bombings have shifted west in recent days, away from the Lewere Valley toward what is emerging as the front line in an area called Korchi. But the fear endures like a scar.

“Even the sound of a car sends us running,” Ms. Ramadan said.

In another time, perhaps, a hike up this mountain would be a treat. The views from the top are amazing. The undulating Nuba heartland stretches for miles into the hazy distance, the tawny hilltops clear save for some scratchy green brush and a few trees stubbornly clinging to the rocks. Down below, thatched-roof huts squat together. A few people swing hoes. A few women plant on their knees, as if they are praying. A tan stripe — the only road — slices across the valley floor.

“This is all about land,” said Saida Bakhait, who is also hiding in a cave with her children.

“Bashir,” she says, referring to Sudan’s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, “needs our land and he wants to finish us off.”

The government says that its bombing campaign is solely directed at opposition fighters, not civilians. But if war comes, it will not be an easy fight.

“Be tough! Be strong! Protect our land!” shout legions of young men — “freedom fighters” they call themselves — as they march through the mist-shrouded valleys at dawn to add to the rebels’ numbers. They do not have guns, so they train with sticks. Many are freshly carved, the wood still white.

Land is often code for identity and the Nuba see this as a fight for their cultural survival. These mountains are an outpost of traditional beliefs and Christianity (though there are Muslim Nuba, too) in northern Sudan. Anthropologists have celebrated the Nuba for their singing, dancing, ferocious wrestling tournaments and dizzying number of languages, with nearly every major set of hills having its own tongue. Their land is among the most fertile in all of Sudan.

Because they had been subjugated by Sudan’s Arab rulers for generations, the Nuba sided with southern rebels during the latter half of Sudan’s north-south civil war, in the 1980s and ’90s. The government responded by bombing the hillsides, wiping out villages and incarcerating hundreds of thousands of Nuba in so-called peace camps where many were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint. People fled to caves then, too.

A peace treaty signed in 2004 called for Nuba to have a say in determining how much autonomy they would get — again, protecting their unique culture was a priority — but autonomy never came. Now, it seems, the government’s sudden interest in Nuba is timed to the south’s independence on Saturday. Khartoum may feel it has to send a signal that even after the south breaks off, the result of decades of struggle for liberation, it will not tolerate other secession movements.

“They lost southern Sudan with bitterness, and now they are projecting that bitterness on us,” said a Nuba man named Kuku.

In one place near Lewere, hundreds, perhaps thousands, are camped in caves. At least that is what some soldiers were saying. According to them, an entire village has uprooted itself to a mountaintop.

“But we can’t let you see it,” said a local elder at the foot of the mountain. He is sympathetic but firm.

“It’s the only place that hasn’t been bombed yet,” he said. “The last thing we want is for al-Bashir to know about it.”"
184,NYT,Jeffery Gettleman,2012,East Africa Conflict Somalia Sudan,"Think of it as the Battle of the Tweets.

Somalia’s powerful Islamist insurgents, the Shabab, best known for chopping off hands and starving their own people, just opened a Twitter account, and in the past week they have been writing up a storm, bragging about recent attacks and taunting their enemies.

“Your inexperienced boys flee from confrontation & flinch in the face of death,” the Shabab wrote in a post to the Kenyan Army.

It is an odd, almost downright hypocritical move from brutal militants in one of world’s most broken-down countries, where millions of people do not have enough food to eat, let alone a laptop. The Shabab have vehemently rejected Western practices — banning Western music, movies, haircuts and bras, and even blocking Western aid for famine victims, all in the name of their brand of puritanical Islam — only to embrace Twitter, one of the icons of a modern, networked society.

On top of that, the Shabab clearly have their hands full right now, facing thousands of African Union peacekeepers, the Kenyan military, the Ethiopian military and the occasional American drone strike all at the same time.

But terrorism experts say that Twitter terrorism is part of an emerging trend and that several other Qaeda franchises — a few years ago the Shabab pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda — are increasingly using social media like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter. The Qaeda branch in Yemen has proved especially adept at disseminating teachings and commentary through several different social media networks.

“Social media has helped terrorist groups recruit individuals, fund-raise and distribute propaganda more efficiently than they have in the past,” said Seth G. Jones, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation.

For the Shabab, this often translates into pithy postings, like “Europe was in darkness when Islam made advances in physics, Maths, astronomy, architecture, etc. before passing on the torch,” and sarcastic jabs at the Kenyan Army. Kenya’s military spokesman, Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir, is also a loquacious writer of posts, and the result is nothing short of a full-on Twitter war.

After Major Chirchir wrote that the Shabab might be transporting weapons on donkeys and that “any large concentration and movement of loaded donkeys will be considered as Al Shabaab activity,” the Shabab responded: “Like bombing donkeys, you mean! Your eccentric battle strategy has got animal rights groups quite concerned, Major.”

Major Chirchir fired back, “Life has better to offer than stonning innocent girl,” a reference to the Shabab’s penchant for harsh Islamic punishments like stoning.

The Shabab have teased Major Chirchir for his spelling mistakes and have tossed around some SAT-quality words.

“Stop prevaricating & say what you really think, Major!” the Shabab wrote. “Sure your comments will invite derision but try to muster (or feign) courage at least.”

Few Somalia hands are surprised by all this. The Shabab may be bloodthirsty, and in the areas they control — and they still control many — they have yanked out gold teeth, beheaded shopkeepers, sawed off arms and stoned adulterers. Yet, at the same time, they have shown their technical skills, making powerful suicide bombs and roadside explosives. They also have a geeky side, showcasing their work through slick propaganda videos, Web sites and digital chat rooms.

Beyond that — and quite frightening to many American officials — is the fact that educated Westerners are clearly working for the Shabab. Several Somali-Americans have killed themselves as suicide bombers, and even non-Somali Westerners, including one man from Alabama, are serving as battlefield commanders.

Of course, it is impossible to know who exactly is operating the Twitter account, HSMPress, which refers to the Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahedeen, or Movement of Holy Warrior Youth, the Shabab’s full name. But African Union and Western officials have said the account is legitimate, and HSMPress recently used Twitter to publish the identification cards of several missing African Union peacekeepers, presumably killed in battle. On Wednesday, the African Union confirmed that the cards were authentic.

The Twitter account is linked to an e-mail account operated by the Shabab “Press Office” that routinely provides detailed — though slanted — information about the continuing combat between the Shabab and the African Union peacekeepers. Sometimes, the Shabab’s information is more truthful than the African Union’s, as was the case during an intense recent battle in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, in which the Shabab claimed to have killed scores of peacekeepers, while the African Union initially said it had lost only 10. African Union officials later conceded that the Shabab had been correct.

The man behind the e-mails and possibly the Twitter posts calls himself Sheik Yoonis, which is probably a nom de guerre. He has responded to written questions from The New York Times and during a few rare telephone interviews spoke with a clipped British accent.

The Shabab news releases are written in colloquial, often clever, English, like this warning to peacekeepers from Burundi: “You now have a choice to make. Either you call for the immediate withdrawal of your troops from our country or you shall receive the bodies of your remaining sons delivered to you in bags. Think long. Think hard.”

Afyare Elmi, a Somali political scientist teaching at Qatar University, said the Shabab had a more coherent communication strategy than the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, a weak and fractured entity that controls very little territory and often contradicts itself in public statements. He added that the carefully composed e-mails and the Twitter account, which began Dec. 7, were part of a reinvigorated Shabab effort to burnish their public image.

Shabab fighters recently held a quiz show for children. (The prizes were grenades and an AK-47.) In October, Shabab leaders invited a masked Qaeda emissary to hand out dates and sacks of rice to famine victims. And just this week the Shabab announced the opening of a new “War Statistics Office,” clearly an attempt to convey a modicum of professionalism.

But few Somalis are fooled. The Shabab’s policies are imperiling what matters most — survival. Last month, with a famine still stalking parts of southern Somalia, the Shabab shut down 16 more aid groups, which many aid officials said was a surefire way to slowly kill thousands. Ever since the famine swept across southern Somalia this summer, the Shabab have been blocking food deliveries, diverting river water from starving farmers to their friends and even forcibly warehousing sick people in their own displaced persons camps.

Tens of thousands have already starved, and many Somalis are now cheering on the Kenyan and Ethiopian troops, traditionally mistrusted as meddling outsiders, who recently invaded Somalia to push the Shabab out of border areas.

On the streets of Mogadishu, a shot-up city that has been suspended in 20 years of civil war and anarchy, few people have ever heard of Twitter

“Is Twitter some sort of artillery that the Shabab is going to fire?” asked Muktar Abdi, a taxi driver. He said he had heard something like that on the radio.

It is clear that the Shabab, by posting comments in English, are trying to appeal to people outside Somalia. And it may be working.

As of Wednesday afternoon, the Shabab Twitter account had 3,186 followers. And true to their guerrilla spirit, the Shabab follow no one."
185,NYT,David Barboza,2013,Corruption Chica,"The mother of China’s prime minister was a schoolteacher in northern China. His father was ordered to tend pigs in one of Mao’s political campaigns. And during childhood, “my family was extremely poor,” the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said in a speech last year.

But now 90, the prime minister’s mother, Yang Zhiyun, not only left poverty behind, she became outright rich, at least on paper, according to corporate and regulatory records. Just one investment in her name, in a large Chinese financial services company, had a value of $120 million five years ago, the records show.

The details of how Ms. Yang, a widow, accumulated such wealth are not known, or even if she was aware of the holdings in her name. But it happened after her son was elevated to China’s ruling elite, first in 1998 as vice prime minister and then five years later as prime minister.

Many relatives of Wen Jiabao, including his son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law, have become extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership, an investigation by The New York Times shows. A review of corporate and regulatory records indicates that the prime minister’s relatives — some of whom, including his wife, have a knack for aggressive deal making — have controlled assets worth at least $2.7 billion.

In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners. Untangling their financial holdings provides an unusually detailed look at how politically connected people have profited from being at the intersection of government and business as state influence and private wealth converge in China’s fast-growing economy.

Unlike most new businesses in China, the family’s ventures sometimes received financial backing from state-owned companies, including China Mobile, one of the country’s biggest phone operators, the documents show. At other times, the ventures won support from some of Asia’s richest tycoons. The Times found that Mr. Wen’s relatives accumulated shares in banks, jewelers, tourist resorts, telecommunications companies and infrastructure projects, sometimes by using offshore entities.

The holdings include a villa development project in Beijing; a tire factory in northern China; a company that helped build some of Beijing’s Olympic stadiums, including the well-known “Bird’s Nest”; and Ping An Insurance, one of the world’s biggest financial services companies.

As prime minister in an economy that remains heavily state-driven, Mr. Wen, who is best known for his simple ways and common touch, more importantly has broad authority over the major industries where his relatives have made their fortunes. Chinese companies cannot list their shares on a stock exchange without approval from agencies overseen by Mr. Wen, for example. He also has the power to influence investments in strategic sectors like energy and telecommunications.

Because the Chinese government rarely makes its deliberations public, it is not known what role — if any — Mr. Wen, who is 70, has played in most policy or regulatory decisions. But in some cases, his relatives have sought to profit from opportunities made possible by those decisions.

The prime minister’s younger brother, for example, has a company that was awarded more than $30 million in government contracts and subsidies to handle wastewater treatment and medical waste disposal for some of China’s biggest cities, according to estimates based on government records. The contracts were announced after Mr. Wen ordered tougher regulations on medical waste disposal in 2003 after the SARS outbreak.

In 2004, after the State Council, a government body Mr. Wen presides over, exempted Ping An Insurance and other companies from rules that limited their scope, Ping An went on to raise $1.8 billion in an initial public offering of stock. Partnerships controlled by Mr. Wen’s relatives — along with their friends and colleagues — made a fortune by investing in the company before the public offering.

In 2007, the last year the stock holdings were disclosed in public documents, those partnerships held as much as $2.2 billion worth of Ping An stock, according to an accounting of the investments by The Times that was verified by outside auditors. Ping An’s overall market value is now nearly $60 billion.

Ping An said in a statement that the company did “not know the background of the entities behind our shareholders.” The statement said, “Ping An has no means to know the intentions behind shareholders when they buy and sell our shares.”

While Communist Party regulations call for top officials to disclose their wealth and that of their immediate family members, no law or regulation prohibits relatives of even the most senior officials from becoming deal-makers or major investors — a loophole that effectively allows them to trade on their family name. Some Chinese argue that permitting the families of Communist Party leaders to profit from the country’s long economic boom has been important to ensuring elite support for market-oriented reforms.

Even so, the business dealings of Mr. Wen’s relatives have sometimes been hidden in ways that suggest the relatives are eager to avoid public scrutiny, the records filed with Chinese regulatory authorities show. Their ownership stakes are often veiled by an intricate web of holdings as many as five steps removed from the operating companies, according to the review.

In the case of Mr. Wen’s mother, The Times calculated her stake in Ping An — valued at $120 million in 2007 — by examining public records and government-issued identity cards, and by following the ownership trail to three Chinese investment entities. The name recorded on his mother’s shares was Taihong, a holding company registered in Tianjin, the prime minister’s hometown

The apparent efforts to conceal the wealth reflect the highly charged politics surrounding the country’s ruling elite, many of whom are also enormously wealthy but reluctant to draw attention to their riches. When Bloomberg News reported in June that the extended family of Vice President Xi Jinping, set to become China’s next president, had amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the Chinese government blocked access inside the country to the Bloomberg Web site.

“In the senior leadership, there’s no family that doesn’t have these problems,” said a former government colleague of Wen Jiabao who has known him for more than 20 years and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.”

The Times presented its findings to the Chinese government for comment. The Foreign Ministry declined to respond to questions about the investments, the prime minister or his relatives. Members of Mr. Wen’s family also declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

Duan Weihong, a wealthy businesswoman whose company, Taihong, was the investment vehicle for the Ping An shares held by the prime minister’s mother and other relatives, said the investments were actually her own. Ms. Duan, who comes from the prime minister’s hometown and is a close friend of his wife, said ownership of the shares was listed in the names of Mr. Wen’s relatives in an effort to conceal the size of Ms. Duan’s own holdings.

“When I invested in Ping An I didn’t want to be written about,” Ms. Duan said, “so I had my relatives find some other people to hold these shares for me.”

But it was an “accident,” she said, that her company chose the relatives of the prime minister as the listed shareholders — a process that required registering their official ID numbers and obtaining their signatures. Until presented with the names of the investors by The Times, she said, she had no idea that they had selected the relatives of Wen Jiabao.

The review of the corporate and regulatory records, which covers 1992 to 2012, found no holdings in Mr. Wen’s name. And it was not possible to determine from the documents whether he recused himself from any decisions that might have affected his relatives’ holdings, or whether they received preferential treatment on investments.

For much of his tenure, Wen Jiabao has been at the center of rumors and conjecture about efforts by his relatives to profit from his position. Yet until the review by The Times, there has been no detailed accounting of the family’s riches.

His wife, Zhang Beili, is one of the country’s leading authorities on jewelry and gemstones and is an accomplished businesswoman in her own right. By managing state diamond companies that were later privatized, The Times found, she helped her relatives parlay their minority stakes into a billion-dollar portfolio of insurance, technology and real estate ventures.

The couple’s only son sold a technology company he started to the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, for $10 million, and used another investment vehicle to establish New Horizon Capital, now one of China’s biggest private equity firms, with partners like the government of Singapore, according to records and interviews with bankers.

The prime minister’s younger brother, Wen Jiahong, controls $200 million in assets, including wastewater treatment plants and recycling businesses, the records show.

As prime minister, Mr. Wen has staked out a position as a populist and a reformer, someone whom the state-run media has nicknamed “the People’s Premier” and “Grandpa Wen” because of his frequent outings to meet ordinary people, especially in moments of crisis like natural disasters.

While it is unclear how much the prime minister knows about his family’s wealth, State Department documents released by the WikiLeaks organization in 2010 included a cable that suggested Mr. Wen was aware of his relatives’ business dealings and unhappy about them.

“Wen is disgusted with his family’s activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them,” a Chinese-born executive working at an American company in Shanghai told American diplomats, according to the 2007 cable.

China’s ‘Diamond Queen’
It is no secret in China’s elite circles that the prime minister’s wife, Zhang Beili, is rich, and that she has helped control the nation’s jewelry and gem trade. But her lucrative diamond businesses became an off-the-charts success only as her husband moved into the country’s top leadership ranks, the review of corporate and regulatory records by The Times found.

A geologist with an expertise in gemstones, Ms. Zhang is largely unknown among ordinary Chinese. She rarely travels with the prime minister or appears with him, and there are few official photographs of the couple together. And while people who have worked with her say she has a taste for jade and fine diamonds, they say she usually dresses modestly, does not exude glamour and prefers to wield influence behind the scenes, much like the relatives of other senior leaders.

The State Department documents released by WikiLeaks included a suggestion that Mr. Wen had once considered divorcing Ms. Zhang because she had exploited their relationship in her diamond trades. Taiwanese television reported in 2007 that Ms. Zhang had bought a pair of jade earrings worth about $275,000 at a Beijing trade show, though the source — a Taiwanese trader — later backed off the claim and Chinese government censors moved swiftly to block coverage of the subject in China, according to news reports at the time.

“Her business activities are known to everyone in the leadership,” said one banker who worked with relatives of Wen Jiabao. The banker said it was not unusual for her office to call upon businesspeople. “And if you get that call, how can you say no?”

Zhang Beili first gained influence in the 1990s, while working as a regulator at the Ministry of Geology. At the time, China’s jewelry market was still in its infancy.

While her husband was serving in China’s main leadership compound, known as Zhongnanhai, Ms. Zhang was setting industry standards in the jewelry and gem trade. She helped create the National Gemstone Testing Center in Beijing, and the Shanghai Diamond Exchange, two of the industry’s most powerful institutions.

In a country where the state has long dominated the marketplace, jewelry regulators often decided which companies could set up diamond-processing factories, and which would gain entry to the retail jewelry market. State regulators even formulated rules that required diamond sellers to buy certificates of authenticity for any diamond sold in China, from the government-run testing center in Beijing, which Ms. Zhang managed.

As a result, when executives from Cartier or De Beers visited China with hopes of selling diamonds and jewelry here, they often went to visit Ms. Zhang, who became known as China’s “diamond queen.”

“She’s the most important person there,” said Gaetano Cavalieri, president of the World Jewelry Confederation in Switzerland. “She was bridging relations between partners — Chinese and foreign partners.”

As early as 1992, people who worked with Ms. Zhang said, she had begun to blur the line between government official and businesswoman. As head of the state-owned China Mineral and Gem Corporation, she began investing the state company’s money in start-ups. And by the time her husband was named vice premier, in 1998, she was busy setting up business ventures with friends and relatives.

The state company she ran invested in a group of affiliated diamond companies, according to public records. Many of them were run by Ms. Zhang’s relatives — or colleagues who had worked with her at the National Gemstone Testing Center.

In 1993, for instance, the state company Ms. Zhang ran helped found Beijing Diamond, a big jewelry retailer. A year later, one of her younger brothers, Zhang Jianming, and two of her government colleagues personally acquired 80 percent of the company, according to shareholder registers. Beijing Diamond invested in Shenzhen Diamond, which was controlled by her brother-in-law, Wen Jiahong, the prime minister’s younger brother.

Among the successful undertakings was Sino-Diamond, a venture financed by the state-owned China Mineral and Gem Corporation, which she headed. The company had business ties with a state-owned company managed by another brother, Zhang Jiankun, who worked as an official in Jiaxing, Ms. Zhang’s hometown, in Zhejiang Province.

In the summer of 1999, after securing agreements to import diamonds from Russia and South Africa, Sino-Diamond went public, raising $50 million on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The offering netted Ms. Zhang’s family about $8 million, according to corporate filings.

Although she was never listed as a shareholder, former colleagues and business partners say Ms. Zhang’s early diamond partnerships were the nucleus of a larger portfolio of companies she would later help her family and colleagues gain a stake in.

The Times found no indication that Wen Jiabao used his political clout to influence the diamond companies his relatives invested in. But former business partners said that the family’s success in diamonds, and beyond, was often bolstered with financial backing from wealthy businessmen who sought to curry favor with the prime minister’s family.

“After Wen became prime minister, his wife sold off some of her diamond investments and moved into new things,” said a Chinese executive who did business with the family. He asked not to be named because of fear of government retaliation. Corporate records show that beginning in the late 1990s, a series of rich businessmen took turns buying up large stakes in the diamond companies, often from relatives of Mr. Wen, and then helped them reinvest in other lucrative ventures, like real estate and finance.

According to corporate records and interviews, the businessmen often supplied accountants and office space to investment partnerships partly controlled by the relatives.

“When they formed companies,” said one businessman who set up a company with members of the Wen family, “Ms. Zhang stayed in the background. That’s how it worked.”

The Only Son
Late one evening early this year, the prime minister’s only son, Wen Yunsong, was in the cigar lounge at Xiu, an upscale bar and lounge at the Park Hyatt in Beijing. He was having cocktails as Beijing’s nouveau riche gathered around, clutching designer bags and wearing expensive business suits, according to two guests who were present.

In China, the children of senior leaders are widely believed to be in a class of their own. Known as “princelings,” they often hold Ivy League degrees, get V.I.P. treatment, and are even offered preferred pricing on shares in hot stock offerings.

 

They are also known as people who can get things done in China’s heavily regulated marketplace, where the state controls access. And in recent years, few princelings have been as bold as the younger Mr. Wen, who goes by the English name Winston and is about 40 years old.

A Times review of Winston Wen’s investments, and interviews with people who have known him for years, show that his deal-making has been extensive and lucrative, even by the standards of his princeling peers.

State-run giants like China Mobile have formed start-ups with him. In recent years, Winston Wen has been in talks with Hollywood studios about a financing deal.

Concerned that China does not have an elite boarding school for Chinese students, he recently hired the headmasters of Choate and Hotchkiss in Connecticut to oversee the creation of a $150 million private school now being built in the Beijing suburbs.

Winston Wen and his wife, moreover, have stakes in the technology industry and an electric company, as well as an indirect stake in Union Mobile Pay, the government-backed online payment platform — all while living in the prime minister’s residence, in central Beijing, according to corporate records and people familiar with the family’s investments.

“He’s not shy about using his influence to get things done,” said one venture capitalist who regularly meets with Winston Wen.

The younger Mr. Wen declined to comment. But in a telephone interview, his wife, Yang Xiaomeng, said her husband had been unfairly criticized for his business dealings.

“Everything that has been written about him has been wrong,” she said. “He’s really not doing that much business anymore.”

Winston Wen was educated in Beijing and then earned an engineering degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology. He went abroad and earned a master’s degree in engineering materials from the University of Windsor, in Canada, and an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., just outside Chicago.

When he returned to China in 2000, he helped set up three successful technology companies in five years, according to people familiar with those deals. Two of them were sold to Hong Kong businessmen, one to the family of Li Ka-shing, one of the wealthiest men in Asia.

Winston Wen’s earliest venture, an Internet data services provider called Unihub Global, was founded in 2000 with $2 million in start-up capital, according to Hong Kong and Beijing corporate filings. Financing came from a tight-knit group of relatives and his mother’s former colleagues from government and the diamond trade, as well as an associate of Cheng Yu-tung, patriarch of Hong Kong’s second-wealthiest family. The firm’s earliest customers were state-owned brokerage houses and Ping An, in which the Wen family has held a large financial stake.

He made an even bolder move in 2005, by pushing into private equity when he formed New Horizon Capital with a group of Chinese-born classmates from Northwestern. The firm quickly raised $100 million from investors, including SBI Holdings, a division of the Japanese group SoftBank, and Temasek, the Singapore government investment fund.

Under Mr. Wen, New Horizon established itself as a leading private equity firm, investing in biotech, solar, wind and construction equipment makers. Since it began operations, the firm has returned about $430 million to investors, a fourfold profit, according to SBI Holdings.

“Their first fund was dynamite,” said Kathleen Ng, editor of Asia Private Equity Review, an industry publication in Hong Kong. “And that allowed them to raise a lot more money.”

Some of Winston Wen’s deal-making, though, has attracted unwanted attention for the prime minister.

In 2010, when New Horizon acquired a 9 percent stake in a company called Sihuan Pharmaceuticals just two months before its public offering, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange said the late-stage investment violated its rules and forced the firm to return the stake. Still, New Horizon made a $46.5 million profit on the sale.

Soon after, New Horizon announced that Winston Wen had handed over day-to-day operations and taken up a position at the China Satellite Communications Corporation, a state-owned company that has ties to the Chinese space program. He has since been named chairman.

The Tycoons
In the late 1990s, Duan Weihong was managing an office building and several other properties in Tianjin, the prime minister’s hometown in northern China, through her property company, Taihong. She was in her 20s and had studied at the Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

Around 2002, Ms. Duan went into business with several relatives of Wen Jiabao, transforming her property company into an investment vehicle of the same name. The company helped make Ms. Duan very wealthy.

It is not known whether Ms. Duan, now 43, is related to the prime minister. In a series of interviews, she first said she did not know any members of the Wen family, but later described herself as a friend of the family and particularly close to Zhang Beili, the prime minister’s wife. As happened to a handful of other Chinese entrepreneurs, Ms. Duan’s fortunes soared as she teamed up with the relatives and their network of friends and colleagues, though she described her relationship with them involving the shares in Ping An as existing on paper only and having no financial component.

Ms. Duan and other wealthy businesspeople — among them, six billionaires from across China — have been instrumental in getting multimillion-dollar ventures off the ground and, at crucial times, helping members of the Wen family set up investment vehicles to profit from them, according to investment bankers who have worked with all parties.

 

Established in Tianjin, Taihong had spectacular returns. In 2002, the company paid about $65 million to acquire a 3 percent stake in Ping An before its initial public offering, according to corporate records and Ms. Duan’s graduate school thesis. Five years later, those shares were worth $3.7 billion

The company’s Hong Kong affiliate, Great Ocean, also run by Ms. Duan, later formed a joint venture with the Beijing government and acquired a huge tract of land adjacent to Capital International Airport. Today, the site is home to a sprawling cargo and logistics center. Last year, Great Ocean sold its 53 percent stake in the project to a Singapore company for nearly $400 million.

That deal and several other investments, in luxury hotels, Beijing villa developments and the Hong Kong-listed BBMG, one of China’s largest building materials companies, have been instrumental to Ms. Duan’s accumulation of riches, according to The Times’s review of corporate records.

The review also showed that over the past decade there have been nearly three dozen individual shareholders of Taihong, many of whom are either relatives of Wen Jiabao or former colleagues of his wife.

The other wealthy entrepreneurs who have worked with the prime minister’s relatives declined to comment for this article. Ms. Duan strongly denied having financial ties to the prime minister or his relatives and said she was only trying to avoid publicity by listing others as owning Ping An shares. “The money I invested in Ping An was completely my own,” said Ms. Duan, who has served as a member of the Ping An board of supervisors. “Everything I did was legal.”

Another wealthy partner of the Wen relatives has been Cheng Yu-tung, who controls the Hong Kong conglomerate New World Development and is one of the richest men in Asia, worth about $15 billion, according to Forbes.

In the 1990s, New World was seeking a foothold in mainland China for a sister company that specializes in high-end retail jewelry. The retail chain, Chow Tai Fook, opened its first store in China in 1998.

Mr. Cheng and his associates invested in a diamond venture backed by the relatives of Mr. Wen and co-invested with them in an array of corporate entities, including Sino-Life, National Trust and Ping An, according to records and interviews with some of those involved. Those investments by Mr. Cheng are now worth at least $5 billion, according to the corporate filings. Chow Tai Fook, the jewelry chain, has also flourished. Today, China accounts for 60 percent of the chain’s $4.2 billion in annual revenue.

Mr. Cheng, 87, could not be reached for comment. Calls to New World Development were not returned.

In the winter of 2007, just before he began his second term as prime minister, Wen Jiabao called for new measures to fight corruption, particularly among high-ranking officials.

“Leaders at all levels of government should take the lead in the antigraft drive,” he told a gathering of high-level party members in Beijing. “They should strictly ensure that their family members, friends and close subordinates do not abuse government influence.”

The speech was consistent with the prime minister’s earlier drive to toughen disclosure rules for public servants, and to require senior officials to reveal their family assets.

Whether Mr. Wen has made such disclosures for his own family is unclear, since the Communist Party does not release such information. Even so, many of the holdings found by The Times would not need to be disclosed under the rules since they are not held in the name of the prime minister’s immediate family — his wife, son and daughter.

Eighty percent of the $2.7 billion in assets identified in The Times’s investigation and verified by the outside auditors were held by, among others, the prime minister’s mother, his younger brother, two brothers-in-law, a sister-in-law, daughter-in-law and the parents of his son’s wife, none of whom is subject to party disclosure rules. The total value of the relatives’ stake in Ping An is based on calculations by The Times that were confirmed by the auditors. The total includes shares held by the relatives that were sold between 2004 and 2006, and the value of the remaining shares in late 2007, the last time the holdings were publicly disclosed.

Legal experts said that determining the precise value of holdings in China could be difficult because there might be undisclosed side agreements about the true beneficiaries.

“Complex corporate structures are not necessarily insidious,” said Curtis J. Milhaupt, a Columbia University Law School professor who has studied China’s corporate group structures. “But in a system like China’s, where corporate ownership and political power are closely intertwined, shell companies magnify questions about who owns what and where the money came from.”

Among the investors in the Wen family ventures are longtime business associates, former colleagues and college classmates, including Yu Jianming, who attended Northwestern with Winston Wen, and Zhang Yuhong, a longtime colleague of Wen Jiahong, the prime minister’s younger brother. The associates did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

Revelations about the Wen family’s wealth could weaken him politically.

Next month, at the 18th Party Congress in Beijing, the Communist Party is expected to announce a new generation of leaders. But the selection process has already been marred by one of the worst political scandals in decades, the downfall of Bo Xilai, the Chongqing party boss, who was vying for a top position.

In Beijing, Wen Jiabao is expected to step down as prime minister in March at the end of his second term. Political analysts say that even after leaving office he could remain a strong backstage political force. But documents showing that his relatives amassed a fortune during his tenure could diminish his standing, the analysts said.

“This will affect whatever residual power Wen has,” said Minxin Pei, an expert on Chinese leadership and a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California.

The prime minister’s supporters say he has not personally benefited from his extended family’s business dealings, and may not even be knowledgeable about the extent of them.

Last March, the prime minister hinted that he was at least aware of the persistent rumors about his relatives. During a nationally televised news conference in Beijing, he insisted that he had “never pursued personal gain” in public office.

“I have the courage to face the people and to face history,” he said in an emotional session. “There are people who will appreciate what I have done, but there are also people who will criticize me. Ultimately, history will have the final say.”"
186,NYT,David Barboza,2013,Corruption Chica,"The head of a financially troubled insurer was pushing Chinese officials to relax rules that required breaking up the company in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.

The survival of Ping An Insurance was at stake, officials were told in the fall of 1999. Direct appeals were made to the vice premier at the time, Wen Jiabao, as well as the then-head of China’s central bank — two powerful officials with oversight of the industry.

“I humbly request that the vice premier lead and coordinate the matter from a higher level,” Ma Mingzhe, chairman of Ping An, implored in a letter to Mr. Wen that was reviewed by The New York Times.

Ping An was not broken up.

The successful outcome of the lobbying effort would prove monumental.

Ping An went on to become one of China’s largest financial services companies, a $50 billion powerhouse now worth more than A.I.G., MetLife or Prudential. And behind the scenes, shares in Ping An that would be worth billions of dollars once the company rebounded were acquired by relatives of Mr. Wen.

The Times reported last month that the relatives of Mr. Wen, who became prime minister in 2003, had grown extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership, acquiring stakes in tourist resorts, banks, jewelers, telecommunications companies and other business ventures.

The greatest source of wealth, by far, The Times investigation has found, came from the shares in Ping An bought about eight months after the insurer was granted a waiver to the requirement that big financial companies be broken up.

Long before most investors could buy Ping An stock, Taihong, a company that would soon be controlled by Mr. Wen’s relatives, acquired a large stake in Ping An from state-owned entities that held shares in the insurer, regulatory and corporate records show. And by all appearances, Taihong got a sweet deal. The shares were bought in December 2002 for one-quarter of the price that another big investor — the British bank HSBC Holdings — paid for its shares just two months earlier, according to interviews and public filings.

By June 2004, the shares held by the Wen relatives had already quadrupled in value, even before the company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. And by 2007, the initial $65 million investment made by Taihong would be worth $3.7 billion.

Corporate records show that the relatives’ stake of that investment most likely peaked at $2.2 billion in late 2007, the last year in which Taihong’s shareholder records were publicly available. Because the company is no longer listed in Ping An’s public filings, it is unclear if the relatives continue to hold shares.

It is also not known whether Mr. Wen or the central bank chief at the time, Dai Xianglong, personally intervened on behalf of Ping An’s request for a waiver, or if Mr. Wen was even aware of the stakes held by his relatives.

But internal Ping An documents, government filings and interviews with bankers and former senior executives at Ping An indicate that both the vice premier’s office and the central bank were among the regulators involved in the Ping An waiver meetings and who had the authority to sign off on the waiver.

Only two large state-run financial institutions were granted similar waivers, filings show, while three of China’s big state-run insurance companies were forced to break up. Many of the country’s big banks complied with the breakup requirement — enforced after the financial crisis because of concerns about the stability of the financial system — by selling their assets in other institutions.

Ping An issued a statement to The Times saying the company strictly complies with rules and regulations, but does not know the backgrounds of all entities behind shareholders. The company also said “it is the legitimate right of shareholders to buy and sell shares between themselves.”

In Beijing, China’s foreign ministry did not return calls seeking comment for this article. Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman sharply criticized the investigation by The Times into the finances of Mr. Wen’s relatives, saying it “smears China and has ulterior motives.”

After The Times reported last month on the family’s wealth, lawyers representing the family said the article contained unspecified errors and that the family reserved the right to take legal action.

In addition, the Chinese government blocked access to the English-language and Chinese-language Web sites of The Times in China — and continues to do so — saying the action was “in accordance with laws and rules.”

Neither Mr. Wen, who is expected to retire in March, nor Mr. Dai, who is now the head of the National Social Security Fund, could be reached for comment.

Western and Chinese bankers and lawyers involved in Ping An’s 2004 Hong Kong stock listing and a subsequent 2007 listing in Shanghai said they did not know that relatives of Mr. Wen had acquired large stakes in the company.

Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which once held sizable stakes in Ping An and served as lead underwriters for the Hong Kong public offering, also said they were never told of the holdings. At Ping An’s urging, the two investment banks had also appealed in 2000 to Mr. Wen and other regulators for the waiver from the breakup rule. The private equity divisions of the two investment banks sold their combined stakes to HSBC in 2005 for about $1 billion — a 14-fold increase on their initial investment.

Thousands of pages of publicly available corporate documents reviewed by The Times suggest that the Ping An stakes held by the prime minister’s relatives were concealed behind layers of obscure partnerships rather than being held directly in their names.

In an interview last month, Duan Weihong, a wealthy Wen family friend, said that the shares in Ping An actually belonged to her and that it was an accident that Mr. Wen’s relatives appeared in shareholding records. The process involved borrowing their government identity cards and obtaining their signatures.

China and Hong Kong have detailed regulations on the disclosure of corporate information deemed material to a publicly listed company’s operation, like the identities of large shareholders and details about whether companies controlling large stakes are related parties. But legal experts say enforcement is often lax, particularly inside China. There is also, they say, a culture of nominee shareholders — when one person holds shares on behalf of someone else — that is difficult for even the most seasoned lawyers and accountants to penetrate.

The Times found no indication such regulations or any law was broken, nor any evidence that Mr. Wen held shares in Ping An under his own name.

After reviewing questions from The Times, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange declined to comment. The China Securities Regulatory Commission in Beijing did not respond to inquiries.

HSBC, today Ping An’s largest shareholder with about 15.5 percent of its stock, declined to comment. The company announced last week that it is considering selling its stake in Ping An as part of a broad effort to raise capital.

Ping An today is a hugely successful conglomerate with revenue of $40 billion last year and about 500,000 insurance agents across China. It is China’s only fully integrated financial institution, with the second largest insurer, a trust company and brokerage house.

In late 2010, Ping An added more firepower, announcing a $4 billion deal that has since given it control of the Shenzhen Development Bank, one of China’s midsize commercial banks. Ping An is now building a new headquarters here in Shenzhen, a spectacular 115-story office tower that was designed by the New York architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox.

Ping An’s Close Call
Ma Mingzhe, the Ping An chairman and chief executive, was a high school graduate who got his start as an aide to Yuan Geng, a pioneering figure in some of China’s earliest economic reforms and an early leader of Ping An.

Impressed with Mr. Ma’s intellect, Mr. Yuan put him in charge of human resources at a state-managed industrial park, and eventually at a new insurance firm, Ping An, which took root in Shenzhen, a coastal boomtown.

Mr. Ma’s timing was opportune. China was just beginning to restructure its state-led economy. The government began dismantling the iron rice bowl system, which had guaranteed pensions, social insurance and living quarters to Communist Party cadres.

Although Ping An was founded as a state entity, it was one of the first Chinese insurance companies to experiment with Western management systems, including the use of actuaries and back-office operations, as well as foreign shareholders.

Mr. Ma helped manage the tiny company when it was founded in 1988. Several years later, he was looking for big-name shareholders from the United States.

In 1994, the private equity divisions of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs each paid about $35 million to acquire 7.5 percent interests in Ping An. At the time, they were the largest foreign investments ever made in a Chinese financial institution.

Much of the company’s early success was attributed to Mr. Ma, a hard-charging executive who was admired for his management and political skills — and for taking risks.

“He had all the qualities of a great entrepreneur,” says Yan Feng, who helped run Ping An’s Shanghai office in the 1990s. “He was a quick learner, knew how to adapt to new situations and was really determined. He’d do whatever it takes to get what he wants.”

But the company’s growth drive ran into trouble in the late 1990s, when China’s economy weakened after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

The bloated state sector began to collapse, and by 1998, some of the nation’s biggest banks were nearly insolvent.

Ping An’s hard-won fortunes were also evaporating. Like most big Chinese insurers, Ping An had won new clients with investment products that guaranteed big returns over long periods based on the high interest rates banks offered for deposits during a time of inflation. When interest rates plummeted in the mid-1990s, losses piled up.

In 1999, senior executives at Ping An began to acknowledge that the company could soon be insolvent. As a joint-stockholding company, Ping An had big institutional investors, mostly state companies. But many of them refused to come to the company’s aid by purchasing additional shares, which would have provided needed capital.

“They weren’t sure Ping An would survive,” said one former Ping An executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

There was also mounting pressure from the government. Worried about systemic risks to the financial system, regulators in Beijing stepped up their enforcement of laws that required financial institutions to limit the scope of their business activities.

Banks were told to sell their stakes in brokerage houses or trust companies; and insurance companies had to choose to operate in life or property insurance, but not both.

After China’s new insurance regulatory agency was established in 1998, it began pressing Ping An to shed its trust and securities business, and to split its life and property insurance divisions into separate companies.

At a news conference in November 1999, Ma Yongwei, then the chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, said the agency had already drawn up plans to split up Ping An and other insurers.

“The separation plans have been submitted to the State Council for approval,” Ma Yongwei told the media, adding that they would “deepen reform of the insurance system.”

Pushing Back the Regulators
With his company about to be broken up, Ma Mingzhe, also known as Peter Ma, fired off letters to leaders in Beijing, dictated memos reminding himself to “buy golf clubs” for high-ranking officials, and kept detailed charts outlining the lobbying responsibilities of each top executive at Ping An, according to a copy of those records verified by former Ping An executives.

Mr. Ma focused much of his personal energy on China’s highest government administrative body, the State Council, a 38-member group whose senior leaders were Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao, then vice premier. The company also sought the support of Dai Xianglong, the nation’s central bank chief, who also had oversight over the insurance industry.

Mr. Wen was in a unique position. He was head of China’s powerful Central Financial Work Commission, which had been established in 1998 to oversee the country’s banking, securities and insurance regulators, as well as China’s biggest financial institutions.

When Mr. Ma met regulators, he told them his company was facing insolvency and asked them to help shore up the company’s balance sheet by approving a Hong Kong stock offering, according to transcripts of Ping An meetings and interviews with participants.

“Now, Ping An’s life insurance is in a loss, and property insurance and the trust company have thin margins,” Mr. Ma wrote in the Sept. 29, 1999, letter to Mr. Wen. The contents were confirmed by two former top Ping An executives.

Rather than an out-and-out breakup, Mr. Ma offered a middle road. After seeking advice of other investors, Mr. Ma proposed the formation of a holding company that would effectively separate life insurance from property but keep them under one corporate umbrella, along with the securities and trust division.

The company, he said, would re-establish itself as the Ping An Group, according to Ping An documents reviewed by The Times. He then began looking for allies to promote his proposal.

In January 2000, with Mr. Ma’s backing, executives from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs wrote a joint letter to Mr. Wen arguing that a breakup would “violate China’s policy to encourage and protect foreign investment,” according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The Times. The letter’s authenticity was verified by former executives at the two investment banks.

The American investment banks warned that “as a listed company in the U.S., we could be required to disclose our losses relating to the investment in Ping An, which would not be helpful for the image of China’s policy of reform and opening to the outside.”

The letter came after months of aggressive lobbying on the part of Ping An executives and the two American banks to persuade other high-ranking officials in Beijing, including the central bank and the insurance regulator, to hold Ping An together, according to corporate documents reviewed by The Times.

As early as 1999, executives at Ping An also began making contact with the relatives of Mr. Wen.

Hu Kun, a former Ping An employee who served as Mr. Ma’s staff assistant from 1997 to 2000, recalled a 1999 meeting between Mr. Ma and Zhang Beili, the wife of Mr. Wen.

Mr. Hu said he was not told what transpired at the meeting, but he recalled his boss’s reaction. “Because of that meeting, Chairman Ma got very excited,” said Mr. Hu, who is now living in the United States and who has quarreled with Ping An over 52,000 shares he claimed he was owed.

Corporate records reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Ma held an afternoon meeting and then dinner with the prime minister’s wife and Li Chunyan, who ran Ping An’s office in Beijing, on June 17, 1999.

It is not known what they discussed, but the relationship seemed to flourish. Around the same time, a diamond company partly controlled by the relatives of Ms. Zhang began occupying office space at the Ping An office tower in Beijing, according to records the diamond company filed with regulators. Later, a start-up co-founded by Wen Yunsong, the son of Ms. Zhang and the prime minister, won a lucrative technology contract from Ping An, according to interviews with former Ping An executives.

Mr. Ma, who is 56 and still runs Ping An, declined to comment for this article. Interviews with four senior executives who worked with Mr. Ma and Mr. Hu at the corporate headquarters in Shenzhen during the same period corroborate Mr. Hu’s recollections and the content of the documents reviewed by The Times concerning Ping An’s lobbying efforts and meetings with the relatives of Mr. Wen.

In addition, Li Chunyan, who ran the Beijing office, confirmed in a telephone interview that during that period he had brought Ms. Zhang to meet the Ping An chairman, Mr. Ma.

The documents and interviews shed no light on whether those meetings played a role in the decision by government regulators to abandon plans to split up Ping An. But in April 2002, the nation’s top regulators delivered their verdict. With approval of the State Council and insurance regulators, Ping An began the process of transforming itself into a financial conglomerate.

The company was not only allowed to retain property and life insurance licenses, but also licenses that permitted it to operate a brokerage and a trust company. It was also allowed to obtain a bank license.

Together, analysts say, the licenses were worth a fortune in China’s tightly regulated marketplace.

“They were one of the few who got to enjoy these gold-digging benefits,” said Bob Leung, a longtime insurance analyst at UBS in Hong Kong.

By late 2002, Ping An had not simply survived the downturn, its prospects had begun to look bright. The company’s restructuring bolstered revenue and profits. In October of that year, one of the world’s biggest banks, HSBC, agreed to pay $600 million to acquire a 10 percent stake in the company from Ping An. Just over a year later, regulators approved the company’s application to list and sell shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

While Ping An was preparing for its listing in Hong Kong, a group of investors with close ties to senior officials in Beijing, including Wen Jiabao, were quietly accumulating large blocks of Ping An stock.

Buying Into Ping An
On Dec. 26, 2002, Ping An filings show, a company run by Duan Weihong, a Wen family friend from the prime minister’s hometown, acquired Ping An stock through a company called Taihong. Soon after, the relatives of Mr. Wen and colleagues of his wife took control of that investment vehicle, the records show.

According to documents Ping An filed ahead of its Hong Kong listing, Taihong acquired 77.7 million shares of Ping An from the China Ocean Shipping Company, a global shipping giant known as Cosco, and 2.2 million more shares from Cosco’s Dalian subsidiary. A two-for-one stock split doubled the number of shares Taihong owned. So in June 2004, just before Ping An’s Hong Kong offering, Taihong held 159.8 million shares, or about 3.2 percent of Ping An’s stock, according to public filings.

In an interview, Ms. Duan said she had paid about 40 cents a share at current exchange rates, or a total of $65 million, to acquire the shares.

The price seems to have been a huge and unusual discount, analysts say, since HSBC had two months earlier acquired its 10 percent stake for about $1.60 a share, according to public filings.

Cosco did not return calls seeking comment.

For Taihong, it was a blockbuster purchase. By 2007, when the price of Ping An’s stock peaked, the 159 million shares were valued at $3.7 billion — though by 2007 Taihong had already significantly reduced its stake, according to public filings.

While Taihong was the shareholder of record, the beneficiaries of the Ping An deal were cloaked behind more than a dozen investment vehicles controlled by the relatives of Mr. Wen, including two brothers-in-law, a sister-in-law, as well as several longtime colleagues and business partners of his wife, Zhang Beili, according to corporate and regulatory documents. All of them were listed, along with Ms. Duan, as the owners of Taihong.

And by 2007, the prime minister’s mother, who is now 91, was listed on public documents as holding $120 million worth of Ping An stock through a pair of investment companies linked to Taihong.

Ms. Duan, who says she got to know the prime minister’s family in 2000, said that she bought the Ping An shares for her own personal account. The Wen relatives only appear in the Taihong shareholding records, she said, because her company borrowed the government-issued identity cards of other people — mistakenly, she said, from relatives of the prime minister — to help mask her own Ping An stake from the public.

“In the end,” Ms. Duan said, “I received 100 percent of the returns.”

The Fallout
In 2001, China issued new regulations that put restrictions on trading in listed shares by Communist Party members and their families.

For instance, the rules barred party officials in charge of a state-owned company from using their parents, children — or even their children’s spouse’s relatives — to trade stocks of a listed state-owned company.

The Times found no indication that Mr. Wen shared inside information with family members.

But there are many unanswered questions about the relatives’ holdings, analysts consulted by The Times said, like who might have known about the relatives’ purchases and whether anyone had a legal obligation to disclose that information.

Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs say they were unaware of the share purchases and were not involved in the transactions.

The companies also said that a typical I.P.O. process is unlikely to uncover the ultimate identity of shareholders who are hiding behind layers of investment vehicles using unrecognizable names.

According to regulations in Hong Kong and China, publicly listed companies and their professional partners who help sell shares to the public are legally obligated to disclose the identities of only those shareholders controlling a stake larger than 5 percent. The Times found that at its peak, Taihong, the investment vehicle tied to the Wen family, never held more than a 3.2 percent stake.

Another question that remains unanswered is how Taihong was able to buy shares of Ping An at a price that appears to have been highly discounted. By late 2002, Ping An had already become a hot I.P.O. prospect following a big investment by HSBC.

The answers to some of the questions, legal experts say, may turn on who was involved in brokering the deal that led to the relatives’ acquiring shares in Ping An in the period before the company’s public offering in 2004, and whether the deal-makers were seeking to gain favors from the regulators.

“The key questions are: why were these people chosen, and on what terms did they get the shares?” said Jerome A. Cohen, a professor at New York University Law School and an expert on China’s legal system. “Obviously, everyone would like to get in before a hot I.P.O.”"
187,NYT,David Barboza,2013,Corruption Chica,"The Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation recently announced a bold move to crack China’s tightly protected film industry: a $330 million deal to create a Shanghai animation studio that might one day rival the California shops that turn out hits like “Kung Fu Panda” and “The Incredibles.”
 
What DreamWorks did not showcase, however, was one of its newest — and most important — Chinese partners: Jiang Mianheng, the 61-year-old son of Jiang Zemin, the former Communist Party leader and the most powerful political kingmaker of China’s last two decades.
 
The younger Mr. Jiang’s coups have included ventures with Microsoft and Nokia and oversight of a clutch of state-backed investment vehicles that have major interests in telecommunications, semiconductors and construction projects.
 
That a dealmaker like Mr. Jiang would be included in an undertaking like that of DreamWorks is almost a given in today’s China. Analysts say this is how the Communist Party shares the spoils, allowing the relatives of senior leaders to cash in on one of the biggest economic booms in history.
 
As the scandal over Bo Xilai continues to reverberate, the authorities here are eager to paint Mr. Bo, a fallen leader who was one of 25 members of China’s ruling Politburo, as a rogue operator who abused his power, even as his family members accumulated a substantial fortune.
 
But evidence is mounting that the relatives of other current and former senior officials have also amassed vast wealth, often playing central roles in businesses closely entwined with the state, including those involved in finance, energy, domestic security, telecommunications and entertainment. Many of these so-called princelings also serve as middlemen to a host of global companies and wealthy tycoons eager to do business in China.
 
“Whenever there is something profitable that emerges in the economy, they’ll be at the front of the queue,” said Minxin Pei, an expert on China’s leadership and professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. “They’ve gotten into private equity, state-owned enterprises, natural resources — you name it.”
 
For example, Wen Yunsong, the son of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, heads a state-owned company that boasts that it will soon be Asia’s largest satellite communications operator. President Hu Jintao’s son, Hu Haifeng, once managed a state-controlled firm that held a monopoly on security scanners used in China’s airports, shipping ports and subway stations. And in 2006, Feng Shaodong, the son-in-law of Wu Bangguo, the party’s second-ranking official, helped Merrill Lynch win a deal to arrange the $22 billion public listing of the giant state-run bank I.C.B.C., in what became the world’s largest initial public stock offering.
 
Much of the income earned by families of senior leaders may be entirely legal. But it is all but impossible to distinguish between legitimate and ill-gotten gains because there is no public disclosure of the wealth of officials and their relatives. Conflict-of-interest laws are weak or nonexistent. And the business dealings of the political elite are heavily censored in the state-controlled news media.
 
The spoils system, for all the efforts to keep a lid on it, poses a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the Communist Party. As the state’s business has become increasingly intertwined with a class of families sometimes called the Red Nobility, analysts say the potential exists for a backlash against an increasingly entrenched elite. They also point to the risk that national policies may be subverted by leaders and former leaders, many of whom exert influence long after their retirement, acting to protect their own interests.
 
Chinese officials and their relatives rarely discuss such a delicate issue publicly. The New York Times made repeated attempts to reach public officials and their relatives for this article, often through their companies. None of those reached agreed to comment on the record.
 
DreamWorks and Microsoft declined to comment about their relationship with Mr. Jiang.
 
A secret United States State Department cable from 2009, released two years ago by the WikiLeaks project, cited reports that China’s ruling elite had carved up the country’s economic pie. At the same time, many companies openly boast that their ties to the political elite give them a competitive advantage in China’s highly regulated marketplace.
 
A Chinese sportswear company called Xidelong, for example, proudly informed some potential investors that one of its shareholders was the son of Wen Jiabao, according to one of the investors. (A private equity firm, New Horizon, that the son, Wen Yunsong helped found invested in the company in 2009, according to Xidelong’s Web site.) “There are so many ways to partner with the families of those in power,” said one finance executive who has worked with the relatives of senior leaders. “Just make them part of your deal; it’s perfectly legal.”
 
Worried about the appearance of impropriety and growing public disgust with official corruption, the Communist Party has repeatedly revised its ethics codes and tightened financial disclosure rules. In its latest iteration, the party in 2010 required all officials to report the jobs, whereabouts and investments of their spouses and children, as well as their own incomes. But the disclosure reports remain secret; proposals to make them public have been shelved repeatedly by the party-controlled legislature.
 
The party is unlikely to move more aggressively because families of high-ranking past and current officials are now deeply embedded in the economic fabric of the nation. Over the past two decades, business and politics have become so tightly intertwined, they say, that the Communist Party has effectively institutionalized an entire ecosystem of crony capitalism. “They don’t want to bring this into the open,” said Roderick MacFarquhar, a China specialist at Harvard University. “It would be a tsunami.”
 
Critics charge that powerful vested interests are now strong enough to block reforms that could benefit the larger populace. Changes in banking and financial services, for instance, could affect the interests of the family of Zhu Rongji, China’s prime minister from 1998 to 2003 and one of the architects of China’s economic system. His son, Levin Zhu, joined China International Capital Corporation, one of the country’s biggest investment banks, in 1998 and has served as its chief executive for the past decade.
 
Efforts to open the power sector to competition, for example, could affect the interests of relatives of Li Peng, a former prime minister. Li Xiaolin, his daughter, is the chairwoman and chief executive of China Power International, the flagship of one of the big five power generating companies in China. Her brother, Li Xiaopeng, was formerly the head of another big power company and is now a public official.
 
“This is one of the most difficult challenges China faces,” said Mr. Pei, an authority on China’s leadership. “Whenever they want to implement reform, their children might say, ‘Dad, what about my business?’ ”
 
There are also growing concerns that a culture of nepotism and privilege nurtured at the top of the system has flowed downward, permeating bureaucracies at every level of government in China. “After a while you realize, wow, there are actually a lot of princelings out there,” said Victor Shih, a China scholar at Northwestern University near Chicago, using the label commonly slapped on descendants of party leaders. “You’ve got the children of current officials, the children of previous officials, the children of local officials, central officials, military officers, police officials.We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people out there — all trying to use their connections to make money.”
 
To shore up confidence in the government’s ability to tackle the problem, high-ranking leaders regularly inveigh against greedy officials caught with their hand in the till. In 2008, for instance, a former Shanghai Party secretary, Chen Liangyu, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for bribery and abuse of power. One of his crimes was pressing businessmen to funnel benefits to his close relatives, including a land deal that netted his brother, Chen Liangjun, a $20 million profit.
 
But exposés in the foreign press — like the report in 2010 that Zeng Wei, the son of China’s former vice president Zeng Qinghong, bought a $32 million mansion in Sydney, Australia — are ignored by the Chinese-language news media and blocked by Internet censors.
 
Allegations of bribery and corruption against the nation’s top leaders typically follow — rather than precede — a fall from political grace. Mr. Bo’s downfall this spring, for instance, came after his former police chief in Chongqing told American diplomats that Mr. Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, had ordered the murder of Neil Heywood, a British businessman, in a dispute over the family’s business interests.
 
Evidence has surfaced of at least $160 million in assets held by close relatives of Bo Xilai, and the authorities are investigating whether other assets held by the family may have been secretly and illegally moved offshore.
 
Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, responded by demanding a more forceful crackdown on corruption. Without naming Mr. Bo by name, People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, denounced fortune seekers who stain the party’s purity by smuggling ill-gotten gains out of the country.
 
Some scholars argue that the party is now hostage to its own unholy alliances. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said it would be difficult for the Chinese government to push through major political reforms aimed at extricating powerful political families from business without giving immunity to those now in power.
 
And with no independent judiciary in China, he said, party leaders would essentially be charged with investigating themselves. “The party has said anticorruption efforts are a life-and-death issue,” Mr. Li said. “But if they want to clean house, it may be fatal.”
 
Chinese tycoons have also been quietly welcomed into the families of senior leaders, often through secret partnerships in which the sons, daughters, spouses and close relatives act as middlemen or co-investors in real estate projects or other deals that need government approval or backing, according to investors who have been involved in such transactions.
 
Moreover, China’s leading political families, often through intermediaries, hold secret shares in dozens of companies, including many that are publicly listed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and elsewhere, according to interviews with bankers and investment advisers. Lately, the progeny of the political elite have retooled the spoils system for a new era, moving into high-finance ventures like private equity funds, where the potential returns dwarf the benefits from serving as a middleman to government contracts or holding an executive post at a state monopoly.
 
Jeffrey Zeng, the son of the former Politburo member Zeng Peiyan, is a managing partner at Kaixin Investments, a venture-capital firm set up with two state-owned entities, China Development Bank and Citic Capital. Liu Lefei, the son of another Politburo member, Liu Yunshan, helps operate the $4.8 billion Citic Private Equity Fund, one of the biggest state-managed funds. Last year, Alvin Jiang, the grandson of former president Jiang Zemin, the former Communist Party leader and president, helped establish Boyu Capital, a private equity firm that is on its way to raising at least $1 billion.
 
Most recently, with the Communist Party promising to overhaul the nation’s media and cultural industries, the relatives of China’s political elite are at the head of the crowd scrambling for footholds in a new frontier.
 
The February announcement of the deal between DreamWorks and three Chinese partners, including Shanghai Alliance Investment, was timed to coincide with the high-profile visit to the United States of Xi Jinping, China’s vice president and presumptive next president. The news release did not mention that Shanghai Alliance is partly controlled by Jiang Zemin’s son Jiang Mianheng. A person who answered the telephone at the Shanghai Alliance office here declined to comment.
 
Zeng Qinghuai, the brother of Zeng Qinghong, China’s former vice president, is also in the film business. He served as a consultant for the patriotic epic “Beginning of the Great Revival.” The film exemplified the hand-in-glove relationship between business and politics. It was shown on nearly 90,000 movie screens across the country. Government offices and schools were ordered to buy tickets in bulk. The media was banned from criticizing it. It became one of last year’s top-grossing films.
 
Scholars describe the film industry as the new playground for princelings. Zhang Xiaojin, director of the Center of Political Development at Tsinghua University, said, “There are cases where propaganda department officials specifically ask their children to make films which they then approve.”
 
Zhao Xiao, an economist at the University of Science and Technology in Beijing, said, “They are everywhere, as long as the industry is profitable.”"
188,NYT,David Barboza,2013,Corruption Chica,"Relatives of a top Chinese regulator profited enormously from the purchase of shares in a once-struggling insurance company that is now one of China’s biggest financial powerhouses, according to interviews and a review of regulatory filings.
 
The regulator, Dai Xianglong, was the head of China’s central bank and also had oversight of the insurance industry in 2002, when a company his relatives helped control bought a big stake in Ping An Insurance that years later came to be worth billions of dollars. The insurer was drawing new investors ahead of a public stock offering after averting insolvency a few years earlier.
 
With growing attention on the wealth amassed by families of the politically powerful in China, the investments of Mr. Dai’s relatives illustrate that the riches extend beyond the families of the political elites to the families of regulators with control of the country’s most important business and financial levers. Mr. Dai, an economist, has since left his post with the central bank and now manages the country’s $150 billion social security fund, one of the world’s biggest investment funds.
 
How much the relatives made in the deal is not known, but analysts say the activity raises further doubts about whether the capital markets are sufficiently regulated in China.
 
Nicholas C. Howson, an expert in Chinese securities law at the University of Michigan Law School, said: “While not per se illegal or even evidence of corruption, these transactions feed into a problematic perception that is widespread in the P.R.C.: the relatives of China’s highest officials are given privileged access to pre-I.P.O. properties.” He was using the abbreviation for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.
 
The company that bought the Ping An stake was controlled by a group of investment firms, including two set up by Mr. Dai’s son-in-law, Che Feng, as well as other firms associated with Mr. Che’s relatives and business associates, the regulatory filings show.
 
The company, Dinghe Venture Capital, got the shares for an extremely good price, the records show, paying a small fraction of what a large British bank had paid per share just two months earlier. The company paid $55 million for its Ping An shares on Dec. 26, 2002. By 2007, the last time the value of the investment was made public, the shares were worth $3.1 billion.
 
In its investigation, The New York Times found no indication that Mr. Dai had been aware of his relatives’ activities, or that any law had been broken. But the relatives appeared to have made a fortune by investing in financial services companies over which Mr. Dai had regulatory authority.
 
In another instance, in November 2002, Dinghe acquired a big stake in Haitong Securities, a brokerage firm that also fell under Mr. Dai’s jurisdiction, according to the brokerage firm’s Shanghai prospectus.
 
By 2007, just after Haitong’s public listing in Shanghai, those shares were worth about $1 billion, according to public filings. Later, between 2007 and 2010, Mr. Dai’s wife, Ke Yongzhen, was chairwoman on Haitong’s board of supervisors.
 
A spokesman for Mr. Dai and the National Social Security Fund did not return phone calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Che, the son-in-law, denied by e-mail that he had ever held a stake in Ping An. The spokeswoman said another businessman had bought the Ping An shares and then, facing financial difficulties, sold them to a group that included Mr. Che’s friends and relatives, but not Mr. Che.
 
The businessman “could not afford what he has created, so he had to sell his shares all at once,” the spokeswoman, Jenny Lau, wrote in an e-mail.
 
The corporate records reviewed by The Times, however, show that Mr. Che, his relatives and longtime business associates set up a complex web of companies that effectively gave him and the others control of Dinghe Venture Capital, which made the investments in Ping An and Haitong Securities. The records show that one of the companies later nominated Mr. Che to serve on the Ping An board of supervisors. His term ran from 2006 to 2009.
 
The Times reported last month that another investment company had also bought shares in Ping An Insurance at an unusually low price on the same day in 2002 as Dinghe Venture Capital. That company, Tianjin Taihong, was later partly controlled by relatives of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, then serving as vice premier with oversight of China’s financial institutions. In late 2007, the shares Taihong bought in Ping An were valued at $3.7 billion.
 
The investments by Dinghe and Taihong are significant in part because by late 2002, Beijing regulators had granted Ping An an unusual waiver to rules that would have forced the insurer to sell off some divisions. Throughout the late 1990s, the company was fighting rules that would have required a breakup, a move that Ping An executives worried could lead to bankruptcy.
 
It is unclear whether Mr. Wen or Mr. Dai intervened on behalf of Ping An, but in April 2002 the company was allowed to reorganize and retain its brokerage and trust division. Two years later, Ping An sold shares to the public for the first time in Hong Kong. In 2007, after a second stock listing in Shanghai, the value of the company’s shares skyrocketed. Today, Ping An is one of the world’s biggest financial institutions, worth an estimated $65 billion.
 
The decision to grant the waiver came after Ping An executives and the insurer’s bankers had aggressively lobbied regulators, including Mr. Dai.
 
The Times reviewed copies of letters written to Mr. Dai. In one, Ma Mingzhe, the chairman of Ping An, pleaded with Mr. Dai to approve an overseas stock offering in 1998, saying, “It would be rather difficult to raise such a huge amount of money in the domestic market.”
 
The regulatory filings show that Dinghe, the company partly controlled by Mr. Dai’s relatives, got an extremely good deal on the shares of Ping An it had bought. In December 2002, Dinghe bought 66.5 million shares from Cosco, a Chinese state-owned shipping giant, paying about 40 cents a share, after adjusting for a later stock split, according to public filings and a report in a state-run newspaper. It was the same price paid by Taihong, the company affiliated with the relatives of Mr. Wen.
 
The price was much lower than what the British bank HSBC paid for a 10 percent stake in Ping An in October of that year. HSBC paid what at today’s exchange rates would be $1.60 a share.
 
It is unclear why Cosco would have sold Ping An shares at such a substantial discount. Cosco did not return calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Ping An also did not return calls.
 
Mr. Dai, 68, has had a long career as a government regulator and an executive at state-owned companies. He held high-level positions at the Agricultural Bank of China, China Pacific Insurance and, in the early 1990s, at the Bank of Communications, where he oversaw Haitong Securities, the bank’s brokerage division.
 
In 1995, he was appointed head of China’s central bank, one of the nation’s most powerful financial posts. He stepped down in December 2002 to become mayor of Tianjin. Then, in 2008, he became head of the National Council for Social Security Fund. During much of his career, he developed close ties with senior Chinese leaders, including Mr. Wen, who served with him on the powerful Central Financial Work Commission. The commission oversaw China’s banking, securities and insurance regulators, and the biggest financial institutions.
 
Big financial services companies also sought Mr. Dai’s aid in navigating the state’s tight regulatory environment. For instance, Ping An’s longtime chairman, Mr. Ma, kept a telephone directory with Mr. Dai’s name, as well as the name of his wife and son-in-law, according to records reviewed by The Times and an interview with a former staff assistant to Mr. Ma.
 
In addition, Li Chunyan, who once ran Ping An’s Beijing office, said last month in a telephone interview that he had set up meetings between Mr. Ma and relatives of Mr. Dai, including his son-in-law, Mr. Che.
 
“I wouldn’t say I introduced them, but I brought them,” he said, declining to give details. “I’m just a small potato, you know.” He added, “I’m very familiar with the family of Mr. Dai.”
 
Later, at the National Council for Social Security Fund, Mr. Dai began overseeing a huge fund that has acquired stakes in Haitong and Ping An. Last September, the government-controlled social security fund said it would allocate $3.6 billion to a group of 16 Chinese private equity funds, including New Horizon Capital, a fund whose founders include Wen Yunsong, the only son of the prime minister."
189,Reuters,Szep,2014,Myanmar Rohingya,"The beatings were accompanied by threats: If his family didn't produce the money, Myanmar refugee Abdul Sabur would be sold into slavery on a fishing boat, his captors shouted, lashing him with bamboo sticks.

It had been more than two months since Sabur and his wife set sail from Myanmar with 118 other Rohingya Muslims to escape violence and persecution. Twelve died on the disastrous voyage. The survivors were imprisoned in India and then handed over to people smugglers in southern Thailand.

As the smugglers beat Sabur in their jungle hide-out, they kept a phone line open so that his relatives could hear his screams and speed up payment of $1,800 to secure his release.

""Every time there was a delay or problem with the payment they would hurt us again,"" said Sabur, a tall fisherman from Myanmar's western Rakhine state.

He was part of the swelling flood of Rohingya who have fled Myanmar by sea this past year, in one of the biggest movements of boat people since the Vietnam War ended.

Their fast-growing exodus is a sign of Muslim desperation in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, also known as Burma. Ethnic and religious tensions simmered during 49 years of military rule. But under the reformist government that took power in March 2011, Myanmar has endured its worst communal bloodshed in generations.

A Reuters investigation, based on interviews with people smugglers and more than two dozen survivors of boat voyages, reveals how some Thai naval security forces work systematically with smugglers to profit from the surge in fleeing Rohingya. The lucrative smuggling network transports the Rohingya mainly into neighboring Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country they view as a haven from persecution.

Once in the smugglers' hands, Rohingya men are often beaten until they come up with the money for their passage. Those who can't pay are handed over to traffickers, who sometimes sell the men as indentured servants on farms or into slavery on Thai fishing boats. There, they become part of the country's $8 billion seafood-export business, which supplies consumers in the United States, Japan and Europe.

Some Rohingya women are sold as brides, Reuters found. Other Rohingya languish in overcrowded Thai and Malaysian immigration detention centers.

Reuters reconstructed one deadly journey by 120 Rohingya, tracing their dealings with smugglers through interviews with the passengers and their families. They included Sabur and his 46-year-old mother-in-law Sabmeraz; Rahim, a 22-year-old rice farmer, and his friend Abdul Hamid, 27; and Abdul Rahim, 27, a shopkeeper.

While the death toll on their boat was unusually high, the accounts of mistreatment by authorities and smugglers were similar to those of survivors from other boats interviewed by Reuters.

The Rohingya exodus, and the state measures that fuel it, undermine Myanmar's carefully crafted image of ethnic reconciliation and stability that helped persuade the United States and Europe to suspend most sanctions.

At least 800 people, mostly Rohingya, have died at sea after their boats broke down or capsized in the past year, says the Arakan Project, an advocacy group that has studied Rohingya migration since 2006. The escalating death toll prompted the United Nations this year to call that part of the Indian Ocean one of world's ""deadliest stretches of water.""

EXTENDED FAMILIES
For more than a decade, Rohingya men have set sail in search of work in neighboring countries. A one-way voyage typically costs about 200,000 kyat, or $205, a small fortune by local standards. The extended Rohingya families who raise the sum regard it as an investment; many survive off money sent from relatives overseas.

The number boarding boats from Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh reached 34,626 people from June 2012 to May of this year - more than four times the previous year, says the Arakan Project. Almost all are Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar. Unprecedented numbers of women and children are making these dangerous voyages.

A sophisticated smuggling industry is developing around them, drawing in other refugees across South Asia. Ramshackle fishing boats are being replaced by cargo ships crewed by smugglers and teeming with passengers. In June alone, six such ships disgorged hundreds of Rohingya and other refugees on remote Thai islands controlled by smugglers, the Arakan Project said.

Sabur and the others who sailed on the doomed 35-foot fishing boat came from Rakhine, a rugged coastal state where Rohingya claim a centuries-old lineage. The government calls them illegal ""Bengali"" migrants from Bangladesh who arrived during British rule in the 19th century. Most of the 1.1 million Rohingya of Rakhine state are denied citizenship and refused passports.

Machete-wielding Rakhine Buddhists destroyed Sabur's village last October, forcing him to abandon his home south of Sittwe, capital of Rakhine state. Last year's communal unrest in Rakhine made 140,000 homeless, most of them Rohingya. Myanmar's government says 192 people died; Rohingya activists put the toll as high as 748.

Before the violence, the Rohingya were the poorest people in the second-poorest state of Southeast Asia's poorest country. Today, despite Myanmar's historic reforms, they are worse off.

Tens of thousands live in squalid, disease-ridden displacement camps on the outskirts of Sittwe. Armed checkpoints prevent them from returning to the paddy fields and markets on which their livelihoods depend. Rohingya families in some areas have been banned from having more than two children.

Sabur's 33-member extended family spent several months wandering between camps before the family patriarch, an Islamic teacher in Malaysia named Arif Ali, helped them buy a fishing boat. They planned to sail straight to Malaysia to avoid Thailand's notorious smugglers.

Dozens of other paying passengers signed up for the voyage, along with an inexperienced captain who steered them to disaster.

""DYING, ONE BY ONE""
The small fishing boat set off from Myengu Island near Sittwe on February 15. The first two days went smoothly. Passengers huddled in groups, eating rice, dried fish and potatoes cooked in small pots over firewood. Space was so tight no one could stretch their legs while sleeping, said Rahim, the rice farmer, who like many Rohingya Muslims goes by one name.

Rahim's last few months had been horrific. A Rakhine mob killed his older brother in October and burned his family's rice farm to the ground. He spent two months in jail and was never told why. ""The charge seemed to be that I was a young man,"" he said. Rakhine state authorities have acknowledged arresting Rohingya men deemed a threat to security.

High seas and gusting winds nearly swamped the boat on the third day. The captain seemed to panic, survivors said. Fearing the ship would capsize, he dumped five bags of rice and two water tanks overboard — half their supplies.

It steadied, but it was soon clear they had another problem - the captain admitted he was lost. By February 24, after more than a week at sea, supplies of water, food and fuel were gone.

""People started dying, one by one,"" said Sabmeraz, the grandmother.

The Islamic janaza funeral prayer was whispered over the washed and shrouded corpses of four women and two children who died first. Among them: Sabmeraz's daughter and two young grandchildren.

""We thought we would all die,"" Sabmeraz recalled.

Many gulped sea water, making them even weaker. Some drank their own urine. The sick relieved themselves where they lay. Floorboards became slick with vomit and feces. Some people appeared wild-eyed before losing consciousness ""like they had gone mad,"" said Abdul Hamid.

On the morning of the 12th day, the shopkeeper Abdul Rahim wrapped his two-year-old daughter, Mozia, in cloth, performed funeral rites and slipped her tiny body into the sea. The next morning he did the same for his wife, Muju.

His father, Furkan, had warned Abdul Rahim not to take the two children - Mozia and her five-year-old sister, Morja. The family had been better off than most Rohingya. They owned a popular hardware store in Sittwe district. After it was reduced to rubble in the June violence, they moved into a camp.

On the night Abdul Rahim was leaving, Furkan recalls pleading with him on the jetty: ""If you want to go, you can go. But leave our grandchildren with us.""

Abdul Rahim refused. ""I've lost everything, my house, my job,"" he recalls replying. ""What else can I do?""

On February 28, hours after Abdul Rahim's wife died, the refugees spotted a Singapore-owned tugboat, the Star Jakarta. It was pulling an empty Indian-owned barge, the Ganpati, en route to Mumbai from Myanmar. The refugee men shouted but the slow-moving barge didn't stop.

But as the Ganpati moved by, a dozen Rohingya men jumped into the sea with a rope. They swam to the barge, fixed the rope and towed their boat close behind so people could board. By evening, 108 of them were on the barge.

Mohammed Salim, a soccer-loving grocery clerk, and a young woman, both in their 20s, were too weak to move. Close to death, they were cut adrift; the boat took on water and submerged in the rough seas.

""He was our hope,"" said Salim's father, Mohammad Kassim, 71, who emptied his savings to pay the 500,000 kyat ($515) cost of the journey.

Of the 12 who died on the boat, 11 were women and children.

MISTAKEN FOR PIRATES
What happened next shows how the problems of reform-era Myanmar are rapidly becoming Asia's.

The tugboat captain mistook the Rohingya for pirates and radioed for help, said Bhavna Dayal, a spokeswoman for Punj Lloyd Group, the Indian company that owns the barge. Within hours, an Indian Coast Guard ship arrived. Officers fired into the air and ordered the Rohingya to the floor.

Rahim, the rice farmer, said he and five others were beaten with a rubber baton. With the help of some Hindi picked up from Bollywood films, they explained they were fleeing the strife in Rakhine state. After that, everyone received food, water and first aid, he said.

Another Indian Coast Guard ship, the Aruna Asaf Ali, arrived. It took the women and children to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, an Indian archipelago a short voyage to the south, before returning for the men.

In Diglipur, the largest town in North Andaman Island, immigration authorities separated the men from women and children, putting them all in cells. Guards beat them at will, Rahim said, and rummaged through their belongings for money. He lost 60,000 kyat ($62) and hid his remaining 60,000 kyat in a crack in a wall.

Rupinder Singh, the police superintendent in Diglipur, denied anyone was beaten or robbed.

After about a month, the Rohingya were moved to a bigger detention center near the state capital Port Blair. They joined about 300 other Muslims, mostly Rohingya from Myanmar, who had been rescued at sea. The men went on a one-day hunger strike, demanding to be sent to Malaysia.

The protest seemed to work. Indian authorities brought all 420 of them into international waters and transferred them to a double-decker ferry, said the Rohingya passengers.

""They told us this ship would take us straight to Malaysia,"" said Sabur.

It was run, however, by Thailand-based smugglers, he said.

Commander P.V.S. Satish, speaking for the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard, said there was ""absolutely no truth"" to the allegation that the Navy handed the Rohingya to smugglers.

After four days at sea, the Rohingya approached Thailand's southern Satun province around April 18. They were split into smaller boats. Some were taken to small islands, others to the mainland. The smugglers explained they needed to recoup the 10 million kyat ($10,300) they had paid for renting the ferry.

ECONOMICS OF TRAFFICKING
Thailand portrays itself as an accidental destination for Malaysia-bound Rohingya: They wash ashore and then flee or get detained.

In truth, Thailand is a smuggler's paradise, and the stateless Rohingya are big business. Smugglers seek them out, aware their relatives will pay to move them on. This can blur the lines between smuggling and trafficking.

Smuggling, done with the consent of those involved, differs from trafficking, the business of trapping people by force or deception into labor or prostitution. The distinction is critical.

An annual U.S. State Department report, monitoring global efforts to combat modern slavery, has for the last four years kept Thailand on a so-called Tier 2 Watch List, a notch above the worst offenders, such as North Korea. A drop to Tier 3 can trigger sanctions, including the blocking of World Bank aid.

A veteran smuggler in Thailand described the economics of the trade in a rare interview. Each adult Rohingya is valued at up to $2,000, yielding smugglers a net profit of 10,000 baht ($320) after bribes and other costs, the smuggler said. In addition to the Royal Thai Navy, the seas are patrolled by the Thai Marine Police and by local militias under the control of military commanders.

""Ten years ago, the money went directly to the brokers. Now it goes to all these officials as well,"" said the smuggler, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

A broker in Myanmar typically sends a passenger list with a departure date to a counterpart in Thailand, the smuggler said. Thai navy or militia commanders are then notified to intercept boats and sometimes guide them to pre-arranged spots, said the smuggler.

The Thai naval forces usually earn about 2,000 baht ($65) per Rohingya for spotting a boat or turning a blind eye, said the smuggler, who works in the southern Thai region of Phang Nga and deals directly with the navy and police.

Police receive 5,000 baht ($160) per Rohingya, or about 500,000 baht ($16,100) for a boat of 100, the smuggler said.

Another smuggler, himself a Rohingya based in Kuala Lumpur, said Thai naval forces help guide boatloads to arranged spots. He said his group maintains close phone contact with local commanders. He estimated his group has smuggled up to 4,000 people into Malaysia in the past six months.

Relatives in Malaysia must make an initial deposit of 3,000 ringgit ($950) into Malaysian bank accounts, he said, followed by a second payment for the same amount once the refugees reach the country.

Naval ships do not always work with the smugglers. Some follow Thailand's official ""help on"" policy, whereby Rohingya boats are supplied with fuel and provisions on condition they sail onward.

The Thai navy and police denied any involvement in Rohingya smuggling. Manasvi Srisodapol, a Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that there has been no evidence of the navy trafficking or abusing Rohingya for several years.

CAGES AND THREATS
Anti-trafficking campaigners have produced mounting evidence of the widespread use of slave labor from countries such as Myanmar on Thai fishing boats, which face an acute labor shortage.

Fishing companies buy Rohingya men for between 10,000 baht ($320) and 20,000 baht ($640), depending on age and strength, said the smuggler in Phang Nga. He recounted sales of Rohingya in the past year to Indonesian and Singapore fishing firms.

This has made the industry a major source of U.S. concern over Thailand's record on human trafficking. About 8 percent of Thai seafood exports go to supermarkets and restaurants in the United States, the second biggest export market after Japan.

The Thai government has said it is serious about tackling human trafficking, though no government minister has publicly acknowledged that slavery exists in the fishing industry.

Sabur, his wife Monzurah and more than a dozen Rohingya thought slavery might be their fate. The smugglers held them on the Thai island for five weeks. The captors said they would be sold to fisheries, pig farms or plantations if money didn't arrive soon.

""We were too scared to sleep at night,"" said Monzurah, 19 years old.

Arif Ali, the family patriarch in Kuala Lumpur, managed to raise about $21,000 to secure the release of 19 of his relatives, including his sister Sabmeraz, Sabur, and Monzurah. They were taken on foot across the border into Malaysia in May. But 10 of the family, all men, remained imprisoned on the island as he struggled to raise more funds.

As Ali was interviewed in early June, his cellphone rang and he had a brief, heated conversation. ""They call every day,"" he said. ""They say if we call the police they will kill them.""

Some women without money are sold as brides for 50,000 baht ($1,600) each, typically to Rohingya men in Malaysia, the Thai smuggler said. Refugees who are caught and detained by Thai authorities also face the risk of abuse.

At a detention center in Phang Nga in southern Thailand, 269 Rohingya men and boys lived in cage-like cells that stank of sweat and urine when a Reuters journalist visited recently. Most had been there six months. Some used crutches because their muscles had atrophied.

""Every day we ask when we can leave this place, but we have no idea if that will ever happen,"" said Faizal Haq, 14.

 

They are among about 2,000 Rohingya held in 24 immigration detention centers across Thailand, according to the Thai government.

""To be honest, we really don't know what to do with them,"" said one immigration official who declined to be named. Myanmar has rejected a Thai request to repatriate them.

Dozens of Rohingya have escaped detention centers. The Thai smuggler said some immigration officials will free Rohingya for a price. Thailand's Foreign Ministry denied immigration officials take payments from smugglers.

PROMISED LAND
When Rahim, Abdul Hamid and the other Rohingya finally arrived in Thailand, smugglers met them in Satun province, which borders Malaysia.

They were herded into pickup trucks and driven to a farm, where they say they saw the smugglers negotiate with Thai police and immigration officials. The smugglers told them to contact relatives in Malaysia who could pay the roughly 6,000 ringgit ($1,800).

""If you run away, the police and immigration will bring you back to us. We paid them to do that,"" the most senior smuggler told them, the two men recalled.

After 22 days at the farm, Rahim and Hamid escaped. It was near midnight when they darted across a field, cleared a barbed-wire fence and ran into the jungle. They wandered for a day, hungry and lost, before meeting a Burmese man who found them work on a fruit farm in Padang Besar near the Thai-Malaysia border. They still work there today, hoping to save enough money to leave Thailand.

If the smugglers get paid, they usually take the Rohingya across southern Thailand in pickup trucks, 16 at a time, with just enough space to breathe, the smuggler in Thailand said. They are hidden under containers of fish, shrimp or other food, and sent through police checkpoints at 1,000 baht ($32) apiece, the smuggler said. Once close to Malaysia, the final crossing of the border is usually made by foot.

Abdul Rahim, the shopkeeper who lost his wife and toddler, arranged a quick payment to the smugglers from relatives in Kuala Lumpur. He was soon on a boat to Malaysia with his surviving daughter and his sister-in-law, Ruksana. They were dropped off around April 20 at a remote spot in Malaysia's northern Penang island.

For Abdul Rahim and many other Rohingya, Malaysia was the promised land. For most, that hope fades quickly.

At best, they can register with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and receive a card that gives them minimal legal protection and a chance for a low-paid job such as construction. While Malaysia has won praise for accepting Rohingya refugees, it has not signed the U.N. Refugee Convention that would oblige it to give them fuller rights.

Those picked up by Malaysian authorities face weeks or months in packed detention camps, where several witnesses said beatings and insufficient food were common. The Malaysian government did not comment on conditions in the camps.

The UNHCR has registered 28,000 Rohingya asylum seekers out of nearly 95,000 Myanmar refugees in Malaysia, many of whom have been in the country for years. An estimated 49,000 unregistered asylum seekers can wait months or years for a coveted UNHCR card. The card gives asylum seekers discounted treatment at public hospitals, is recognized by many employers, and gives protection against repatriation.

The vast majority, like Sabur, Abdul Rahim and their families, don't obtain these minimal protections. They evade detention in the camps but live in fear of arrest.

By early July, Sabur had found temporary work in an iron foundry on Kuala Lumpur's outskirts earning about $10 a day. He will likely have to save for years to pay back the money that secured his release.

Abdul Rahim's family now lives in a small, windowless room in a city suburb. His late wife's sister, Ruksana, coughed up blood during one interview, but is afraid to seek medical help without documentation.

By early July, Abdul Rahim had married Ruksana. He was picking up occasional odd jobs through friends but was struggling to pay the $80 a month rent on their shabby room. Despite that, and the loss of his first wife and daughter, he still believes he made the right decision to flee Myanmar.

""I don't regret coming,"" he said, ""but I regret what happened. I think about my wife and daughter all day."""
190,Reuters,Szep,2014,Myanmar Rohingya," One afternoon in October, in the watery no-man's land between Thailand and Myanmar, Muhammad Ismail vanished.

Thai immigration officials said he was being deported to Myanmar. In fact, they sold Ismail, 23, and hundreds of other Rohingya Muslims to human traffickers, who then spirited them into brutal jungle camps.

As thousands of Rohingya flee Myanmar to escape religious persecution, a Reuters investigation in three countries has uncovered a clandestine policy to remove Rohingya refugees from Thailand's immigration detention centers and deliver them to human traffickers waiting at sea.

The Rohingya are then transported across southern Thailand and held hostage in a series of camps hidden near the border with Malaysia until relatives pay thousands of dollars to release them. Reporters located three such camps - two based on the testimony of Rohingya held there, and a third by trekking to the site, heavily guarded, near a village called Baan Klong Tor.

Thousands of Rohingya have passed through this tropical gulag. An untold number have died there. Some have been murdered by camp guards or have perished from dehydration or disease, survivors said in interviews.

The Thai authorities say the movement of Rohingya through their country doesn't amount to human trafficking. But in interviews for this story, the Thai Royal Police acknowledged, for the first time, a covert policy called ""option two"" that relies upon established human-smuggling networks to rid Thailand of Rohingya detainees.

Ismail was one of five Rohingya who said that Thai immigration officials had sold him outright or aided in their sale to human traffickers. ""It seemed so official at first,"" said Ismail, a wiry farmer with a long narrow face and tight curly hair. ""They took our photographs. They took our fingerprints. And then once in the boats, about 20 minutes out at sea, we were told we had been sold.""

Ismail said he ended up in a camp in southern Thailand. So did Bozor Mohamed, a Rohingya whose frail body makes him seem younger than his 21 years. The camp was guarded by men with guns and clubs, said Mohamed, and at least one person died every day due to dehydration or disease.

""I used to be a strong man,"" the former rice farmer said in an interview, as he massaged his withered legs.

Mohamed and others say they endured hunger, filth and multiple beatings. Mohamed's elbow and back are scarred from what he said were beatings administered by his captors in Thailand while he telephoned his brother-in-law in Malaysia, begging him to pay the $2,000 ransom they demanded. Some men failed to find a benefactor in Malaysia to pay their ransom. The camp became their home. ""They had long beards and their hair was so long, down to the middle of their backs, that they looked liked women,"" said Mohamed.

""HOLDING BAYS""
What ultimately happens to Rohingya who can't buy their freedom remains unclear. A Thai-based smuggler said some are sold to shipping companies and farms as manual laborers for 5,000 to 50,000 baht each, or $155 to $1,550.

""Prices vary according to their skills,"" said the smuggler, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Arakan Project, a Rohingya advocacy group based in Thailand, says it has interviewed scores of Rohingya who have passed through the Thai camps and into Malaysia. Many Rohingya who can't pay end up as cooks or guards at the camps, said Chris Lewa, Arakan Project's director.

Presented with the findings of this report, Thailand's second-highest-ranking policeman made some startling admissions. Thai officials might have profited from Rohingya smuggling in the past, said Police Maj-Gen Chatchawal Suksomjit, Deputy Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police. He also confirmed the existence of illegal camps in southern Thailand, which he called ""holding bays"".

Tarit Pengdith, chief of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand's equivalent of the U.S. FBI, was also asked about the camps Reuters discovered. ""We have heard about these camps in southern Thailand,"" he said, ""but we are not investigating this issue.""

Besieged by a political crisis and violent street protests this week, Thailand faces difficult questions about its future and global status. Among those is whether it will join North Korea, the Central African Republic and Iran among the world's worst offenders in fighting human trafficking.

The signs are not good.

The U.S. State Department's annual Trafficking In Persons (TIP) report ranks countries on their record for combating the crime. For the past four years, Thailand has sat on the TIP Report's so-called Tier 2 Watch List, the second-lowest rank. It will be automatically downgraded to Tier 3 next year unless it makes what the State Department calls ""significant efforts"" to eliminate human trafficking.

Dropping to Tier 3 status theoretically carries the threat of U.S. sanctions. In practice, the United States is unlikely to sanction Thailand, one of its oldest treaty allies in Asia. But to be downgraded would be a major embarrassment to Thailand, which is now lobbying hard for a non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council.

THE ROHINGYA EXODUS
Rohingya are Muslims from Myanmar and Bangladesh, where they are usually stateless and despised as illegal immigrants. In 2012, two eruptions of violence between Rohingyas and majority Buddhists in Rakhine State in western Myanmar killed at least 192 people and made 140,000 homeless. Most were Rohingya, who live in wretched camps or under apartheid-like segregation with little access to healthcare, schools or jobs.

And so they have fled Myanmar by sea in unprecedented numbers over the past year. Ismail and Mohamed joined tens of thousands of Rohingya in one of the biggest movements of boat people since the end of the Vietnam War.

Widespread bias against the Rohingya in the region, however, makes it difficult for them to find safe haven - and easy to fall into the hands of traffickers. ""No one is there to speak for them,"" says Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. ""They are a lost people.""

Rohingya men, women and children squeeze aboard overloaded fishing boats and cargo ships to cross the Bay of Bengal. Their desired destination is Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country where at least 31,000 Rohingya already live. As Reuters reported in July, many of these refugees were waylaid in Thailand, where the Thai navy and marine police worked with smugglers to extract money for their onward trip to Malaysia.

Hundreds of Rohingyas were arrested in two headline-grabbing raids by the Thai authorities on January 9 in the towns of Padang Besar and Sadao, both near the Malaysia border. At the time, Colonel Krissakorn Paleetunyawong, deputy commander of police in the area, declared the Rohingya would be deported back to Myanmar. That never happened.

Ismail and Mohamed were among the 393 Rohingya that Thai police say were arrested that day in Padang Besar. So was Ismail's friend Ediris, 22. The three young men all hailed from Buthedaung, a poor township in northern Rakhine State.

Their story reveals how Thailand, a rapidly developing country in the heart of Southeast Asia, shifted from cracking down on human trafficking camps to facilitating them.

A SECRET POLICY
After their arrest, Ediris and Ismail were brought to an immigration detention center (IDC) in Sadao, where they joined another 300 Rohingya rounded up from a nearby smuggler's house. The two-story IDC, designed for a few dozen inmates, was overflowing. Women and children were moved to sheltered housing, while some men were sent to other IDCs across Thailand.

With about 1,700 Rohingya locked up nationwide, the Thai government set a July deadline to deport them all and opened talks with Myanmar on how to do it. The talks went nowhere, because the Myanmar government refused to take responsibility for what it regards as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Men and teenage boys languished for months in cramped, cage-like cells, often with barely enough room to sit or stand, much less walk. In June, Reuters journalists visited an IDC in Phang Nga, near the tourist Mecca of Phuket. There were 269 men and boys crammed into a space built for no more than 100. It reeked of urine and sweat. Some detainees used crutches because their muscles had atrophied.

A doctor who inspected Sadao's IDC in July said he found five emaciated Rohingya clinging to life. Two died on their way to hospital, said the doctor, Anatachai Thaipratan, an advisor of the Thai Islamic Medical Association.

As the plight of Rohingya detainees made world headlines, pressure mounted on Thailand. But Myanmar wouldn't take them, nor would Malaysia. With thousands more arriving, the U.N.'s refugee agency issued an urgent appeal for alternative housing. The government proposed building a ""mega camp"" in Nakhon Sri Thammarat, another province in southern Thailand. It was rejected after an outcry from local people.

In early August, 270 Rohingya rioted at the IDC in Phang Nga. Men tore off doors separating cells, demanding to be let outside to pray at the close of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Over the last three weeks of August, more than 300 Rohingya fled from five detention centers.

By this time, Mohamed, the 21-year-old refugee, could no longer walk, let alone escape. His leg muscles had wasted away from months in detention in a cell shared by 95 Rohingya men. Ismail and Ediris were shuttled between various IDCs, ending up in Nong Khai, a city on Thailand's northern border with Laos.

Thailand saw its options rapidly dwindling, a senior government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It couldn't protest to Myanmar's government to improve the lives of Rohingya and stem the exodus, the official said. That could ruffle diplomatic feathers and even jeopardize the access of Thai companies hoping to invest in Myanmar, one of the world's hottest frontier markets.

Nor could Thailand arrest, prosecute and jail the Rohingya for breaking Thai immigration law - there were simply too many of them. ""There would be no room in our prison cells,"" Police Maj-Gen Chatchawal said.

That growing problem gave birth to ""option two"" in October, a secret policy to deport the refugees back to Myanmar that led to Rohingyas being sold to human trafficking networks.

A hint of the policy shift came weeks earlier, on September 13, when Police Lt. Gen. Panu Kerdlarppol, chief of the Immigration Bureau, met with officials from other agencies on the resort island of Koh Samui to decide what to do with the Rohingya. Afterwards, Kerdlarppol announced that immigration authorities would take statements from the Rohingya ""to arrange their deportation"" and see if any want to go home. Arrangements would be made for those who did.

By early October, 2,058 Rohingya were held in 14 IDCs across Thailand, according to the Internal Security Operations Command, a national security agency run by the Thai military. A month later, that number stood at about 600, according to non-governmental organizations and Muslim aid workers. By the first week of December, it was 154, Thailand's immigration department said.

Rohingya were fast disappearing from Thailand's IDCs, and nobody knew where they were going.

""WE NOW BELONGED TO THEM""
Central to the policy was Ranong, a sparsely populated Thai province whose geography has always made it a smugglers' paradise. Ranong shares a long, ill-policed land and sea border with Myanmar. Its coastline is blanketed in dense mangrove forest and dotted with small, often uninhabited islands.

The provincial capital, also called Ranong, was built on tin mining but now lives off fishing and tourism. Rust-streaked trawlers from Thailand and Burma ply the same waters as dive boats and yachts. So do wooden ""long-tail"" boats, named after their extended drive-shafts, which ferry Burmese migrant workers to the Myanmar port of Kawthaung, only a 30-minute voyage away.

By late October, hundreds of Rohingya were being packed onto immigration trucks and driven to Ranong for processing and deportation. Among them were Ismail and Ediris, who arrived in the port city after a grueling, standing room-only journey of 1,200 km (746 miles) from Nong Khai.

At Ranong's IDC, they were photographed and told by Thai immigration officers they were being sent back to Myanmar. ""They said no other countries were accepting Rohingya, and Myanmar had become peaceful,"" said Ismail.

Then they were driven to a Ranong pier and herded onto four long-tail boats, each with a three-man crew of Thais and Burmese. Once at sea, the Rohingya asked the boat driver to help them. The Burmese-speaking driver shook his head and told the Rohingya they had been sold by Thai immigration officials for 11,000 baht ($350) each.

""They told us we now belonged to them,"" said Ismail.

After about 30 minutes at sea, the boats stopped. It was early afternoon on October 23. The vessels waited until about 6 p.m., when a large fishing boat arrived. They were loaded aboard and sailed through the night until they reached a jungle island, separated from the mainland by a narrow river. It was about 4 a.m.

Ismail said he saw about 200 other Rohingya in that camp, mostly sleeping and guarded by men with guns. The guards shoved Ismail and the others into a muddy clearing. There was no water or food. He was told he must pay 60,000 Thai baht ($1,850). Did he have family who could send the money? If he did, he could go wherever he wanted, Ismail said he was told. ""If you don't, we'll use this,"" one guard said, showing an iron rod.

Ismail had some cash but not enough. ""We need to escape,"" he whispered to Ediris. After an hour at the camp, just before dawn, the two men made their move. A guard fired shots in the air as they ran through the jungle and waded through a river to reach the mainland. For the next 24 hours, they survived by drinking stream-water and eating the bark of banana trees. They emerged onto a rubber plantation, their feet lacerated from the bare-foot jungle trek, and met a Burmese man who promised to spirit them into Malaysia for 8,000 baht, or $250, each.

They agreed and were driven to a house in southern Thailand, where Reuters interviewed them hours before they were smuggled by pick-up across the Malaysian border.

THE JUNGLE CAMPS
Bozor Mohamed, the third young Rohingya from Buthedaung, said he was held for 10 days at a jungle camp in Padang Besar.

He, too, said he had been delivered by Thai officials to trafficking boats along the maritime border with Myanmar. Afterwards, in torrential rain and under cover of darkness, along with perhaps 200 other Rohingya, Mohamed said he was ferried back across the strait to Thailand, where a new ordeal began.

The men were taken on a two-day journey by van, motor-bike, and foot to a smuggler's camp on the border with Malaysia. On the final hike, men with canes beat the young Rohingya and the others, many of them hobbled by months of detention. They stumbled and dragged themselves up steep forested hills.

Making the same trek was Mohamed Hassan, a fourth Rohingya to escape Thailand's trafficking network. Hassan is a baby-faced 19-year-old from the Rakhine capital of Sittwe.

He said he arrived at the camp in September after an overnight journey in a pick-up truck, followed by a two-hour walk into the hills with dozens of other Rohingya. Their captors ordered them to carry supplies, he said. Already giddy with fatigue and hunger after eight days at sea, the 19-year-old shouldered a sack of rice. ""If we stopped, the men beat us with sticks,"" he said.

The camp was partially skirted by a barbed-wire fence, he said, and guarded by about 25 men with guns, knives and clubs. Hassan reckoned it held about 300 Rohingya. They slept on plastic sheets, unprotected from the sun and rain, and were allowed only one meal a day, of rice and dried fish. He said he was constantly hungry.

One night, two Rohingya men tried to escape. The guards tracked them down, bound their hands and dragged them back to camp. Then, the guards beat the two men with clubs, rods and lengths of rubber. ""Everybody watched,"" said Hassan. ""We said nothing. Some people were crying.""

The beating lasted some 30 minutes, he said. Then a guard drew a small knife and slit the throat of one of the fugitives.

The prisoners were ordered to dispose of his corpse in the forest. The other victim was dumped in a stream. Afterwards, Hassan vomited with fear and exhaustion, but tried not to cry. ""When I cried they beat me. I had already decided that I would die there.""

His only hope of release was his older brother, 42, a long-time resident of Thailand. Hassan said he had his brother's telephone number with him, but at first his captors wouldn't let him call it. (Traffickers are reluctant to deal with relatives in Thailand, in case they have contacts with the Thai authorities that could jeopardize operations.)

Eventually, Hassan reached his brother, who said he sold his motorbike to help raise the equivalent of about $3,000 to secure Hassan's freedom, after 20 days in the camp.

Reporters were able to trace the location of three trafficking camps, based on the testimony of Rohingya who previously were held in them.

Three journalists traveled on motor-bikes and then hiked through rubber plantations and dense jungle to directly confirm the existence of a major camp near Baan Klong Tor.

Concealed by a blue tarpaulin tent, the Rohingya were split into groups of men and women. Some prayed. The encampment was patrolled by armed guards and protected by villagers and police. The reporters didn't attempt to enter. Villagers who have visited the camp said the number of people held inside ranged from an estimated 500 to a thousand or more, depending on the number of people arriving, departing or escaping.

Interviews with about a dozen villagers also confirmed two other large camps: one less than a mile away, and another in Padang Besar, near the Malaysia border.

""THAT RED LINE IN THE SEA""
Major General Chatchawal of the Royal Thai Police in Bangkok admitted there was an unofficial policy to deport the Rohingya to Myanmar. He called this ""a natural way or option two."" But he said the Rohingya went voluntarily.

""Some Rohingya in our IDCs can't stand being in limbo, so they ask to return to where they came from,"" said Chatchawal. ""This means going back to Myanmar."" Rohingya at the IDCs, for instance, sign statements in the presence of a local Islamic leader, in which they agree they want to return to Myanmar.

These statements, however, were at times produced in the absence of a Rohingya language translator. When reporters visited the Sadao IDC for this story, the translator was a Muslim from Myanmar who spoke only Thai and Burmese, and thus unable to explain what the detainees were signing.

Chatchawal was also presented with recent testimony from Rohingya who said they weren't taken to back to Myanmar. Instead, they were put in boats by Thai immigration officials, told they had been sold and taken under duress to Thailand's camps. Reporters interviewed four Rohingya for this story who said they fell prey to trafficking with official complicity.

At the house where Ediris and Ismail were interviewed were two other survivors of the trafficking camps: Abdul Basser, 24, and Fir Mohamed, 28. They told similar stories. Both were arrested after arriving in Thailand on January 25, and held at the overcrowded Phang Nga IDC for about eight months. On October 17, the two men, along with dozens of other Rohingya, were driven overnight to Ranong.

""We were told we could go back to Myanmar,"" said Mohamed.

That day, 48 Rohingya and five Buddhist Burmese were loaded into trucks and driven to a pier. The five Burmese were put on one boat; the Rohingya were put on another. After about a half hour at sea, the captain cut the engine. ""We thought the engine had stalled or broke down,"" said Basser. ""The captain told us we could not go back to Myanmar, that we had been sold by the immigration and police,"" he added.

Mohamed and Basser, too, escaped after being brought to an island near mainland Thailand.

Until now, the Thai government has denied official complicity in the smuggling or trafficking of Rohingya. But in a break with that position, Chatchawal said Thai officials might have received money previously in exchange for Rohingya, but not anymore. ""In the past, and I stress in the past, there may have been cases of officials taking payments for handing over migrants to boats,"" he said. ""I am not ruling it out, but I don't know of any specific cases recently.""

He said it was possible the Rohingya were intercepted by brokers and never made it to Myanmar. ""Once they've crossed that border, that red line in the sea, they are Myanmar's responsibility,"" he said.

He also admitted the camps uncovered by Reuters exist in breach of Thai laws. He referred to them as ""temporary shelters"" for a people who ultimately want to reach Malaysia. The smugglers who run the camps ""extort money from Rohingya"" but police don't accept bribes from them, he said.

As for the trafficking way stations in Padang Besar and Sadao, Chatchawal said: ""I do believe there could be more camps like these. They could be hidden deep in the jungle."""
191,Reuters,Szep,2014,Myanmar Rohingya,"The U.S. State Department is gathering information for its next Trafficking In Persons (TIP) Report, due to be published in June. It ranks countries on their efforts to combat human trafficking. Thailand faces an automatic downgrade to Tier 3, the lowest rank, unless it makes ""significant efforts"" to improve its record, the State Department says.

In an interview with Reuters, Police Maj-Gen Chatchawal Suksomjit of the Royal Thai Police defended Thailand's record for investigating and prosecuting traffickers and the Thai officials who help them.

Nine people have been arrested in Thailand in relation to Rohingya-smuggling so far in 2013, including two government officials, according to data provided by Chatchawal's office. None of the arrests have led to convictions, however, and charges against one of the two officials were dropped.

The numbers suggest the enforcement is losing steam. Thailand prosecuted 27 people for trafficking in 2012, down from 67 the previous year, according to the 2013 TIP Report. Only 10 of those prosecutions - one of them an official - resulted in convictions, the report said.

Corruption among Thai law enforcement personnel allowed human trafficking to prosper, said the State Department. Thai police and immigration officials ""extorted money or sex"" from detainees or ""sold Burmese migrants unable to pay labor brokers or sex traffickers,"" the 2013 report said.

The same report urged the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), Thailand's answer to the FBI, to ""increase efforts . . . to investigate, prosecute, and convict officials engaged in trafficking-related corruption.""

When Reuters described what it learned about Rohingya trafficking to DSI chief Tarit Pengdith, he said it was the responsibility of the Thai police and military to investigate.

""The DSI has heard about cases of Rohingya being moved from immigration detention centers across Thailand to other parts of the country where they are sold to human traffickers, but we are not responsible for investigating these cases,"" Tarit said.

Ultimately, the stateless Rohingya are not the police's responsibility either, Police Maj-Gen Chatchawal said: ""The Rohingya are Myanmar's problem because they don't want to stay in Myanmar. They are persecuted there.""

Myanmar, meanwhile, disowns them, recently rejecting a U.N. resolution urging citizenship for the Rohingya. Myanmar government spokesman Ye Htut referred to a 1982 citizenship law that effectively renders the Rohingya stateless.

""Citizenship will not be granted to those who are not entitled to it under the law no matter who applies pressure on us,"" he said."
192,Reuters,Szep,2014,Myanmar Rohingya," A 16-year-old Muslim boy lay dying on a thin metal table. Bitten by a rabid dog a month ago, he convulsed and drooled as his parents wedged a stick between his teeth to stop him from biting off his tongue.

Swift treatment might have saved Waadulae. But there are no doctors, painkillers or vaccines in this primitive hospital near Sittwe, capital of Rakhine State in western Myanmar. It is a lonely medical outpost that serves about 85,300 displaced people, almost all of them Muslims who lost their homes in fighting with Buddhist mobs last year.

""All we can give him is sedatives,"" said Maung Maung Hla, a former health ministry official who, despite lacking a medical degree, treats about 150 patients a day. The two doctors who once worked there haven't been seen in a month. Medical supplies stopped when they left, said Maung Maung Hla, a Muslim.

These trash-strewn camps represent the dark side of Myanmar's celebrated transition to democracy: apartheid-like policies segregating minority Muslims from the Buddhist majority. As communal violence spreads, nowhere are these practices more brutally enforced than around Sittwe.

In an echo of what happened in the Balkans after the fall of communist Yugoslavia, the loosening of authoritarian control in Myanmar is giving freer rein to ethnic hatred.

President Thein Sein, a former general, said in a May 6 televised speech his government was committed to creating ""a peaceful and harmonious society in Rakhine State.""

But the sand dunes and barren paddy fields outside Sittwe hold a different story. Here, emergency shelters set up for Rohingya Muslims last year have become permanent, prison-like ghettos. Muslims are stopped from leaving at gunpoint. Aid workers are threatened. Camps seethe with anger and disease.

In central Sittwe, ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and local officials exult in what they regard as a hard-won triumph: streets almost devoid of Muslims. Before last year's violence, the city's Muslims numbered about 73,000, nearly half its population. Today, there are fewer than 5,000 left.

Myanmar's transformation from global pariah to budding democracy once seemed remarkably smooth. After nearly half a century of military dictatorship, the quasi-civilian government that took power in March 2011 astonished the world by releasing dissidents, relaxing censorship and re-engaging with the West.

Then came the worst sectarian violence for decades. Clashes between Rakhine Buddhists and stateless Rohingya Muslims in June and October 2012 killed at least 192 people and displaced 140,000. Most of the dead and homeless were Muslims.

""Rakhine State is going through a profound crisis"" that ""has the potential to undermine the entire reform process,"" said Tomás Ojea Quintana, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar.

Life here, he said, resembles junta-era Myanmar, with rampant human-rights abuses and a pervasive security apparatus. ""What is happening in Rakhine State is following the pattern of what has happened in Myanmar during the military government,"" he said in an interview.

The crisis poses the biggest domestic challenge yet for the reformist leaders of one of Asia's most ethnically diverse countries. Muslims make up about 5 percent of its 60 million people. Minorities, such as the Kachin and the Shan, are watching closely after enduring persecution under the former junta.

As the first powerful storm of the monsoon season approached western Myanmar this week, the government and U.N. agencies began a chaotic evacuation from the camps, urging thousands of Rohingya Muslims to move to safer areas on higher ground across Rakhine State.

Some resisted, fearing they would lose all they had left: their tarpaulin tents and makeshift huts. More than 50 are believed to have drowned in a botched evacuation by sea.

""THEY ALL TELL LIES""
Sittwe's last remaining Muslim-dominated quarter, Aung Mingalar, is locked down by police and soldiers who patrol all streets leading in and out. Muslims can't leave without written permission from Buddhist local authorities, which Muslims say is almost impossible to secure.

Metal barricades, topped with razor wire, are opened only for Buddhist Rakhines. Despite a ban against foreign journalists, Reuters was able to enter Aung Mingalar. Near-deserted streets were flanked by shuttered shops. Some Muslims peered from doors or windows.

On the other side of the barricades, Rakhine Buddhists revel in the segregation.

""I don't trust them. They are not honest,"" said Khin Mya, 63, who owns a general store on Sittwe's main street. ""Muslims are hot-headed; they like to fight, either with us or among themselves.""

Ei Mon Kyaw, 19, who sells betel nut and chewing tobacco, said Muslims are ""really dirty. It is better we live apart.""

State spokesman Win Myaing, a Buddhist, explained why Aung Mingalar's besieged Muslims were forbidden from speaking to the media. ""It's because they all tell lies,"" he said. He also denied the government had engaged in ethnic cleansing, a charge leveled most recently by Human Rights Watch in an April 22 report.

""How can it be ethnic cleansing? They are not an ethnic group,"" he said from an office on Sittwe's main street, overlooking an empty mosque guarded by soldiers and police.

His comments reflect a historic dispute over the origins of the country's estimated 800,000 Rohingya Muslims, who claim a centuries-old lineage in Rakhine State.

The government says they are Muslim migrants from northern neighbor Bangladesh who arrived during British rule from 1824. After independence in 1948, Myanmar's new rulers tried to limit citizenship to those whose roots in the country predated British rule. A 1982 Citizenship Act excluded Rohingya from the country's 135 recognized ethnic groups, denying them citizenship and rendering them stateless. Bangladesh also disowns them and has refused to grant them refugee status since 1992.

The United Nations calls them ""virtually friendless"" and among the world's most persecuted people.

BOAT PEOPLE EXODUS
The state government has shelved any plan to return the Rohingya Muslims to their villages on a technicality: for defying a state requirement that they identify themselves as ""Bengali,"" a term that suggests they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

All these factors are accelerating an exodus of Rohingya boat people emigrating in rickety fishing vessels to other Southeast Asian countries.

From October to March, between the monsoons, about 25,000 Rohingya left Myanmar on boats, according to new data from Arakan Project, a Rohingya advocacy group. That was double the previous year, turning a Rakhine problem into a region-wide one.

The cost of the one-way ticket is steep for an impoverished people - usually about 200,000 kyat, or $220, often paid for by remittances from family members who have already left.

Many who survive the perilous journeys wind up in majority-Muslim Malaysia. Some end up in U.N. camps, where they are denied permanent asylum. Others find illegal work on construction sites or other subsistence jobs. Tens of thousands are held in camps in Thailand. Growing numbers have been detained in Indonesia.

MOB VIOLENCE
Rakhine State, one of the poorest regions of Southeast Asia's poorest country, had high hopes for the reform era.

In Sittwe's harbor, India is funding a $214 million port, river and road network that will carve a trade route into India's landlocked northeast. From Kyaukphyu, a city 65 miles southeast of Sittwe, gas and oil pipelines stretch to China's energy-hungry northwest. Both projects capitalize on Myanmar's growing importance at Asia's crossroads.

That promise has been interrupted by communal tensions that flared into the open after the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by Muslim men in May last year. Six days later, in retribution, a Buddhist mob beat 10 Muslims to death. Violence then swept Maungdaw, one of the three Rohingya-majority districts bordering Bangladesh, on June 8. Rohingya mobs destroyed homes and killed an unknown number of Rakhines.

The clashes spread to Sittwe. More than 2,500 homes and buildings went up in flames, as Rohingya and Rakhine mobs rampaged. When the smoke cleared, both suffered losses, though the official death toll for Rohingya - 57 - was nearly double that for Buddhist Rakhines. Entire Muslim districts were razed.

October saw more violence. This time, Buddhist mobs attacked Muslim villages across the state over five days, led in some cases by Rakhine nationalists tied to a powerful political party, incited by Buddhist monks and abetted at times by local security forces.

U.S. President Barack Obama, on a groundbreaking visit in November, urged reconciliation. ""The Rohingya ... hold within themselves the same dignity as you do, and I do,"" he said. The week he visited, Thein Sein vowed to forge ethnic unity in a letter to the United Nations.

But the violence kept spreading. Anti-Muslim unrest, whipped up by Buddhist monks, killed at least 44 people in the central city of Meikhtila in March. In April and May, Buddhist mobs destroyed mosques and hundreds of Muslim homes just a few hours' drive from Yangon, the country's largest city.

Thein Sein responded by sending troops to volatile areas and setting up an independent commission into the Rakhine violence. Its recommendations, released April 27, urged meetings of Muslim and Buddhist leaders to foster tolerance, Muslims to be moved to safer ground ahead of the storm season, and the continued segregation of the two communities ""until the overt emotions subside.""

It sent a strong message, calling the Rohingya ""Bengalis,"" a term that suggests they belong in Bangladesh, and backing the 1982 citizenship law that rendered stateless even those Rohingya who had lived in Myanmar for generations.

The Rohingya's rapid population growth had fueled the clashes with Buddhists, it said, recommending voluntary family-planning education programs for them. It suggested doubling the number of soldiers and police in the region.

Rohingya responded angrily. ""We completely reject this report,"" said Fukan Ahmed, 54, a Rohingya elder who lost his home in Sittwe.

Local government officials, however, were already moving to impose policies in line with the report.

THE HATED LIST
On the morning of April 26, a group of state officials entered the Theak Kae Pyin refugee camp. With them were three policemen and several Border Administration Force officers, known as the Nasaka, a word derived from the initials of its Burmese name. Unique to the region, the Nasaka consists of officers from the police, military, customs and immigration. They control every aspect of Rohingya life, and are much feared.

Documented human-rights abuses blamed on the Nasaka include rape, forced labor and extortion. Rohingya cannot travel or marry without the Nasaka's permission, which is never secured without paying bribes, activists allege.

State spokesman Win Myaing said the Nasaka's mission was to compile a list identifying where people had lived before the violence, a precondition for resettlement. They wanted to know who was from Sittwe and who was from more remote townships such as Pauktaw and Kyaukphyu, areas that saw a near-total expulsion of Muslims in October.

Many fled for what Win Myaing said were unregistered camps outside Sittwe, often in flood-prone areas. ""We would like to move them back to where they came from in the next two months,"" said Win Myaing. The list was the first step towards doing that.

The list, however, also required Muslims to identify themselves as Bengali. For Fukan Ahmed and other Rohingya leaders, it sent a chilling message: If they want to be resettled, they must deny their identity.

Agitated crowds gathered as the officials tried to compile the list, witnesses said. Women and children chanted ""Rohingya! Rohingya!"" As the police officers were leaving, one tumbled to the ground, struck by a stone to his head, according to Win Myaing. Rohingya witnesses said the officer tripped. Seven Rohingya were arrested and charged with causing grievous hurt to a public servant, criminal intimidation and rioting.

Compiling the list is on hold, said Win Myaing. So, too, is resettlement.

""If they trust us, then (resettlement) can happen immediately. If you won't even accept us making a list, then how can we try and do other things?"" he asked. The crisis could be defused if Rohingya accepted the 1982 Citizenship Law, he said.

But doing so would effectively confirm their statelessness. Official discrimination and lack of documentation meant many Rohingya have no hope of fulfilling the requirements.

Boshi Raman, 40, said he and other Rohingya would never sign a document calling themselves Bengali. ""We would rather die,"" he said.

Win Myaing blamed the Rohingya for their misfortune. ""If you look back at the events that occurred, it wasn't because the Rakhines were extreme. The problems were all started by them,"" the Muslims, he said.

SCORCHED EARTH
In Theak Kae Pyin camp, a sea of tarpaulin tents and fragile huts built of straw from the last rice harvest, there is an air of growing permanence. More than 11,000 live in this camp alone, according to U.N. data. Naked children bathe in a murky-brown pond and play on sewage-lined pathways.

A year ago, before the unrest, Haleda Somisian lived in Narzi, a Sittwe district of more than 10,000 people. Today, it is rubble and scorched earth. Somisian, 20, wants to return and rebuild. Her husband, she says, has started to beat her. In Narzi, he worked. Now he is jobless, restless and despondent.

""I want to leave this place,"" she said.

Some of those confined to the camps are Kaman Muslims, who are recognized as one of Myanmar's 135 official ethnic groups; they usually hold citizenship and can be hard to tell apart from Rakhine Buddhists. They fled after October's violence when their homes were destroyed by Rakhine mobs in remote townships such as Kyaukphyu. They, too, are prevented from leaving.

Beyond Sittwe, another 50,000 people, mostly Rohingya, live in similar camps in other parts of the state destroyed in last year's sectarian violence.

Across the state, the U.N relief agency has provided about 4,000 tents and built about 300 bamboo homes, each of which can hold eight families. Another 500 bamboo homes are planned by year-end. None are designed to be permanent, said agency spokeswoman Vivian Tan. Tents can last six months to a year; bamboo homes about two years.

The agency wants to provide the temporary shelter that is badly needed. ""But we don't want in any way to create permanent shelters and to condone any kind of segregation,"" Tan said.

Aid group Doctors Without Borders has accused hardline nationalists of threatening its staff, impairing its ability to deliver care. Mobile clinics have appeared in some camps, but a U.N. report describes most as ""insufficient.""

Waadulae, suffering from rabies, was treated at Dar Paing hospital, whose lone worker, Maung Maung Hla, was overwhelmed. ""We have run out of antibiotics,"" he said. ""There is no malaria medicine. There's no medicine for tuberculosis or diabetes. No vaccines. There's no equipment to check peoples' condition. There are no drips for people suffering from acute diarrhea.""

State spokesman Win Myaing said Rakhine doctors feared entering the camps. ""It's reached a stage where they say they'd quit their jobs before they would go to these places,"" he said.

The treatment of the Rohingya contrasts with that of some 4,080 displaced ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in central Sittwe. They can leave their camps freely, work in the city, move in with relatives in nearby villages and rebuild, helped by an outpouring of aid from Burmese business leaders.

Hset Hlaing, 33, who survives on handouts from aid agencies at Thae Chaung camp, recalls how he earned 10,000 kyat ($11 a day) from a general-goods stall in Sittwe before his business and home went up in flames last June. Like other Muslims, he refuses to accept the term Bengali.

""I don't want to go to another country. I was born here,"" he says, sipping tea in a bamboo shack. ""But if the government won't accept us, we will leave. We'll go by boat. We'll go to a country that can accept us."""
193,Reuters,Szep,2014,Myanmar Rohingya,"The Buddhist extremist movement in Myanmar, known as 969, portrays itself as a grassroots creed.

Its chief proponent, a monk named Wirathu, was once jailed by the former military junta for anti-Muslim violence and once called himself the ""Burmese bin Laden.""

But a Reuters examination traces 969's origins to an official in the dictatorship that once ran Myanmar, and which is the direct predecessor of today's reformist government. The 969 movement now enjoys support from senior government officials, establishment monks and even some members of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), the political party of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Wirathu urges Buddhists to boycott Muslim shops and shun interfaith marriages. He calls mosques ""enemy bases.""

Among his admirers: Myanmar's minister of religious affairs.

""Wirathu's sermons are about promoting love and understanding between religions,"" Sann Sint, minister of religious affairs, told Reuters in his first interview with the international media. ""It is impossible he is inciting religious violence.""

Sann Sint, a former lieutenant general in Myanmar's army, also sees nothing wrong with the boycott of Muslim businesses being led by the 969 monks. ""We are now practicing market economics,"" he said. ""Nobody can stop that. It is up to the consumers.""

President Thein Sein is signaling a benign view of 969, too. His office declined to comment for this story. But in response to growing controversy over the movement, it issued a statement Sunday, saying 969 ""is just a symbol of peace"" and Wirathu is ""a son of Lord Buddha.""

Wirathu and other monks have been closely linked to the sectarian violence spreading across Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Anti-Muslim unrest simmered under the junta that ran the country for nearly half a century. But the worst fighting has occurred since the quasi-civilian government took power in March 2011.

Two outbursts in Rakhine State last year killed at least 192 people and left 140,000 homeless, mostly stateless Rohingya Muslims. A Reuters investigation found that organized attacks on Muslims last October were led by Rakhine nationalists incited by Buddhist monks and sometimes abetted by local security forces.

In March this year, at least 44 people died and 13,000 were displaced - again, mostly Muslims - during riots in Meikhtila, a city in central Myanmar. Reuters documented in April that the killings happened after monks led Buddhist mobs on a rampage. In May, Buddhists mobs burned and terrorized Muslim neighborhoods in the northern city of Lashio. Reports of unrest have since spread nationwide.

The numbers 969, innocuous in themselves, refer to attributes of the Buddha, his teachings and the monkhood. But 969 monks have been providing the moral justification for a wave of anti-Muslim bloodshed that could scuttle Myanmar's nascent reform program. Another prominent 969 monk, Wimala Biwuntha, likens Muslims to a tiger who enters an ill-defended house to snatch away its occupants.

""Without discipline, we'll lose our religion and our race,"" he said in a recent sermon. ""We might even lose our country.""

Officially, Myanmar has no state religion, but its rulers have long put Buddhism first. Muslims make up an estimated 4 percent of the populace. Buddhism is followed by 90 percent of the country's 60 million people and is promoted by a special department within the ministry of religion created during the junta.

EASY SCAPEGOATS
Monks play a complex part in Burmese politics. They took a central role in pro-democracy ""Saffron Revolution"" uprisings against military rule in 2007. The generals - who included current President Thein Sein and most senior members of his government - suppressed them. Now, Thein Sein's ambitious program of reforms has ushered in new freedoms of speech and assembly, liberating the country's roughly 500,000 monks. They can travel at will to spread Buddhist teachings, including 969 doctrine.

In Burma's nascent democracy, the monks have emerged as a political force in the run-up to a general election scheduled for 2015. Their new potency has given rise to a conspiracy theory here: The 969 movement is controlled by disgruntled hardliners from the previous junta, who are fomenting unrest to derail the reforms and foil an election landslide by Suu Kyi's NLD.

No evidence has emerged to support this belief. But some in the government say there is possibly truth to it.

""Some people are very eager to reform, some people don't want to reform,"" Soe Thein, one of President Thein Sein's two closest advisors, told Reuters. ""So, regarding the sectarian violence, some people may be that side - the anti-reform side.""

Even if 969 isn't controlled by powerful hardliners, it has broad support, both in high places and at the grass roots, where it is a genuine and growing movement.

Officials offer tacit backing, said Wimala, the 969 monk. ""By letting us give speeches to protect our religion and race, I assume they are supporting us,"" he said.

The Yangon representative of the Burmese Muslim Association agreed. ""The anti-Muslim movement is growing and the government isn't stopping it,"" said Myo Win, a Muslim teacher. Myo Win likened 969 to the Ku Klux Klan.

The religion minister, Sann Sint, said the movement doesn't have official state backing. But he defended Wirathu and other monks espousing the creed.

""I don't think they are preaching to make problems,"" he said.

Local authorities, too, have lent the movement some backing.

Its logo - now one of Myanmar's most recognizable - bears the Burmese numerals 969, a chakra wheel and four Asiatic lions representing the ancient Buddhist emperor Ashoka. Stickers with the logo are handed out free at speeches. They adorn shops, homes, taxis and souvenir stalls at the nation's most revered Buddhist pagoda, the Shwedagon. They are a common sight in areas plagued by unrest.

Some authorities treat the symbol with reverence. A court in Bago, a region near Yangon hit by anti-Muslim violence this year, jailed a Muslim man for two years in April after he removed a 969 sticker from a betel-nut shop. He was sentenced under a section of Burma's colonial-era Penal Code, which outlaws ""deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings"".

QUASI-OFFICIAL ORIGINS
The 969 movement's ties to the state date back to the creed's origins. Wimala, Wirathu and other 969 preachers credit its creation to the late Kyaw Lwin, an ex-monk, government official and prolific writer, now largely forgotten outside religious circles.

Myanmar's former dictators handpicked Kyaw Lwin to promote Buddhism after the brutal suppression of the 1988 democracy uprising. Thousands were killed or injured after soldiers opened fire on unarmed protesters, including monks. Later, to signal their disgust, monks refused to accept alms from military families for three months, a potent gesture in devoutly Buddhist Myanmar.

Afterwards, the military set about co-opting Buddhism in an effort to tame rebellious monks and repair its image. Monks were registered and their movements restricted. State-run media ran almost daily reports of generals overseeing temple renovations or donating alms to abbots.

In 1991, the junta created a Department for the Promotion and Propagation of the Sasana (DPPS), a unit within the Religion Ministry, and appointed Kyaw Lwin as its head. Sasana means ""religion"" in Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism; in Burma, the word is synonymous with Buddhism itself.

The following year, the DPPS published ""How To Live As A Good Buddhist,"" a distillation of Kyaw Lwin's writings. It was republished in 2000 as ""The Best Buddhist,"" its cover bearing an early version of the 969 logo.

Kyaw Lwin stepped down in 1992. The current head is Khine Aung, a former military officer.

Kyaw Lwin's widow and son still live in his modest home in central Yangon. Its living room walls are lined with shelves of Kyaw Lwin's books and framed photos of him as a monk and meditation master.

Another photo shows Kyaw Lwin sharing a joke with Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, then chief of military intelligence and one of Myanmar's most feared men. Kyaw Lwin enjoyed close relations with other junta leaders, said his son, Aung Lwin Tun, 38, a car importer. He was personally instructed to write ""The Best Buddhist"" by the late Saw Maung, then Myanmar's senior-most general. He met ""often"" to discuss religion with ex-dictator Than Shwe, who retired in March 2011 and has been out of the public eye since then.

""The Best Buddhist"" is out of print, but Aung Lwin Tun plans to republish it. ""Many people are asking for it now,"" he said. He supports today's 969 movement, including its anti-Muslim boycott. ""It's like building a fence to protect our religion,"" he said.

Also supporting 969 is Kyaw Lwin's widow, 65, whose name was withheld at the family's request. She claimed that Buddhists who marry Muslims are forced at their weddings to tread on an image of Buddha, and that the ritual slaughter of animals by Shi'ite Muslims makes it easier for them to kill humans.

Among the monks Kyaw Lwin met during his time as DPPS chief was Wiseitta Biwuntha, who hailed from the town of Kyaukse, near the northern cultural capital of Mandalay. Better known as Wirathu, he is today one of the 969's most incendiary leaders.

Wirathu and Kyaw Lwin stayed in touch after their 1992 meeting, said Aung Lwin Tun, who believed his father would admire Wirathu's teachings. ""He is doing what other people won't - protecting and promoting the religion.""

Kyaw Lwin died in 2001, aged 70. That same year, Wirathu began preaching about 969, and the U.S. State Department reported ""a sharp increase in anti-Muslim violence"" in Myanmar. Anti-Muslim sentiment was stoked in March 2001 by the Taliban's destruction of Buddhist statues in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and in September by al Qaeda's attacks in the United States.

Two years later, Wirathu was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in jail for distributing anti-Muslim pamphlets that incited communal riots in his hometown. At least 10 Muslims were killed by a Buddhist mob, according to a State Department report. The 969 movement had spilled its first blood.

969 VERSUS 786
Wirathu was freed in 2011 during an amnesty for political prisoners. While the self-styled ""Burmese bin Laden"" has become the militant face of 969, the movement derives evangelical energy from monks in Mon, a coastal state where people pride themselves on being Myanmar's first Buddhists. Since last year's violence they have organized a network across the nation. They led a boycott last year of a Muslim-owned bus company in Moulmein, Mon's capital. Extending that boycott nationwide has become a central 969 goal.

Muslims held many senior government positions after Myanmar gained independence from Britain in 1948. That changed in 1962, when the military seized power and stymied the hiring and promoting of Muslim officials. The military drew on popular prejudices that Muslims dominated business and used their profits to build mosques, buy Buddhist wives and spread Islamic teachings.

All this justified the current boycott of Muslim businesses, said Zarni Win Tun, a 31-year-old lawyer and 969 devotee, who said Muslims had long shunned Buddhist businesses. ""We didn't start the boycott - they did,"" she said. ""We're just using their methods.""

By that she means the number 786, which Muslims of South Asian origin often display on their homes and businesses. It is a numerical representation of the Islamic blessing, ""In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate and Merciful"". But Buddhists in Myanmar - a country obsessed by numerology - claim the sum of the three numbers signifies a Muslim plan for world domination in the 21st century.

It is possible to understand why some Buddhists might believe this. Religious and dietary customs prohibit Muslims from frequenting Buddhist restaurants, for example. Muslims also dominate some small- and medium-sized business sectors. The names of Muslim-owned construction companies - Naing Group, Motherland, Fatherland - are winning extra prominence now that Yangon is experiencing a reform-era building boom.

However, the biggest construction firms - those involved in multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects - are run by tycoons linked to members of the former dictatorship. They are Buddhists.

Buddhist clients have canceled contracts with Muslim-owned construction companies in northern Yangon, fearing attacks by 969 followers on the finished buildings, said Shwe Muang, a Muslim MP with the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party. ""I worry that if this starts in one township it will infect others,"" he said.

""OUR LIVES ARE NOT SAFE""
For Zarni Win Tun, the 969 devotee, shunning Muslims is a means of ensuring sectarian peace. She points to the Meikhtila violence, which was sparked by an argument between Buddhist customers and a Muslim gold-shop owner. ""If they'd bought from their own people, the problem wouldn't have happened,"" she said.

Her conviction that segregation is the solution to sectarian strife is echoed in national policy. A total of at least 153,000 Muslims have been displaced in the past year after the violence in Rakhine and in central Myanmar. Most are concentrated in camps guarded by the security forces with little hope of returning to their old lives.

A few prominent monks have publicly criticized the 969 movement, and some Facebook users have launched a campaign to boycott taxis displaying its stickers. Some Yangon street stalls have started selling 969 CDs more discreetly since the Meikhtila bloodbath. The backlash has otherwise been muted.

Wimala, the Mon monk, shrugged off criticism from fellow monks. ""They shouldn't try to stop us from doing good things,"" he said.

In mid-June, he and Wirathu attended a hundreds-strong monastic convention near Yangon, where Wirathu presented a proposal to restrict Buddhist women from marrying Muslim men.

In another sign 969 is going mainstream, Wirathu's bid was supported by Dhammapiya, a U.S.-educated professor at the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary University in Yangon, a respected institution with links to other Buddhist universities in Asia.

Dhammapiya described 969 as a peaceful movement that is helping Myanmar through a potentially turbulent transition. ""The 969 issue for us is no issue,"" Dhammapiya told Reuters. ""Buddhists always long to live in peace and harmony.""

NO MOSQUES HERE
The only mass movement to rival 969 is the National League for Democracy. Their relationship is both antagonistic and complementary.

In a speech posted on YouTube in late March, Wirathu said the party and Suu Kyi's inner circle were dominated by Muslims. ""If you look at NLD offices in any town, you will see bearded people,"" he said. Followers of Wimala told Reuters they had removed photos of Suu Kyi - a devout Buddhist - from their homes to protest her apparent reluctance to speak up for Buddhists affected by last year's violence in Rakhine. Suu Kyi's reticence on sectarian violence has also angered Muslims.

The Burmese Muslim Association has accused NLD members of handing out 969 materials in Yangon.

Party spokesman Nyan Win said ""some NLD members"" were involved in the movement. ""But the NLD cannot interfere with the freedoms or rights of members,"" he said. ""They all have the right to do what they want in terms of social affairs.""

Min Thet Lin, 36, a taxi driver, is exercising that right. The front and back windows of his car are plastered with 969 stickers. He is also an NLD leader in Thaketa, a working-class Yangon township known for anti-Muslim sentiment.

In February, Buddhist residents of Thaketa descended upon an Islamic school in Min Thet Lin's neighborhood which they claimed was being secretly converted into a mosque. Riot police were deployed while the structure was demolished.

A month later, Wimala and two other Mon monks visited Thaketa to give Buddhists what a promotional leaflet called ""dhamma medicine"" - that is, three days of 969 sermons. ""Don't give up the fight,"" urged the leaflet.

Today, the property is sealed off and guarded by police. ""People don't want a mosque here,"" said Min Thet Lin.

As he spoke, 969's pop anthem, ""Song to Whip Up Religious Blood,"" rang over the rooftops. A nearby monastic school was playing the song for enrolling pupils."
194,Reuters,Szep,2014,Myanmar Rohingya,"Wimala Biwuntha is a pint-sized monk with boyish features who could barely see over the lectern during his recent sermon to a mesmerized crowd at a Yangon monastery. Yet his stature in Myanmar grows daily, thanks to his stark message to fellow Buddhists: ""We are digging our own graves.""

Wimala's sermon in the low-rent suburb of Insein was billed as an ""introduction to the Buddhist logo"". To warm up the crowd, a catchy pop tune called ""Song to Whip Up Religious Blood"" was played at high volume on a continuous loop on the monastery's loudspeakers. ""Buddhists should not stay calm anymore,"" ran the lyrics.

Wimala hails from Mon, a coastal state near Yangon. The Mon pride themselves on being Myanmar's earliest converts to Buddhism. In October, with violence raging in Rakhine, he and fellow Mon monks set up the ""Gana Wasaka Sangha"" network to propagate 969 teachings.

It distributes a map showing Myanmar surrounded by Muslim-majority countries where Buddhism once flourished, such as Indonesia. ""If necessary,"" runs its slogan, ""we will build a fence with our bones.""

Wimala arrived for his sermon barefoot, his shaven head shielded from the searing pre-monsoon sun by white umbrellas held aloft by disciples. His sermon was filmed by two cameramen, who later burned it onto DVDs that are distributed across Myanmar. Now that junta-era controls on the Internet have gone, 969 speeches are also widely disseminated on Facebook and YouTube.

Wimala's preaching style is by turns intimate and hectoring. He cracks jokes. Often, he closes his eyes and intones like a revivalist preacher. Unfurling a poster of the 969 logo, he led the audience through the first of many renditions of the movement's catechism.

""When you eat?"" he asked.

""Nine six nine!"" shouted his followers.

""When you go?""

""Nine six nine!""

""When you buy?""

""Nine six nine!""

""When you wake up?""

""Nine six nine!""

""When you sleep?

""Nine six nine!""

Afterwards, Wimala spoke approvingly of monks in Karen State who fine Buddhists caught buying from Muslims.

The Mon monks have delivered dozens of sermons in known sectarian trouble-spots. Wimala's speech in the Bago farming town of Minhla in February was followed by rising communal tensions, Muslim residents told Reuters. Four weeks later, a Buddhist mob destroyed mosques and Muslim houses in the town. Many of Minhla's 500 Muslims fled.

In an interview, Wimala said 969 might have inspired followers to commit anti-Muslim violence. But they were an ill-educated minority whose actions had been exaggerated by ""Muslim-owned media"", he said.

Emboldened, Wimala wants to reach a younger audience. He and other abbots are promoting compulsory religious education for Buddhist children.

The Mon monks plan to teach 60,000 children at more than 160 schools in Yangon and Moulmein, said Yin Yin Htwe, 34, a Wimala donor and disciple who runs a jewelry business. ""I want children to learn the dhamma (Buddhist teachings), improve their manners and protect the nation and religion,"" she said.

Outside, waiting to greet Wimala, are dozens of primary schoolchildren with 969 logos pinned to their shirts."
195,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa,"Eight youths, some armed with slingshots and machetes, stood warily alongside a rutted dirt road at an opening in the high reeds, the path to the village of Kolo Bengou. The deadly Ebola virus is believed to have infected several people in the village, and the youths were blocking the path to prevent health workers from entering.

“We don’t want any visitors,” said their leader, Faya Iroundouno, 17, president of Kolo Bengou’s youth league. “We don’t want any contact with anyone.” The others nodded in agreement and fiddled with their slingshots.

Singling out the international aid group Doctors Without Borders, Mr. Iroundouno continued, “Wherever those people have passed, the communities have been hit by illness.”

Health workers here say they are now battling two enemies: the unprecedented Ebola epidemic, which has killed more than 660 people in four countries since it was first detected in March, and fear, which has produced growing hostility toward outside help. On Friday alone, health authorities in Guinea confirmed 14 new cases of the disease.

Workers and officials, blamed by panicked populations for spreading the virus, have been threatened with knives, stones and machetes, their vehicles sometimes surrounded by hostile mobs. Log barriers across narrow dirt roads block medical teams from reaching villages where the virus is suspected. Sick and dead villagers, cut off from help, are infecting others.

“This is very unusual, that we are not trusted,” said Marc Poncin, the emergency coordinator in Guinea for Doctors Without Borders, the main group fighting the disease here. “We’re not stopping the epidemic.”

Efforts to monitor it are grinding to a halt because of “intimidation,” he said. People appear to have more confidence in witch doctors.

Health officials say the epidemic is out of control, moving back and forth across the porous borders of Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia — often on the backs of the cheap motorcycles that ply the roads of this region of green hills and dense forest — infiltrating the lively open-air markets, overwhelming weak health facilities and decimating villages.

It was in this rural area, 400 miles over bad roads from Guinea’s capital, Conakry, where the outbreak was first spotted, and where it has hit hardest. More than 80 percent of those infected have died in this region, and Guinea has recorded more than twice as many deaths as the other countries.

In Koundony, more than one-eighth of the population, including the headman, are dead; many others have fled.

There is no known cure for the virus, which causes raging fever, vomiting, diarrhea and uncontrolled bleeding in about half the cases and up to 90 percent of the time, rapid death. Merely touching an infected person, or the body of a victim, is dangerous; coming into contact with blood, vomit or feces can be deadly.

Now the fear of aid workers, principally from Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross, is helping to spread the disease, health officials say, creating a secondary crisis.

Villagers flee at the sight of a Red Cross truck. When a Westerner passes, villagers cry out, “Ebola, Ebola!” and run away.

This month, Doctors Without Borders classified 12 villages in Guinea as “red,” meaning they might harbor Ebola but were inaccessible for safety reasons.

As recently as April, the epidemic seemed to be under control. But in the past two weeks, its center appeared to have shifted across the border to Sierra Leone, where most of the new dead were being recorded. The sick are being hidden and the dead buried, without any protection.

Last week, the Sierra Leone Health Ministry reported that its lead doctor fighting Ebola had contracted the disease, and the virus had spread to a fourth country, with a confirmed fatality in Nigeria. Over the weekend, an aid organization working in Liberia, Samaritan’s Purse, said that two Americans, a doctor who was treating Ebola patients and an aid worker on a case management team, had tested positive for the virus. And the Liberian government said Sunday that one of its most high-profile doctors had died of Ebola, according to The Associated Press.

Back in Guinea, in the village of Wabengou, residents placed a tree in the road to block outsiders. They also attacked an official delegation from Conakry, rushing its cars, banging on the vehicles and brandishing machetes, according to Doctors Without Borders.

“We don’t want them in there at all,” said Wabengou’s chief, Marcel Dambadounou. “We don’t accept their presence at all. They are the transporters of the virus in these communities.”

“We are absolutely afraid, and that’s why we are avoiding contact with everybody,” he said, “the whole world.”

Doctors Without Borders has set up an emergency treatment center in the regional capital, Guéckédou, but a nurse there said the center had diminishing appeal.

“Here, if the people come in, they don’t leave alive,” said the nurse, Fadima Diawara.

It may not help win confidence that the medical teams wear top-to-toe suits and masks, burning much of the outfit after helping a patient.

The wariness against outside intervention has deep roots. This part of Guinea, known as the Forest Region, where more than 200 people have already died of the disease, is known for its strong belief in traditional religion. The dictator who ruled Guinea with an iron fist for decades, Ahmed Sékou Touré, was only partly successful in a 1960s campaign to stamp out these beliefs, despite mass burnings of fetishes.

Addressing villagers this month in Bawa, where a woman had just died, the regional prefect from Guéckédou, Mohammed Cinq Keita, warned: “There is no root, no leaf, no animal that can cure you. Don’t be fooled.”

Near the border with Sierra Leone this month, Doctors Without Borders discovered an Ebola patient who had been privately “treated” in the village of Teldou and then returned to his relatives in another village, possibly infecting untold others.

“Extremely, extremely concerning,” said Sylvie Jonckheere, the charity’s doctor on the scene. A colleague in full gear lectured the villagers of Teldou as the rain started, but was met with indifference or hostile stares; some turned their backs on him.

As the aid workers drove off, the private nurse who administered a shot to the Ebola patient defended his treatment. “I couldn’t say that he had the illness,” said the nurse, Eduard Leno. “His body was hot, that’s all.”

Asked why the patient had not been sent to the clinic in Guéckédou, he said angrily: “We are in the bush here. You can’t just send someone away. How will society view you?”

Local officials have begun a campaign to open the closed villages — there have even been some recent arrests in Kolo Bengou — but in tiny Koundony, fear is palpable.

On a recent day, a Red Cross truck drove up to the cemetery to deliver the body of Marie Condé, 14, wrapped in plastic sheeting.

As the body was carried off the truck, a high-pitched wail pierced the country stillness. “There is no cure!” a woman cried. “There is no cure!”

The gravedigger, Marie’s half brother Famhan Condé, 26, was sweating as he heaved shovels of dirt. The grave, he said, would be the 26th he had dug since the epidemic began.

“We’re all scared here,” he said. “There’s no solution. We can do nothing. Only God can save us.”"
196,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa," It is hard enough to push away family and friends, shunning an embrace or even a shake of the hand to protect yourself from Ebola.

But imagine trying not to touch your 2-year-old daughter when she is feverish, vomiting blood and in pain.

Precious Diggs, a 33-year-old contractor for a rubber company, had heard all the warnings from the legions of public health workers here in Liberia. She had seen the signs that dot the road from Harbel, where she works, to the capital, Monrovia, some 35 miles away: “Ebola is Here and Real!” they say. “Stop the Denial!”

But when her toddler, Rebecca, started “toileting and vomiting,” there was no way her mother was not going to pick her up.

“Na mind, baby,” Ms. Diggs whispered in her baby’s ear. “I beg you, na mind.”

Here in the heart of the worst Ebola outbreak in history, the question of whether to touch a stranger has only one answer: You don’t. But even in more intimate circles, in families and among lifelong friends, Liberians are starting to pull away from one another, straining against generations of a culture in which closeness is expressed through physical contact.

Liberia — from the elite doyennes who spend their days sending houseboys to the market to fetch oranges for them, all the way to the young boys on Tubman Boulevard who run up to cars hawking plastic bags of ice — used to be a tactile place. Everybody kissed friends, strangers and cousins, regardless of whether people met every day or had not seen one another in 20 years.

In a version of the genteel affectations that freed American slaves brought with them two centuries ago when they came here, the double-cheek kiss, for decades, was the standard greeting.

People often held hands while singing hymns at First United Methodist Church on Ashmun Street on Sundays, and after services sometimes took up to an hour to disperse, going systematically from cheek to cheek.

At parties in Monrovia, new arrivals went from person to person around a room, taking the hand of each seated guest as they bent down to kiss and chat. Sometimes it could take 15 to 20 minutes to make the rounds at a house party of just 10 people. When it was time to leave, the ritual began again.

That’s all gone now. Ebola is spread through bodily fluids: vomit, blood, feces, tears, saliva and sweat. Close contact has become taboo.

The Liberian government has decreed that taxis — which used to cram in six, seven, eight people, and in a recent case, four goats even — are allowed to take just three people in the back seat: fewer riders to touch one another.

Sylvester Vagn, 40, who was a corporate driver with a tech company before he was laid off a few months ago, said Thursday that even with only two people sharing the taxi with him, he still now jams his body against the door. Whichever arm is closest to his fellow passengers, he places it across his body and practically out the window.

“I sit so, with my head so,” he said, demonstrating how he leans his head as far away as possible. “And I bring jacket.”

Clara K. Mallah, 27, wears long sleeves, pulling them over her hands whenever her 3-year-old niece comes running up to her. Ms. Mallah, a national translator with an international organization in Monrovia, makes an exception only for her 52-year-old mother, a diabetic amputee who never leaves the house. Even so, Ms. Mallah has trepidation.

“If my mom could walk,” she said, “I wouldn’t touch her.”

Those close family ties expose the fragility of the belief that you can completely protect yourself from Ebola by keeping your hands to yourself. Can you really not touch an ailing mother?

Ephraim Dunbar couldn’t. When Mr. Dunbar, 37, got a phone call in late August that his mother had taken ill, he rushed to her house in Dolos Town, the enclave near Harbel where dozens of people have succumbed to Ebola. He found her in bed, vomiting blood.

His mind went immediately to the precautions against the virus. He did his best not to touch her. But as she grew worse, unable to keep anything down, he gave her milk, and tried to soothe her. His skin touched hers.

His mother died the next day.

Just after his mother’s funeral, Mr. Dunbar’s own forehead got hot with fever. For 15 days, he stayed at John F. Kennedy Hospital in Monrovia, fighting the disease. It was a fight he eventually won. But when he got out of the hospital, he found out that four of his sisters, his brother, his father, his aunt, his uncle and his two nephews had died. His entire family, wiped out in days.

On Friday, Mr. Dunbar said he would do nothing different. “That’s my ma,” he said, “that she the one born me.”

Levy Zeopuegar’s Achilles’ heel was his oldest sister, Neconie — “one father, one mother,” he described her in the Liberian way of distinguishing the special bond of full siblings in a country where half brothers or half sisters are common.

When Neconie got sick, her brother chartered a private car to take her to the hospital and climbed in with her. When the driver pointed out that blood was pooling from her nose, Mr. Zeopuegar turned to her with a towel.

Neconie died. Her husband, also in the car, died. Mr. Zeopuegar almost died as well, spending 19 days in the Ebola treatment unit in Harbel. For days, he hiccupped blood, feeling each day was his last, until finally, one morning, he woke up and knew he would live.

“You have to understand,” he tried to explain. “This Ebola thing. You will see your son or daughter sick in bed and say, ‘I not touching her?’ That is impossible.”

And yet, that is what Liberians must do to combat the virus. On the streets of Monrovia, it sometimes seems impossible. Children still run around in local markets pushing and playing. People in wheelchairs still roll up to cars at red lights, palms outstretched. Boys still push their way through the densely crowded West Point neighborhood.

Many people say they have not felt the warmth of human skin in months. Many do not shake hands or kiss any more. No caressing. No hugging.

But some still do. Sister Barbara Brillant, dean of Mother Patern College of Health Sciences at St. Theresa’s Convent, last week was driving down the street when she saw a young couple holding hands.

“Stop holding hands!” she yelled out the car window.

“They looked at me like I was crazy,” Sister Barbara said later.

So when 2-year-old Rebecca got sick, Precious Diggs picked her baby up. Rebecca did not make it, and died days later.

She passed Ebola on to her mother.

Weeks later, Ms. Diggs was released from a treatment unit. She sat in front of the discharge tent with a row of eight people, all recovered from the disease, all waiting to walk out into new and starkly different lives."
197,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa,"The best defense against despair was to keep working. Many times, that choice was far from obvious: Josephine Finda Sellu lost 15 of her nurses to Ebola in rapid succession and thought about quitting herself.

She did not. Ms. Sellu, the deputy nurse matron, is a rare survivor who never stopped toiling at the government hospital here, Sierra Leone’s biggest death trap for the virus during the dark months of June and July. Hers is a select club, consisting of perhaps three women on the original Ebola nursing staff who did not become infected, who watched their colleagues die, and who are still carrying on.

“There is a need for me to be around,” said Ms. Sellu, 42, who oversees the Ebola nurses. “I am a senior. All the junior nurses look up to me.” If she left, she said, “the whole thing would collapse.”

The other nurses call her Mummy, and she resembles a field marshal in light brown medical scrubs, charging forward, exhorting nurses to return to duty, inspecting food for patients, doing a dance for once-infected co-workers who live — “nurse survivors,” she called them enthusiastically — and barking orders from the head-to-toe suit that protects her from her patients.

In the campaign against the Ebola virus, which is sweeping across parts of West Africa in an epidemic worse than all previous outbreaks of the disease combined, the front line is stitched together by people like Ms. Sellu: doctors and nurses who give their lives to treat patients who will probably die; janitors who clean up lethal pools of vomit and waste so that beleaguered health centers can stay open; drivers who venture into villages overcome by illness to retrieve patients; body handlers charged with the dangerous task of keeping highly infectious corpses from sickening others.

Their sacrifices are evident from the statistics alone. At least 129 health workers have died fighting the disease, according to the World Health Organization. But while many workers have fled, leaving already shaky health systems in shambles, many new recruits have signed up willingly — often for little or no pay, and sometimes giving up their homes, communities and even families in the process.

“If I don’t volunteer, who can do this work?” asked Kandeh Kamara, one of about 20 young men doing one of the dirtiest jobs in the campaign: finding and burying corpses across eastern Sierra Leone.

When the outbreak started months ago, Mr. Kamara, 21, went to the health center in Kailahun and offered to help. When officials there said they could not pay him, he accepted anyway.

“There are no other people to do it, so we decided to do it just to help save our country,” he said of himself and the other young men. They call themselves “the burial boys.”

Doctors Without Borders trained them to wear protective equipment and to safely clear out dead bodies potentially infected with Ebola. They travel across backbreaking dirt roads for up to nine hours a day.

In doing their jobs, the burial boys have become pariahs. Many have been cast out of their communities because of fear that they will bring the virus home with them. Some families refuse to let them return.

After Mr. Kamara started working, his family said, he was no longer welcome in his village. His uncle, the family patriarch, told him never to come back. At first, he stayed with a friend, but the man’s wife was afraid and kicked him out, too. With no pay for months, he sometimes begged on the street after work to get enough money for food. Recently, he talked the owner of a small shop into clearing out enough space in a back room for him to sleep there.

He is finally getting paid, about $6 a day, and he hopes to find a room to rent, probably at an inflated price. Some of the other burial boys have tried to rent apartments but have been refused.

“If I have a long life, I can go back to my people,” Mr. Kamara said. “I can talk to them: ‘I’m doing this job for you.’ Maybe they can understand me.”

At the government hospital a few hours away in Kenema, photographs of the dead nurses are still plastered on the crumbling walls. Notes to young women suddenly cut down, like Elizabeth Lengie Koroma — “Lengie We All Love U But God Loves U” — offer visual reminders of the pain that remains.

“Today three, tomorrow four — it was just like that, rapid,” Ms. Sellu recalled, her cheery demeanor quickly dropping. “We said, ‘What is happening?’ ”

She added, “You are asking, ‘Who is next?’ ” In all, some 22 workers at the hospital died.

The nurses and doctors here had banked on their experience treating Lassa fever, another deadly disease that causes bleeding. But Ebola is of a different order, and they had never seen it before.

With the first cases, the nurses simply used their Lassa goggles. Ebola demands a far more protective face shield. They also used “light gloves,” Ms. Sellu said. Now, she puts on two layers of heavy-duty rubber gloves. The inadequate initial precautions had fatal consequences, even for the revered young doctor who headed the Lassa unit, Dr. Sheik Umar Khan.

“Such a careful man, always saying, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that,’ ” Ms. Sellu said. “That is the mystery.” Dr. Khan died on July 29, a huge blow to the nation.

Ms. Sellu also spoke about the nurses she had lost to Ebola. Usually so keen on projecting strength to her subordinates, she began to cry.

“It has been a nightmare for me,” she said, her features contorting. “Since the whole thing started, I have cried a lot.” She added: “It came to a time when I was thinking of quitting this job. It was too much for me.”

But the lesson she drew appeared inevitable to her. “You have no options. You have to go and save others,” Ms. Sellu said. “You are seeing your colleagues dying, and you still go and work.”

At the height of the deaths last month, her two teenage children and her family in the capital, Freetown, urged her to stop. The remaining nurses at the hospital staged a revolt. One morning, 40 of them appeared outside the door of her home in Kenema, yelling, “If one of us dies again, prepare yourself to die!”

Frightened, her children warned her. “ ‘They have come for you! Mummy, don’t go there again!’ ” she recalled. “And my relations in Freetown were saying, ‘Don’t go there again!’ ”

Ms. Sellu disobeyed all of them. “I was sneaking in at the end of the day,” she said.

With precision, she recalled the day the nightmare at the hospital began: May 25. In neighboring Guinea, where the epidemic started, the crisis had appeared, falsely, to be abating. In Kenema, a patient was bleeding profusely.

“The nurses were curious; they called me,” she said. “Dr. Khan said, ‘Do the test.’ ” It was positive for Ebola.

“The whole hospital went haywire,” Ms. Sellu said. “All the nurses were put into quarantine.”

But it was the second case, in the hospital’s private annex for V.I.P.s, “that put the calamity on us,” she said. The patient was a local chief suffering from severe diarrhea and vomiting. He infected three nurses and a porter. The porter and one nurse died. The dying nurse was pregnant and miscarried, infecting all four nurses who aided in the delivery. All four died.

“There are times when I say, ‘Oh my God, I should have chosen secretarial,’ ” Ms. Sellu said. But her job as a healer, she said, “is the calling of God.”

The Kenema hospital is a different place now. In the last several weeks, with international help, a more rigorous system for screening, filtering and holding Ebola patients has been instituted. Confidence among the nurses has been restored.

Outside the hospital, they continue to face stigma. Some of Ms. Sellu’s staff spoke of husbands abandoning them and neighbors shunning them. One nurse told of returning home to find her belongings in suitcases on the sidewalk, and her spouse warning her to stay away. Another nurse, seeking lodgings, lied to the landlord, telling him she was a student.

“If you meet with them, they will balance this way and that not to touch you,” said Veronica Tucker, a nurse who survived an Ebola infection, doing a little jig to demonstrate her experience on the streets of Kenema.

The epidemic goes on. International aid workers say the official figures — an estimated 2,615 cases and 1,427 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone — are almost certainly much lower than the real number of infections and deaths.

Ms. Sellu finds some reason for optimism, though. She has seen the flood of Ebola patients diminish. And she and her nurses are no longer alone in the fight.

“Some went, but we stayed,” said a nurse, Nancy Yoko. “We have kept coming. We never left.”

Ms. Sellu then shooed away her visitors, put on her suit and prepared for work.

“By the grace of God, it will end,” she said."
198,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa,"Days after Kaizer Dour died of Ebola at the edge of a mangrove swamp, strangers carried his rotting corpse in a dugout canoe for a secret burial. Out on an uninhabited, bush-covered island, far from the national basketball court where Kaizer won acclaim as one of Liberia’s most valuable players last season, the strangers fulfilled one of the most important duties of a Liberian family — burying the young man.

One of the men stood knee-deep in a shallow grave, shoveling sand over Kaizer’s 6-foot-2-inch body. The other, having steeled himself with swigs of a local gin called Manpower, gave a speech to bid Kaizer farewell in the absence of mourners.

“Your whole entire family, no one is here to represent you,” the man intones, his words captured in a cellphone video. “Your mother gave a rose that we should bury with you to remember her. She tried her best, but she was alone.”

The burial, one of countless unlisted deaths in the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, was an anonymous end for a middle-class young man on the cusp of celebrity. A rising star in Liberia’s top basketball league, Kaizer, 22, had dreamed of making it to the Los Angeles Lakers, the home of his idol and fellow shooting guard, Kobe Bryant. His Facebook profile, updated just three weeks before his death on Aug. 9, shows him spinning a basketball, an overhead light beaming down on a face bearing a young man’s self-assuredness.

A proper burial surely would have drawn hundreds of people — teammates, friends, fans and members of his large family, for whom Kaizer was an enduring point of pride. But this strange, horrific disease called Ebola, new to this part of Africa, had already started dismantling his unusually tight family, bringing fear, anger and ultimately death to the people who cherished him.

Ebola is a family disease, Liberians are reminded continually in Sunday sermons. The more families pull together to fight the virus, the more they seem to fall apart.

Kaizer’s extensive family had survived Liberia’s 14-year civil war, growing stronger as it united against poverty, rapacious rulers and indifferent governments. So when Kaizer got sick, his mother, Mamie Doryen, did what the Doryens had always done, turning to her family to help with her ailing son.

Kaizer, infected by his father, soon passed the virus to two aunts. In all, seven members from three generations died in quick succession. His mother, the family’s dominant figure, survived. But blamed for the calamity, she went into hiding, a pariah in her family’s hour of greatest need. The family’s center could not hold.

“Ebola was like a bomb,” one of Kaizer’s uncles said.

This destruction of families is the central tragedy of the epidemic. On a continent with many weak states, the extended family is Africa’s most important institution by far. That is especially true in the nations ravaged by the disease — Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — three of Africa’s poorest and most fragile countries. Ebola’s effects on the region, in undermining the very institution that has kept its societies together, could be long-term and far-reaching.

Even today, as help increases from the United States and other nations, many victims in the region are still being treated within the family, a place of succor — and a font of contagion.

“They were together, a strong family, but this Ebola broke the entire family apart,” said the Rev. James Narmah, a Pentecostal minister who knows Kaizer’s family. “That’s what’s happening right now. Ebola is bringing a lot of divisions, a lot of hatred, inside families and inside communities, everywhere.”

A Battle-Tested Family
Kaizer’s maternal grandparents, Joseph and Martha Doryen, had five sons and five daughters. All survived Liberia’s civil war from 1989 to 2003, a brutal one even by the standards of African wars of that era.

Before the fighting started, when rebels tried to oust the military dictatorship, Joseph Doryen worked as a driver at the agriculture ministry and then for a rich Ghanaian businessman. After the businessman fled the war, Joseph Doryen began growing potato greens in his Monrovia neighborhood, Capitol Hill. The children helped, and his wife sold the crop at a local market.

Until Joseph Doryen died three years ago, the old couple could often be seen strolling or sitting together under the mango tree behind their home. Their 10 children were all “same father, same mother,” a rarity in a large family of that generation.

They were also comparatively fortunate, escaping the rockets that frequently rained on Capitol Hill, destroying houses and killing residents.

Like its American model in Washington, the neighborhood derives its name from the nearby Capitol Building — one of the many ties between the United States and Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves in 1822. But being next to Liberia’s seat of government made the neighborhood a frequent target.

Not even the war, however, was as bad as Ebola, the family said.

“Even when we were fighting war at that time, you know the safe place to go,” said Anthony Doryen, 39, the second-oldest son. “This one, you can’t even know where to go.”

“Ebola is a disease that eliminates families,” he added. “It makes you afraid because when you get around your family, apparently you get in contact with it. It makes you go far away from your family.”

Today, Capitol Hill’s dirt paths snake around houses with corrugated roofs held down by heavy rocks. To the east, the Temple of Justice peeks above the palm trees. The president’s Executive Mansion is a quick walk to the south. The Liberian flag outside government buildings — red and white stripes, with a white star in a blue box — can easily be mistaken for the American flag.

For the Doryens, postwar Liberia led to better lives. Like most residents, they still got their water from aging, unsanitary wells. But because they had property in Capitol Hill, they were better off than most, with steady jobs as gas station attendants, government cafeteria workers, cellphone-card salesmen and market traders.

Just as they had during wartime, the Doryens pulled together during peacetime. The children built separate houses near their parents and tore down the flimsy old family home, pooling their savings to build an eight-room concrete dwelling. It offered stability, cohesion — and a refuge for an ailing Kaizer.

A Father on Ebola’s Front Line

For most West Africans infected during the outbreak, the virus was transmitted quietly, through tender acts of love and kindness, at home where the sick were taken care of, or at a funeral where the dead were tended to.

But for Kaizer’s father, Edwin Dour, Ebola came violently on the night of June 25 after a gravely ill man — Patient Zero to the Doryen family — was brought to the beleaguered government-run clinic where Kaizer’s father was the chief administrator.

Six of 29 employees at the clinic died within a month of Ebola’s arrival. Kaizer’s father, known for never turning away patients, became infected, too, passing the virus to his son in a pattern seen across the city. The sick brought Ebola to defenseless health centers that in turn often helped spread the virus.

Despite the money that the United States and other governments had funneled into Liberia’s health care system in recent years, health centers quickly crumpled. The 16-year-old girl who had brought the disease from Sierra Leone to Monrovia died in the state-run Redemption Hospital on May 25. A doctor and five nurses there, working without gloves or the basics of infection control, died in rapid succession.

Though Redemption often did not have running water, it was one of the biggest medical centers in Liberia. So after it was closed in a panic in June, the sick scattered to nearby clinics, including the one managed by Kaizer’s father. They were even less prepared to deal with Ebola’s onslaught.

On June 25, a yellow taxi dropped off a young man in front of the clinic’s gate. The patient, a church caretaker, had apparently become infected when an old woman with Ebola was brought in for prayers. By the time the caretaker showed up at Kaizer’s father’s clinic, he was exhibiting the full-blown symptoms of late-stage Ebola: vomiting, diarrhea and — a peculiar sign of Ebola — uncontrollable hiccups.

Around 10 p.m., the sick man became violent and confused. “He was fighting — unstable — he was just going up and down, coming down on the bed, turning this way, that way,” said the physician assistant on duty, Moses Safa.

The guard held the man down. “Then he gave up the ghost,” Mr. Safa said.

The guard himself would soon die of Ebola, though not before transmitting it to Kaizer’s father. The clinic’s medical staff, terrified by the deaths at the state hospital, offered the ailing guard minimal care. Kaizer’s father was not authorized to provide care, but he volunteered to put the guard on an intravenous drip — and was infected in the process.

Kaizer’s father tested positive for Ebola, but the government did not tell his family. In theory, workers are supposed to inform families of test results; in practice, few tests have been carried out and the results rarely provided — another systematic failure that has contributed to Ebola’s spread.

Kaizer’s father, who was in his mid-40s, died July 23. Because his parents had separated years before, Kaizer helped tend to his dying father. But as has been the case for thousands who have died during this epidemic, the natural inclination to care for a loved one would prove his undoing.

On Aug. 9, Kaizer’s father was laid to rest at Good Shepherd Funeral Home in a closed coffin. Though the funeral hall could hold 100 people, only about 20 came, mostly workers from the clinic and friends from the father’s days as a soldier in the Liberian Army.

No family member came.

Shared Denial and Death

Overwhelmed by Kaizer’s illness, Mamie Doryen had brought him by taxi to her family in Capitol Hill. As day broke, the neighbors learned that an ailing Kaizer had been carried in overnight.

Fear spread quickly. The neighbors, who knew that Kaizer’s father had died, lived in close quarters and shared a well with the Doryens.

It was early August, and the government, reeling from the deaths at Redemption and other health facilities, was paralyzed. Many Liberians remained deeply skeptical of Ebola’s very existence, suspicious of government corruption. The government slogan — “Ebola Is Real,” written on billboards and posters — merely reinforced the popular belief that it was not.

Still, enough deaths had occurred in the capital that, for many, any illness immediately caused suspicion of Ebola.

“We, who had family around there, were getting afraid,” said Teddy Dowee, 21, a friend of Kaizer’s and the Doryen clan. “I was afraid.”

It is perhaps a peculiarity of the psychological response to Ebola that people outside an affected family, like the Doryens’ neighbors, were often better able to grasp the reality around them.

Those inside the family often wrapped themselves in layers of denial, as impermeable as the protective suits worn by health care workers. They denied Ebola’s presence in the family to avoid being ostracized — and to convince themselves that they could tend to a sick loved one.

They often had no choice: Throughout the Ebola hot zone, the chronic lack of treatment beds for months forced families to care for the sick at home.

And so Mamie denied that Ebola had killed her former husband, Edwin Dour, and sickened Kaizer. Instead, they had both been poisoned, she insisted, telling her family of a mysterious woman in black terrorizing Kaizer in his sleep.

Some of those closest to Mamie accepted the poisoning story, a widespread belief in Liberia. They had reason to put faith in her. She was the family anchor, a woman of about 40 whose real name was Yah but was always called Mamie because she acted like a mother to her younger siblings.

So the family allowed Kaizer to stay, sharing one room with three family members — all of whom would die.

As Kaizer remained inside, the neighbors demanded that the Doryens take him away, threatening to call the authorities. But the poisoning story gave the psychological room for his relatives — caught between their love for him and the fear of Ebola — to take care of him.

One morning, Tina Doryen, an aunt tending to Kaizer, took a bath using a bucket in which he had previously vomited. “If that Ebola want to kill me, let it kill me,” she said, Mr. Dowee recalled.

With Kaizer’s condition worsening, the Doryens finally took him outside — to a nearby church that was holding a two-week revival.

It was already dark and the reverend, Mr. Narmah, was wrapping up a sermon on hope when the double doors of the church opened suddenly. Kaizer staggered in, his large frame supported on either side by his two favorite aunts — Tina, 20, and Edwina, 24. With Ebola in mind, the reverend instructed the aunts, both members of his church, to stay at the back with Kaizer.

“He had no strength,” Mr. Narmah said. “He couldn’t talk.”

The congregation gathered around Kaizer for a prayer. Mr. Narmah poured anointing oil on Kaizer’s head. He told the members to stretch their arms toward Kaizer but to not touch him.

Kaizer’s family took no such precautions. To Martha Doryen, 29, another aunt, Kaizer was the kid nephew who had always asked her for a treat or pocket money. This year, seeing Kaizer play basketball for the first time — and play so well that a fan handed him $50 after the game — Martha realized with pride that he was “no small player.”

“They were afraid of Ebola,” Martha said of the church members. “It was my sister’s only son. How can I be afraid? I can’t lie. I touched him.”

The Doryens’ neighbors stepped up demands that Kaizer leave Capitol Hill as soon as possible. The Doryens acquiesced, telling Mamie to take her son.

‘There Was No Family’

Kaizer died the next morning in his mother’s home next to the swamp. No one from the family, except his grandmother, went there to help.

“We were angry and also afraid,” said Kaizer’s uncle, Abraham Keita.

Mamie continued to insist that Kaizer did not have Ebola. Perhaps because of her assurances, five church members joined around her son’s deathbed. As Kaizer lay dying, he said he saw the woman in black who had been beckoning to him in his troubled dreams. He could no longer hide from her, she told him, as those gathered around him prayed loudly in tongues.

Abruptly, Kaizer reached for his neck.

“He said he saw the woman, the spirit, standing over him, choking him,” said Rose Mombo, a church member there. “He was fighting.”

Kaizer, his eyes wide open, burst into tears, spat out something and died.

It happened just as his own father was being laid to rest. During the funeral service for Kaizer’s father, the scattered attendees learned that Kaizer had died as well.

The government was still incapable of responding in the most basic ways, including collecting the highly infectious bodies of the Ebola dead. So two days after Kaizer’s death, the stench of his corpse seeping out toward her neighbors, his mother asked one of them, Jerome Mombo, to bury her son.

Mr. Mombo took precautions against Ebola, adding $15 of his own money to the $55 in American currency Kaizer’s mother had given him. He paid fishermen $60 and spent the rest on chlorine, a spray gun, six empty rice bags to sew together as a burial shroud and bottles of Manpower.

The men drank the gin before entering the room, then again inside.

“Otherwise, I couldn’t do it,” said Mr. Mombo, who later delivered the brief farewell for Kaizer. “I had to drink something to give me more power.”

Heavy rain allowed the fishermen to paddle all the way to a flooded area behind the home of Kaizer’s mother. Tony Kaba, 22, a basketball player and friend of Kaizer’s, stood at a distance and watched the men take the body away.

“There was no family,” he said.

It took half an hour down the Mesurado River to reach Kpoto Island, one of many uninhabited islands up a channel called Creek No. 2. With soft, sandy soil, Kpoto has long been used by the poor to bury their dead. Now, freshly dug graves are obvious in the thick bush.

Many relatives of Ebola victims are believed to have carried out secret burials across the region because bodies are simply not picked up in time, or the families do not want to surrender relatives for mass incinerations. Such burials are believed to contribute to a significant undercount of the Ebola dead in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

For Kaizer’s team, the Timberwolves, his death upturned the future. It had planned to build the franchise around Kaizer, who seemed destined to become the top player in the Liberia Basketball Federation, said Jairus Harris, the team’s vice president.

Kaizer was fast, shot well and fearlessly challenged any opponent. Over the years, two Liberians had come close to playing in the National Basketball Association in the United States, a source of pride for Liberian basketball.

“Kaizer would have made it in the N.B.A.,” Mr. Harris said. “I’m sure.”

Instead, his mother returned alone to Capitol Hill, seeking the comfort that the Doryens had always provided one another. But things were different this time. The consequences of the family’s rallying around Kaizer were quickly becoming clear.

Kaizer’s two favorite aunts, the ones who had held him up in church, died on the same day, Aug. 27, less than three weeks after he did. Kaizer’s grandmother and a cousin were visibly sick, too. Some of Kaizer’s uncles had fled Capitol Hill. The remaining Doryens gathered in a daze.

“It was a scene to behold,” said the Rev. Alvin Attah, who has known the family for decades. At the pastor’s urging, Kaizer’s grandmother boarded an ambulance to a treatment center.

Blamed for bringing Ebola to Capitol Hill, Kaizer’s mother could not return to her family home. She wandered toward her church half a mile away and knocked on the homes of congregation members, searching for a place to spend the night.

“But they refused to let her in,” said Felicia Koneh, a family friend. “Everybody was afraid. No one knows where she went after that.”

“It’s pathetic, you know, to see a family just fall apart,” she said.

Distance and Guilt
Ebola is an insidious disease. It turns compassion into a danger. It turns survival into a haunting source of guilt.

Kaizer’s cousin, Esther, 5, the daughter of his beloved Aunt Tina, was clearly sick. On the day Tina died, Esther’s father faced the anguish of going to see his ailing daughter in Capitol Hill — but being too afraid to get close enough to comfort her.

“She tried to get to me, but I stood at a distance,” said her father, Lester Morris, 27, who had separated from Tina this year. “I told her to go to her Auntie Julie.”

The guilt and pain of trying to protect himself was wrapped in a tight knot inside him, a feeling shared by many other survivors.

“To see a loved one separated from you, you talk on the telephone and say, ‘I’m dying,’ and you cannot go — it’s more painful than the war,” said Lester’s father, Joseph Morris.

It is a comparison heard often, one that may seem extreme. The war killed perhaps a quarter-million Liberians, Ebola only 2,800 officially in this country so far. The war’s destruction of Monrovia can still be seen in its broken roads, schools and buildings. Ebola has left no physical scar.

But to many Liberians, the pain of Ebola is greater. Often, the only sure way to survive is to abandon one’s family.

Esther’s father and uncle begged the government for help. The family repeatedly called its Ebola hotline to get her out of Capitol Hill, but received only empty promises.

It was late August, and the government was panicking. It had deployed soldiers to quarantine Monrovia’s largest slum, setting off deadly riots. The cost of paralysis by the international community was continuing to mount.

The Doryens worried that Esther would infect them, as Kaizer had. On Aug. 31, one of the remaining aunts, Julie Doryen, guided the girl with a stick to the main road outside Capitol Hill. Esther collapsed on the sidewalk.

A large, angry crowd watched from across the street, drawing the police and, finally, an ambulance. Esther, who had appeared dead, stirred to life. Her father, Lester, arrived minutes after she was put inside the ambulance.

She was taken to an Ebola treatment center. Her father and uncle visited and thought she was doing better.

Before visiting again, Lester looked wistfully at a Christmas card from last year. In it, wearing a red dress with a big white ribbon, Esther stands against an idealized American backdrop of a colonial house, a green lawn and a white picket fence.

Overnight, her uncle received a call from a friend inside the center. Esther had died. He did not tell Lester. On the taxi ride there, Lester began to suspect his brother was hiding something. By the time they arrived in front of the center at 10:30 a.m., Lester was yelling at his brother. Lester paced back and forth, his eyes reddening.

“He’s weeping,” said a man nearby.

“Maybe somebody dying?” said another.

“Brother, you gotta be a man,” a taxi driver said. “Be a man, yeah? Don’t be crying.”

Lester did not cry inside the center when told about his daughter’s death. He said nothing. His brother asked for the body for a proper funeral, or at least a photograph. Neither was possible.

The brothers went to Capitol Hill to inform the Doryens. The remaining family gathered outside. Martha Doryen, Kaizer’s aunt, started wailing, throwing her hands in the air. There were no tears, but the sound echoed throughout Capitol Hill.

With no body to bury, Lester could not meet his traditional duties. Suddenly, he started crying, uncontrollably, tears streaming down his face. The women, and his brother, looked away.

Coming to Grips
Within hours of the death of Kaizer’s Aunt Tina, the other aunt who had held him up in church, Edwina Doryen, died as well. Two weeks later, her husband, Mark Jerry, sat slumped outside an Ebola treatment center. Their daughter Princess sat to his right, resting her forehead against the wall. Both were too weak even to drink water.

For days, Mark had maintained his denials about the family illnesses. He was sick, too, but told friends he had typhoid and switched off his cellphone. After Princess fell ill, things changed.

“I’m convinced it was Ebola,” Mark said.

It was mid-September, and Liberia stood on a precipice. Monrovia had become the focal point of the outbreak in West Africa. Infections were doubling every two to three weeks.

Mark and Princess were lucky to receive treatment at all. But while Mark, 27, improved, Princess, 9, did not. She died within days.

After being discharged with a letter that he was “no longer infectious,” Mark began working for Doctors Without Borders. Once a denier of Ebola, he became an evangelist.

Mark, a money changer, and Kaizer’s Aunt Edwina, a restaurant worker, had spent years saving $900 to build their home, a simple structure steps away from the Doryen house. He had suspected that Kaizer had Ebola. The unease felt by the Doryens’ neighbors in Capitol Hill had unsettled him.

But he had blocked out those doubts when Edwina got sick. What else could he do but take care of her?

“Edwina and I were like one person,” he said. “I would bathe her. She was toileting all day. I would clean her, and then after two, three minutes, she would toilet. I would clean her again.”

He took her to a local clinic, where they were told that she had a chest cold. Finally, with Edwina unable to walk and bleeding from the mouth, Mark carried her on his back and put her in a taxi to the hospital. Turned away for lack of beds, she was taken to an Ebola holding center. She died there the next day, on a brown mattress on a filthy floor, surrounded by body fluids.

A rage built within him. All the suffering — all the pointless deaths in the family — stemmed from a betrayal, he said: Mamie’s refusal to admit what was wrong with Kaizer.

She had at least suspected the truth, Mark said. Once Edwina became symptomatic, Kaizer’s mother, the progenitor of the poisoning narrative, offered a suspicious warning.

“She said, ‘Mark, the way you’re taking care of Edwina, you got to get chlorine water on the side, and when you finish taking care of her, you wash your hands,’ ” he recalled.

“She acted very bad, my sister-in-law; she knew that her son had the virus and she never educated us,” Mark said. “To me, she was wicked. I don’t call that ignorance. I call that wickedness.”

Adrift in Anger
The disappearance of Kaizer’s mother quickly set the Doryens adrift, leaving them to endure one loss after another without their central figure.

Four of Kaizer’s aunts and cousins died in a month. Kaizer’s grandmother died, too, on Aug. 31. But the Doryens did not even find out about her death for nearly two weeks. Mamie, as the head of the family, gave her cellphone as a contact number when the ambulance took away the grandmother. When Mamie disappeared, health officials were unable to contact the Doryens.

Mamie’s absence stirred fierce disagreement, another source of division in the family. Some saw it as proof of her deception. Others, like her brother, Anthony Doryen, imagined her grief.

“Everybody is angry with her,” he said. But “she herself lose her mother, she lose her son, she lose two sisters.”

As word of the family deaths in Capitol Hill spread to Mamie’s neighbors near the swamp, they grew alarmed. Mr. Mombo, who buried Kaizer, reached Mamie by phone after many attempts.

“Why you running from place to place?” Mr. Mombo asked her. “But since then, her phone is switched off.”

Mamie insisted in a brief phone interview that Kaizer was poisoned and died after the woman in black told him he was “finished.”

“Everybody is carrying my name around,” Mamie said. “I didn’t do anything.”

“Nobody should blame me,” she added. “The devil is very busy. The Capitol Hill people saying I’m the one carrying Ebola there. All my family dying.”

Forgiveness and Hope
By late September, after the death of Kaizer and six of his close relatives, the sickness seemed at bay. Twenty-three days had passed since the last sick family member was taken out of Capitol Hill, two days beyond Ebola’s maximum incubation period.

“It’s good to stay alive,” said Abraham Keita, Kaizer’s uncle.

He smiled, stretched and brought out a DVD, “Monrovia on Fire,” a local martial arts film in which he had a supporting role. He hoped for a bigger part in a sequel. Mr. Keita, a furniture maker and taekwondo master, was planning for the future.

One of the Doryen brothers had returned to Capitol Hill, though he still kept his wife and children away. Mr. Keita hoped the other Doryens would follow, including Mamie.

“Before, yes, I was angry,” he said. “Everybody was angry with her.” He laughed. “Now I can forgive her. That’s what God says.”

“Maybe after one month, two months, she will come back, because we are the same family.”

In Liberia, too, the mood has begun to shift. New Ebola cases have dropped significantly, leading some international and local health officials to say they are making headway against the disease. On Thursday, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf lifted the state of emergency imposed on the country, saying “we can all be proud of the progress.”

Weeks earlier, Martha Doryen, Kaizer’s aunt, stood outside her house. A cellphone number and “Yah” — Mamie’s real name — were scribbled on the front wall with charcoal.

Mamie’s new cellphone number?

Instead, Martha looked at her 13-year-old daughter, who had just celebrated receiving her first cellphone by writing the number on the house. Her name is also Yah. Thirteen years ago, Martha asked her big sister, Mamie, to name her firstborn. Mamie named the girl after herself, Yah, a new generation’s hour come round at last.

Then, almost as an afterthought, Martha mentioned that Mamie had called that morning, the first time since she was forced from Capitol Hill a month earlier. Martha was sitting on her porch making dry rice with fish. An unknown number had flashed on her cellphone.

“She says she’s fine,” Martha said. “She’s just telling us to wash our hands, stay away from people and be with ourselves. Because herself, she is O.K., taking the same advice she gave us.”"
199,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa," “Where’s the corpse?” the burial-team worker shouted, kicking open the door of the isolation ward at the government hospital here. The body was right in front of him, a solidly built young man sprawled out on the floor all night, his right hand twisted in an awkward clench.

The other patients, normally padlocked inside, were too sick to look up as the body was hauled away. Nurses, some not wearing gloves and others in street clothes, clustered by the door as pools of the patients’ bodily fluids spread to the threshold. A worker kicked another man on the floor to see if he was still alive. The man’s foot moved and the team kept going. It was 1:30 in the afternoon.

In the next ward, a 4-year-old girl lay on the floor in urine, motionless, bleeding from her mouth, her eyes open. A corpse lay in the corner — a young woman, legs akimbo, who had died overnight. A small child stood on a cot watching as the team took the body away, stepping around a little boy lying immobile next to black buckets of vomit. They sprayed the body, and the little girl on the floor, with chlorine as they left.

As the Ebola epidemic intensifies across parts of West Africa, nations and aid agencies are pledging to respond with increasing force. But the disease has already raced far ahead of the promises, sweeping into areas that had been largely spared the onslaught and are not in the least prepared for it.

The consequences in places like Makeni, one of Sierra Leone’s largest cities, have been devastating.

“The whole country has been hit by something for which it was not ready,” said Dr. Amara Jambai, director of prevention and control at Sierra Leone’s health ministry.

Bombali, the district that includes this city, went from one confirmed case on Aug. 15 to more than 190 this weekend, with dozens more suspected. In a sign of how quickly the disease has spread, at least six dozen new cases have been confirmed in the district in the past few days alone, health officials said. The government put this district, 120 miles northeast of the capital, Freetown, under quarantine late last week, making official what was already established on the ground. Ebola patients are dying under trees at holding centers or in foul-smelling hospital wards surrounded by pools of infectious waste, cared for as best they can by lightly trained and minimally protected nurses, some wearing merely bluejeans.

“There’s no training for the staff here,” said Dr. Mohammed Bah, the director of the government hospital here. “The training is just PowerPoint. It is very difficult to manage Ebola here.”

In recent weeks, the world has vowed to step up its response to the epidemic, which has been spreading for more than six months. The United States has sent a military team to neighboring Liberia with plans to build 18 treatment centers to prop up the broken health system. The British have promised to build field hospitals in four urban areas in Sierra Leone, including this one. The French are setting up a treatment center and a laboratory in Guinea. The Chinese have sent scores of medical personnel to the region and have converted a hospital they built outside Freetown into a holding center for Ebola patients. The Cubans have pledged to send more than 400 doctors to help battle the disease in the region.

But little of that help has reached this city. The dead, the gravely ill, those who are vomiting or have diarrhea, are placed among patients who have not yet been confirmed as Ebola victims — there is not even a laboratory here to test them. At one of the three holding centers in Makeni, dazed Ebola patients linger outside, close to health workers and soldiers guarding them. The risk of infection is high, the precautions minimal. Patients are kept at the holding centers, receiving a minimum of care, until space opens up at a distant treatment center.

“We encourage them not to have contact with body fluids,” said the district medical officer, Dr. Tom Sesay.

There is no Ebola treatment center here and the patients, some of them critically ill, must be taken eight hours over bad dirt roads to the one operated by Doctors Without Borders in Kailahun — that is, when space is available there. Some die on the way. At least 90 people already have died in the district, health officials say — a figure far in excess of what the government in the capital has reported for Bombali. Yet the World Health Organization and others are still relying on Sierra Leone government statistics that appear to seriously undercount the number of victims.

Outside the district medical officer’s headquarters at the edge of Makeni — a mining hub in better days — ambulances race off constantly for new bodies. Reports of new cases poured in all weekend.

“We’re fighting to see how we can control it,” Dr. Sesay said. “But we’re not being helped by the fact that we have nowhere to take our patients.”

The survival rate in Bombali district is “low,” Dr. Sesay noted.

Indeed, the holding centers appear to be little more than stiflingly hot places to die. At one of the three in Makeni, known as the “Arab Hospital” because it was built with money from Gulf states, five had died overnight and into the morning one day last week; four more were expected to go by that night.

One of them, a small boy, lay curled up under a wooden bed frame, and a nurse explained that he was “in the last stage, vomiting blood.” Outside the building, a boy of around 10 propped himself up as best he could against a wall, blood around his eyes, defecating.

“A lot of babies are dying here,” said Mohammed Kamara, a soldier guarding the facility.

Three patients lay prostrate under a mango tree in the dirt courtyard, one of them motionless with his arms and legs fully extended, crosslike.

“When they start bleeding, they go inside, and they will not come back out,” said Evelyn Bangura, the nurse running the holding center. Close to 30 have died since the center opened on Sept. 20.

“I don’t want them to be outside,” Ms. Bangura complained. “We want to minimize the spread.” But some of the healthier patients are aggressive and have tried to break out of the facility; Mr. Kamara, the soldier, had to cock his gun, he said. Indeed, three men shouted from one end of the courtyard, demanding to be released: “So healthy for us!”

Some patients who ultimately tested negative for Ebola have been let out of the holding centers, prompting a large crowd to pour into the streets to celebrate this week, thinking it meant that Ebola had been defeated. The government quickly issued a statement saying that, to the contrary, the disease “is still with us and spreading fast.”

For many patients, the prognosis is bleak. “They are deteriorating day by day; even to swallow for them is a problem,” Ms. Bangura said, adding that the constant flow of bodies, and the hospital’s inability to help, were taking a toll on the beleaguered staff.

“To watch people like this deteriorating, deteriorating, it is like a psychological trauma for us,” she said. “Very painful for us.”

The nurses do what they can, dispensing anti-malarial medication, deworming the patients, giving them analgesics. But virtually all of those not already comatose appeared glassy-eyed and listless.

Down the road, an ambulance pulled up, delivering eight new patients to the third holding center; two were too far advanced to walk into the low-rise concrete facility at the edge of Makeni.

“The problem we are having is the little children,” said the chief health officer there, Unisa Kanu.

Unicef said Tuesday that the Ebola epidemic had orphaned at least 3,700 children in the region.

“Their mothers are already dead; we have seven orphans now,” Mr. Kanu said. “That is the problem we are having now.”"
200,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa," It has been sitting idly on the docks for nearly two months: a shipping container packed with protective gowns, gloves, stretchers, mattresses and other medical supplies needed to help fight Sierra Leone’s exploding Ebola epidemic.

There are 100 bags and boxes of hospital linens, 100 cases of protective suits, 80 cases of face masks and other items — in all, more than $140,000 worth of medical equipment locked inside a dented container at the port since Aug. 9.

Hundreds of people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone since then, and health workers have endured grave shortages of lifesaving supplies, putting them at even greater risk in a country reeling from the virus.

“We are still just hoping (!!!) — which sounds like BEGGING — that this container should be cleared,” one government official wrote in a frantic email to his superiors, weeks after the container arrived.

“It’s a mess,” said one foreign official working alongside the Sierra Leone government agency set up to deal with the crisis. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain vital relations with the government, said that nobody appeared to be in charge at the agency, known as the “emergency operations center,” and that different factions made decisions independently.

“It’s the only body responsible,” the official said. “What is it doing?”

In the case of the shipping container, the desperately needed supplies seem to have been caught, at least in part, in a trap that is common the world over: politics, money and power.

The supplies were donated by individuals and institutions in the United States, according to Chernoh Alpha Bah, who organized the shipment. But Mr. Bah wears another hat, as well. He is an opposition politician from President Ernest Bai Koroma’s hometown, Makeni — a place that clearly showed the government’s inability to contain Ebola.

A recent surge of cases there quickly overwhelmed health workers, with protective gear so lacking that some nurses have worked around the deadly virus in their street clothes.

More than 80 health care workers in Sierra Leone have died in the outbreak, and even in the capital, Freetown, some burial crews wear protective gowns with gaping holes in them, a clear indication of the urgent need for more supplies.

The government official who pleaded for the shipment to come in said that the political tensions may have contributed to the delay, to prevent the opposition from trumpeting the donations.

Mr. Bah said he thought the equipment would be welcomed by the struggling authorities, and he said he expected the shipping fee of $6,500 would be a small detail for Sierra Leone. According to the official, the government has already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola.

The shipping company, as a good-will gesture in a moment of crisis, had agreed to send the goods without being paid first, Mr. Bah said. But no more. Three other containers of similar value await shipment from the United States, he said, halted by the government’s long refusal to pay.

“We will appreciate if the payment is made quickly so that the medical supplies will be sent directly to the affected or targeted areas,” Mr. Bah wrote to the government on Aug. 16.

Instead, top government officials argued over the fee, said that the proper procedures had not been followed, and finally brushed aside the official urging that the supplies be let in, saying they wanted to hear nothing more about it.

“They are blaming us for shipping in without authorization,” Mr. Bah said. “It appears all they are interested in is cash donations. And all we have are supplies.”

At one point, a senior official close to the president, Sylvia Olayinka Blyden, acknowledged in an email that the items listed in Mr. Bah’s container were “very impressive.” But she said “future shipments” should follow procedure. That was on Sept. 1, and she has since left her post. The goods are still inside the container on the dock here.

“He should have contacted the ministry and discussed it with the ministry,” Yayah A. Conteh, an official at the health ministry, said of Mr. Bah, adding that the medical supplies would be cleared “very soon.”

In times of crisis, when needs are great and officials are overburdened, trickles of uncoordinated donations can be a distraction, some aid workers say, requiring a lot of attention without solving the biggest problems.

But some Sierra Leoneans say that the government’s resistance has discouraged other potential donors in the diaspora.

Ibrahim Kamara, a Sierra Leonean in Canada who has put together what he says is a $55,000 container of medical supplies, said that he was now encountering the same problems with the government — an unwillingness to pay the $5,000 shipping fee.

“There is no positive response, no feedback, no anything,” Mr. Kamara said. “It’s been over a month now.”

The emergency operations center was established to manage the urgent but confusing patchwork of agencies and international aid groups trying to battle the virus. The health ministry itself has been rocked by corruption and mismanagement scandals in recent years, further weakening efforts in a country that, even before the Ebola epidemic, suffered from some of the world’s worst health statistics after a brutal 10-year civil war.

Twenty-nine of the country’s top health officials were indicted last year in connection with the misappropriation of a half-million dollars in vaccination funds. The leaders were all acquitted. A free health care program set up by foreign donors has been damaged by corruption problems, with nurses illegally selling drugs and doctors charging for services. In 2010, a former health minister was convicted on corruption charges. This year, the health minister was pushed aside during the Ebola crisis amid questions over her competence.

At a recent meeting at the emergency operations center, local politicians discussed at length how they might be able to use the government’s recent three-day national lockdown — in which volunteers went door-to-door to educate people about Ebola — for their own political benefit.

Meanwhile, reported cases of Ebola are doubling every 30 to 40 days, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 620 deaths have been recorded, with the real number almost certainly much higher.

The government official who pleaded for the supplies to be let in argued that the epidemic, “like the war we experienced between 1991 and 2002,” had exposed the extent of government corruption.

The more urgent the pleas, the official said, the more it “elicited only disdain from some people in authority.”"
201,NYT,Staff,2015,Ebola Africa,"With treatment centers overflowing, and alarmingly little being done to stop Ebola from sweeping through West African villages and towns, Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, knew that the epidemic had spun out of control.

The only person she could think of with the authority to intensify the global effort was Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, which has a long history of fighting outbreaks. If the W.H.O., the main United Nations health agency, could not quickly muster an army of experts and health workers to combat an outbreak overtaking some of the world’s poorest countries, then what entity in the world would do it?

“I wish I could do that,” Dr. Chan said when the two met at the W.H.O.'s headquarters in Geneva this summer, months after the outbreak burgeoned in a Guinean rain forest and spilled into packed capital cities. The W.H.O. simply did not have the staffing or ability to flood the Ebola zone with help, said Dr. Chan, who recounted the conversation. It was a fantasy, she argued, to think of the W.H.O. as a first responder ready to lead the fight against deadly outbreaks around the world.

The Ebola epidemic has exposed gaping holes in the ability to tackle outbreaks in an increasingly interconnected world, where diseases can quickly spread from remote villages to cities housing millions of people.

The W.H.O., the United Nations agency assigned in its constitution to direct international health efforts, tackle epidemics and help in emergencies, has been badly weakened by budget cuts in recent years, hobbling its ability to respond in parts of the world that need it most. Its outbreak and emergency response units have been slashed, veterans who led previous fights against Ebola and other diseases have left, and scores of positions have been eliminated — precisely the kind of people and efforts that might have helped blunt the outbreak in West Africa before it ballooned into the worst Ebola epidemic ever recorded.

Unlike the SARS crisis of 2003, which struck countries in Asia and elsewhere that had strong governments and ample money to spring to action, the Ebola outbreak has waylaid nations that often lack basic health care, much less the ability to mount big campaigns to stamp out epidemics.

The disease spread for months before being detected because much of the work of spotting outbreaks was left to desperately poor countries ill prepared for the task. Once the W.H.O. learned of the outbreak, its efforts to help track and contain it were poorly led and limited, according to some doctors who participated, contributing to a sense that the problem was not as bad as it actually was. Then, as the extent of the epidemic became obvious, critics say the agency was slow to declare its severity and come up with plans, and has still not marshaled the people and supplies needed to help defeat the disease and treat its victims.

“There’s no doubt we’ve not been as quick and as powerful as we might have been,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a W.H.O. assistant director general.

Another W.H.O. leader agreed. “Of course in retrospect I really wish that we had jumped much higher much earlier,” said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the assistant director general in charge of outbreak response. “Of course I wish we’d poured in more and more earlier.” But, he added, “if this outbreak had been a typical outbreak, nobody would be saying we did too little, too late.”

The outbreak began close to the borders of three neighboring countries — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia — and spread surprisingly fast. Since then, the W.H.O. has engaged more than 400 people to work on the outbreak, including employees of other agencies in its network, and in August the agency declared the epidemic an international emergency, hoping to stop it from crossing more borders. Dr. Chan has met with presidents in the region, and last week the W.H.O. announced what it called a road map for a “massively scaled” international response.

The current outbreak has killed more than 1,900 people and spread to the point that the W.H.O. warns that more than 20,000 people could become infected. Sick people are dying on the street. Some feel the entire model the world uses to fight outbreaks needs to be rethought, so that an agency like the W.H.O. has the structure and mandate to take command.

But Dr. Chan said that governments have the primary responsibility “to take care of their people,” calling the W.H.O. a technical agency that provides advice and support. Still, she noted that her organization, like many governments and agencies, was not prepared.

“Hindsight is always better,” Dr. Chan said. “All the agencies I talked to — including the governments — all of us underestimated this unprecedented, unusual outbreak.”

A Shift in Emphasis
The W.H.O., founded in 1948, is responsible for taking on a wide range of global health issues, from obesity to primary health care. But since the world’s health needs far outstrip the financial contributions of the W.H.O.'s 194 member nations, those priorities compete.

The threat of emergent infectious diseases jumped high onto that list 20 years ago, when an outbreak of plague in India created a panic, sending about 200,000 people fleeing. The next year in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola killed about 245 people. With fears of cross-border infections high, a new urgency arose: improving the world’s ability to stop outbreaks.

The W.H.O. took the lead, at the request of its member nations. A crew of passionate outbreak veterans assembled a unique department, using an early form of electronic crowdsourcing to detect outbreaks and dispatching experts to the field. Three years after the effort solidified, the W.H.O. played a big role in responding to a cluster of deadly pneumonia cases in Asia. The new virus became known as SARS, and it was contained within the year, with most cases occurring in China.

To aid the fight, wealthy individuals offered the W.H.O. “literally hundreds of millions because their businesses were affected,” said Dr. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank and a former director at the W.H.O. “But as SARS burned out, those guys disappeared, and we forgot very quickly.”

Soon, the global financial crisis struck. The W.H.O. had to cut nearly $1 billion from its proposed two-year budget, which today stands at $3.98 billion. (By contrast, the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 2013 alone was about $6 billion.) The cuts forced difficult choices. More emphasis was placed on efforts like fighting chronic global ailments, including heart disease and diabetes. The whims of donor countries, foundations and individuals also greatly influenced the W.H.O.'s agenda, with gifts, often to advance specific causes, far surpassing dues from member nations, which account for only 20 percent of its budget.

At the agency’s Geneva headquarters, outbreak and emergency response, which was never especially well funded, suffered particularly deep losses, leaving offices that look, one consultant said, like a ghost town. The W.H.O.'s epidemic and pandemic response department — including a network of anthropologists to help overcome cultural differences during outbreaks — was dissolved, its duties split among other departments. Some of the main outbreak pioneers moved on.

“That shaping of the budget did affect the area of responding to big outbreaks and pandemics,” said Dr. Fukuda, who estimated that he now had 35 percent fewer employees than during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic — more than double the cuts for the organization as a whole.

“You have to wonder are we making the right strategic choices?” he said. “Are we ready for what’s coming down the pike?”

The entire W.H.O. unit devoted to the science of pandemic and epidemic diseases — responsible for more than a dozen killers, including flu, cholera, yellow fever and bubonic plague — has only 52 regular employees, including secretaries, according to its director, Dr. Sylvie Briand, who said that could be increased during outbreaks. Before the Ebola epidemic, her department had just one technical expert on Ebola and other hemorrhagic diseases.

Across Africa, the ranks of the agency’s regional emergency outbreak experts, veterans in fighting Ebola, were cut from more than a dozen to three. “How can you immediately respond to an outbreak?” said Dr. Francis C. Kasolo, a W.H.O. director. “It did affect us.”

And a separate section of the W.H.O. responsible for emergency response was whittled “to the bone” during the budget cuts — to 34 staff members from about 94 — according to Dr. Bruce Aylward, its assistant director general.

“You can’t make a cut that big, that deep, and it’s not going to have an effect on your operational capacity,” he said.

His group, charged with responding to wars, disasters and resurgent polio, was asked in August to assist with Ebola, too. “At no time that I can think of in the recent past have we been dealing with such a scale of human misery over such a broad geography due to such a range of hazards,” he said, including enormous population displacements in Syria, Iraq, the Central African Republic and South Sudan. But, officials warn, multiple, overlapping challenges may well be a feature of the future.

The W.H.O. hoped to balance its budget cuts by strengthening the ability of countries to respond to public health threats on their own. It put out new regulations for nations to follow to help contain outbreaks. But by 2012, the deadline it set, only 20 percent of nations had enacted them all. In Africa, fewer than a third of countries had programs to detect and stop infectious diseases at their borders. The W.H.O.'s strategy was often more theory than reality.

“There never were the resources to put those things in place in many parts of the world,” said Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a specialist formerly with the C.D.C.

A Disease Finds Its Opening
The Ebola virus took full advantage of these poorly prepared nations and the holes at the W.H.O.

Given the weakness in surveillance, the outbreak was not identified until March, in Guinea, roughly three months after a villager was believed to have contracted the virus from an animal, possibly a fruit bat. The delay allowed dozens of cases to spread through villages and even to Conakry, a capital of more than one and a half million people. Right away, Doctors Without Borders declared the outbreak unprecedented in its reach, the only group to do so.

Hastening the spread, hospitals lacked basic infection-control essentials like running water, protective gowns and gloves. Many doctors and nurses caught the virus from their patients, passed it to others, and died. The vulnerability and collapse of medical facilities revealed how far there is to go in achieving the W.H.O.'s top priority — ensuring basic global health care.

“This kind of outbreak would not have developed in an area with stronger health systems,” Dr. Fukuda said.

In the crucial weeks after the discovery, daily meetings brought together national authorities and foreign responders at the W.H.O. office in Conakry. But an absence of strong leadership and professionalism was notable from the beginning, participants said.

“It’s purely improvisation,” said Marc Poncin, the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Conakry. “There is no one to take responsibility, absolutely no one, since the beginning of the crisis.”

Stopping previous Ebola outbreaks had required meticulous tracking: monitoring people who had close contact with infected individuals and isolating them if they developed symptoms. Previously, “if we missed a case,” said Dr. Simon Mardel, a British emergency doctor deployed by the W.H.O. to help with the effort, “it was like a failure.”

This time, the number of contacts being followed was disastrously low from the beginning, only 8 percent in the epicenter of Guéckédou, Guinea, in early April, according to another doctor sent by the W.H.O. That meant the disease was silently spreading. Dr. Mardel said he thought the more experienced W.H.O. leaders who had left the agency “would have been very vocal, and they would have sought to put it right quickly, as a matter of urgency.” A single person who traveled and became sick could touch off a conflagration.

It was not that responders were not trying. Victims’ contacts were spread across a wide area, hours away on bad roads. The payment of local workers had somehow been overlooked, so they stopped doing vital, risky jobs. Essential protective equipment was not delivered to many who needed it. Bottles of bleach were given out without buckets. The W.H.O. lacked relationships with some longstanding organizations with large networks of health workers in the region.

Traditions that contributed to Ebola’s spread, including funerals where mourners came into contact with corpses, were not fully recognized or confronted, said Dr. Pierre Rollin, an outbreak specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who worked within the W.H.O. umbrella.

Some villagers blocked roads with tree trunks and drove Ebola workers away with stones, accusing them of bringing in the disease. Adding to the tension, only bare-bones clinical care was provided to try to treat patients, reducing the chances of yielding survivors who could act as ambassadors for the cause. Some doctors deployed by the W.H.O. said it should have given them more tools to care for patients.

Institutional and personal tensions flared. “Everyone’s working at a fevered pace,” Dr. Dowell said. “There’s confusion and chaos. It argues for a system that’s organized as much as possible ahead of time so people know their roles.”

One consultant thought it strange that the W.H.O. would not send Twitter messages with links to the C.D.C.'s Ebola prevention information, part of a policy not to promote material from other agencies. Various offices within the W.H.O.'s balkanized hierarchy also jockeyed for position.

The difficulties in tracking cases and gaining access to villages led many to think the outbreak was burning out. “I came home sort of thinking, with a little luck, that’s wrapped up,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, an Ebola outbreak veteran from Tulane University, who returned in May from a W.H.O. mission in Guinea.

The outbreak was not gone, just hidden. An herbalist in Sierra Leone contracted the virus treating Guinean patients. More than a dozen mourners at her funeral fell ill and seeded Sierra Leone. Some of them traveled back to Guinea and rekindled the outbreak there. After a lull of several weeks, cases re-emerged in Liberia, too, and reached the capital, Monrovia.

Dr. Bausch flew to Sierra Leone in July. “I was like, ‘where is everybody?’ ” referring to the shortage of health workers fighting the disease. “We all recognized we were really understaffed. We needed more people in the field.”

In some treatment centers, two or three doctors, wearing stifling gowns and masks in the heat, were caring for up to 90 patients. With the only W.H.O. logistician in the country working elsewhere, Dr. Bausch did not have anyone to accompany him and manage supplies of protective equipment, he said.

Dr. Bausch worked in Kenema, Sierra Leone, where he had helped set up a research program for another hemorrhagic fever, Lassa, which was common in the region. He knew some of the nearly two dozen health workers there who died after Ebola hit.

“It would be a logical question to ask, since Lassa was there, why was it so hard to switch gears” to Ebola?, Dr. Bausch said. But research institutes provided money for science, he said, not for disease surveillance and treatment. Those tasks had been left to the government of Sierra Leone, “one of the poorest countries on earth,” he said. “I always felt bad about this.”

In late July in Liberia, two Americans working at a missionary hospital fell sick and were soon evacuated home. A Liberian-American brought the virus by plane to Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. Suddenly, the world seemed to understand the threat.

The question now, experts wonder, is whether the leaner, retooled W.H.O. — heavy on technical know-how, light on logistical muscle — can surge in a way that will help lead the world in bringing one of the most challenging health crises in recent history to a close. W.H.O.'s road map calls for $490 million from donors, and thousands of foreign and local health workers to contain the outbreak. Yet few foreign medical teams have answered the call so far.

“It is incumbent on the international community to really respond now,” said Dr. Kasolo, a W.H.O. director in Africa. “Otherwise history will judge us badly.”"
202,NYT,Alissa Rubin,2016,Afghanistan Women," Parveena almost got away.

She was on her way home from a visit to her parents in a remote corner of eastern Afghanistan with her children by her side and a small group of women. Two men, their faces covered by kaffiyehs, pulled up on a motor scooter.

“Who is Parveena, daughter of Sardar?” said one, looking at the group of women, their faces hidden behind blue burqas.

No one answered. One of the men took his Kalashnikov and used the muzzle to lift the burqa of the nearest woman — in conservative Afghan society, a gesture akin to undressing her in public. It was Parveena, who like many Afghans used only one name. She grabbed the muzzle, according to her father and her brother, and said, “Who is asking?”

But the gunmen had seen her face, and they fired 11 bullets into her.

Parveena’s story — she was one of six policewomen killed in 2013 — is an extreme case, but it reflects the dangers and difficulties of Afghan policewomen and the broader Western effort to engineer gender equality in Afghanistan. The plight of women under the Taliban captured the Western imagination, and their liberation became a rallying cry. A flood of money and programs poured into Afghanistan, for girls’ schools and women’s shelters and television shows, all aimed at elevating women’s status.

But these good intentions often foundered against the strength of Afghan sexual conservatism. As the tale of Afghan policewomen shows, repressive views of women were not just a Taliban curse, but also a deeply embedded part of society.

Now, as Western troops and money flow out of Afghanistan, the question is just how much the encounter with the West and its values has really changed the country, and whether any of the foreign ideas about the status of women took hold.

In 2001, when the Taliban regime fell, women in Afghanistan were among the very worst off on earth: They had no access to education, women’s health care was scant, and government-sanctioned public beatings were widely accepted. Women rarely ventured out at all, and when they did, they had to be accompanied by a man and covered head to toe with a burqa.

Fourteen years later, there is a palpable sense of possibility for women, especially in urban areas. Girls are going to school in large numbers, at least up to age 11, and there is more access to women’s health care even in some remote parts of the country. However, in rural areas and in the Pashtun-dominated east and south, most women still live confined lives. They are subjected often to forced marriage, child marriage and beatings, and sometimes to honor killings. And conditions for Afghan women over all still rank close to the bottom among developing countries.

Hiring and training policewomen have been key priorities of Western governments and funders. They reasoned that Afghan women and girls, who face high levels of violence, sometimes on a daily basis, would be more likely to report abuse or seek help if they could turn to other women, and that meant ensuring there were women on the police force.

But those hopes ran up against the sexual taboos that haunt every interaction between men and women in Afghanistan. Policewomen have been branded as little more than prostitutes, dishonoring their families. That stigma means that mostly desperate women, usually illiterate and poor, have joined the force. In a society where coercive sex is a frequent tool, many endure sexual harassment for fear of losing their jobs.

Afghan policewomen, struggling to maintain good reputations, face a legion of logistical problems poorly understood by Western donors — a need for separate changing rooms in police stations, for example, since women are afraid to wear their uniforms on their way to work. After a decade and millions of dollars, even the modest goal of recruiting 5,000 policewomen remains a mirage. In fact, only 2,700 are on the force, less than 2 percent of the 169,000 members, according to the United Nations’ office in Kabul based on numbers from the Afghan Interior Ministry.

“The situation in Afghanistan is not prepared for women to work with men, and our community is not ready for female police to work here,” said Col. Ali Aziz Ahmad Mirakai, who heads recruitment for conservative Nangarhar Province, where Parveena worked.

Colonel Mirakai, who supports having more policewomen, sighed. “The police commanders I work with say: ‘We don’t need them to work with us until noon and go home; instead of female police, send us male police.’” he said, alluding to the reality that many women have to leave work early to care for their families.

To assemble a portrait of policewomen’s experiences, The New York Times interviewed more than 60 policewomen, male police commanders, Interior Ministry officials, Western military officials and staff members of nongovernmental organizations.

A United Nations report given to the ministry in 2013 but never publicly released — in part because of fears of possible reprisals against policewomen — found that 70 percent of the 130 policewomen interviewed had experienced sexual harassment, with smaller numbers reporting rape or more explicit pressures to have sex.

“The Interior Ministry’s and Afghan society’s generally negative view of policewomen, the lack of a confidential complaints mechanism, corruption, lack of facilities, discrimination and sexual harassment remain primary barriers,” said Georgette Gagnon, the head of the United Nations’ human rights division in Afghanistan.

The clash between Western ideals and Afghan realities means a program established to promote women has all too often backfired, subjecting the recruits themselves to abuse and retribution.

The small but real achievements have been in some of the family-response units, which give female victims a chance to talk to a policewoman and gain access to female lawyers.

“It’s the absurdity of imposing our liberal Western beliefs,” said a Western diplomat who has spent many years in Afghanistan and asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject for governments that have invested heavily in training Afghan women for the security forces. “It’s easy for us to put these women out there and tout their accomplishments, but then we leave, cut them loose, and what happens to them?”

Burdens at Home and Work
Like all the women who work with her in Kabul Police District No.10, Sharifa Aziza is too frightened to wear her uniform outside the office. She does not want her neighbors to know she is a policewoman.

Unlike most of her colleagues who stay inside a rickety trailer working as searchers and patting down women who enter the police compound, Ms. Aziza works in the family-response unit and occasionally helps with criminal cases. She counts herself lucky that she is subjected less to the harassment of younger male police officers, who bother the female searchers almost constantly.

One spring day, the windows of the female searchers’ small trailer were open and a policeman kept poking his head in, saying “Kiss me” to a young female colleague of Ms. Aziza.

“I have told him ‘no,’” the young woman said forcefully.

“I will not leave until I bite your face,” he said in a tone that was meant to be playful but that had an edge to it.

The woman looked at the floor. There is no effective confidential complaint system when policewomen are harassed. Senior police officials could not remember any complaints from women that had been formally prosecuted, and they minimized the problem.

Some women are pressured into giving in. “Good women are pushed into doing bad things,” said Madina, 21, a policewoman in eastern Afghanistan who would allow only her first name to be used to protect her safety.

Ms. Aziza’s boss, Nooria Sediqi, a second lieutenant who is about 50, displayed considerable knowledge of prostitution arrangements within the police. “The salaries are low,” she said of police pay. For a session of sex, a woman could earn $100 or even $200, she said. That is half a month’s salary for a junior policewoman, and a great deal even for a more senior one.

Occasionally older policewomen have acted as madams, procuring younger ones either for men within the police force or outside it, according to two of the policewomen interviewed for this article as well as Western officials who work with the police.

Interviews suggest that many policewomen, aware they have few useful skills and untrained in how to behave professionally, are vulnerable to sexual pressure. They are easy targets for more senior males who can withhold their pay or assign them to jobs far from home, and so policewomen are fearful of complaining.

Ten years ago, Ms. Aziza followed two of her brothers who had joined the security forces and enlisted with the police, hoping to earn enough to help sustain her family. In those early years of President Hamid Karzai’s administration, Afghanistan was full of promise. Women in cities had begun to take off their burqas and there was a widespread sense of a new start.

“It seemed to me then a very good and clean job,” she said.

Then her husband died of cancer and she had to take in the wife and children of her brother, who is a drug addict. Even though she earns twice as much as cleaners for the education ministry, her $240 monthly salary is nowhere near enough. After paying $100 for rent and as much as $80 for electricity, there is rarely more than $60 left for food, medicine and clothing.

“This is the room of a widow woman,” Ms. Aziza said, gesturing to the dark two-room hovel where she lives on an abandoned construction site. Outside, a broken bedspring sat between torn bags of cement, a promise of construction that was never realized. The sharp smells of urine and sour milk pervaded the house.

It was a Friday, her day off, and she flung open her sole cupboard to show her prized possessions. Her crisply pressed police uniform was draped in plastic to keep out the relentless dust. She showed certificates for attending police seminars, describing which dignitaries presided over each ceremony. Then she rummaged until she found a picture of a pretty 8-year-old girl smiling into the camera. “My daughter,” she said.

“Here, when a woman is widowed, she has to marry her husband’s brother and I refused,” she said. It was a moment of independence, but it quickly turned tragic.

Her mother-in-law, concluding that Ms. Aziza must be morally lacking when she turned down a chance to be respectable, took the child from her. While Afghan law allows a widow to have custody of her children, as a practical matter the lack of money often results in the children staying with relatives. Ms. Aziza sees her daughter now only once a year, on her birthday.

“She took my daughter by force,” said Ms. Aziza, staring into the photo as if the girl might walk out of it and into her arms. Tears came to her eyes.

Embarrassed, she looked away. Soon it would be time to make dinner and there was not much other than some bread left from the morning and a bag of okra.

Ms. Aziza’s family obligations are common among women in the police force, and often limit what they can accomplish on the job.

“They have to look after their children, cook, make dinner, clean; they have to leave early to take care of family matters,” said Col. Ali Akbar Mahmoudi, the former police chief in Ms. Aziza’s district, who is a supporter of policewomen. “None of the women police are coming during the night — just in some exceptional cases when we send them a police vehicle to pick them up for a raid.”

The men, by contrast, he said, “are flexible, they work all jobs, 24 hours; they pull guard at night.”

In fact, many of the women said they had been left to make their own way home after raids and only recently had been given separate toilets and changing rooms.

Ms. Aziza’s day starts in the dark hours before dawn when she rises to make tea before setting out at 6:30 a.m. for work, which begins at 8. Usually she takes a series of minibuses, squeezing into vehicles so packed with people that they are in danger of tipping over.

The need for transportation for women in a society where respectable women do not go out of their homes alone was one of the many details that escaped Western organizations that gave money for women’s empowerment, said Anastasiya Hozyainova, who worked as a consultant to the United Nations and the European Union. “The policewomen don’t receive transportation help, for instance, so how can a woman even get to work?” she said.

Under pressure by Western funders to meet gender targets, police officials hired any woman who would sign up. But there were few recruits in the countryside.

Col. Saboor Khan, who until 2014 was the longtime deputy for gender, children’s rights and human rights at the Interior Ministry, said that in traditional Afghan culture, “It’s a shame for a woman to work, and that also reflects on the family.”

Ms. Aziza works in the Gender and Family Response Unit of District 10, a section that exists at least nominally in every police department in Afghanistan to deal with domestic violence.

But many women are not allowed to leave the house except with a male relative, and often that relative is either the person who was beating her or someone in the family allied with him. And even if a battered woman is able to get away, there is a profound shame associated with talking about such matters to someone outside the family — even other women.

The result is that 12 years later, there are still relatively few cases for the units.

Of the 13 policewomen in the 318-member force in District 10, most are searchers. One, Feriba, stood in the trailer’s small entry, looking out at the scrawny shrubs in the yard. Her salary supports a disabled husband and six children. “Do you think we want to do this?” she asked.

“I would do anything else,” she said, answering her own question.

Ms. Aziza nonetheless believes that District 10 is better than most. Both the former Interior minister, Umar Daudzai, and the new one, Nur al-Haq Ulumi, have tried to push commanders to find jobs more suitable for women.

“They listen to women more here,” Ms. Aziza said. “In the past year, at least they gave us a separate toilet. Maybe they received much pressure from the world community and that has created pressure to take care of the women,” she said early in 2014, when there were still substantial numbers of American and NATO troops in Afghanistan.

“But I am worried,” she said. “After 2014, what should we do?”

A Woman in Command
Zarif Shaan Naibi is that rare figure among Afghan policewomen: a success story. The first female warden of Kabul’s women’s prison, she stands out among the overwhelmingly male command structure of the Interior Ministry.

Her realm is a barren patch of ground on the northeast side of Kabul with the three-story prison at its center. Six days a week Ms. Naibi goes to her office in a building next to the prison, and after attending meetings and signing paperwork, she wades into the prison itself.

Once painted white, the prison building is now badly scuffed, and the female prisoners seem to pour out of it. The prison has been overcrowded for years; at the end of 2014, it housed 33 percent more women than the 120 it was supposed to hold, according to prison officials. The women jostle to lean out of the windows and crowd at the front door, but there is nowhere to go other than the small bare yard, where even weeds seem to have a hard time growing.

Before she even reaches the stairwell, Ms. Naibi is besieged by women asking her for medical care, to arrange lawyers’ visits, or for help settling disputes.

A woman of medium height with hair either swept under a police cap or under a neat hijab, Ms. Naibi neither puts on airs nor appears particularly dominating, but her sense of purpose is unmistakable. She steadily navigates the prison’s maelstrom of emotion, keeping herself at arm’s length.

She relies on her rare ability to create privacy for conversations. She pats one inmate on the arm and then does the same to another, a gesture that is at once maternal and admonishing. She asks them to hug each other and makes them promise to stop fighting.

Her success appears to be rooted partly in her training in the late 1970s and the 1980s, when Afghanistan’s government was imbued with Communist ideology. The period offered exceptional opportunity for women, especially in urban areas.

As ethnic Hazaras, a group that was persecuted by the Taliban and has now embraced education and the modern world, Ms. Naibi’s mother and brothers allowed her to join the police, and when she married, her husband allowed her to continue. He is now in the Defense Ministry.

Ms. Naibi recalls that in her day all her teachers at the police training center were women. Now they are almost all men.

Under the Communists, women’s education was valued and candidates for the police were vetted, she said. “If she wasn’t educated, they wouldn’t take her. If she had graduated from high school, they would send her to the police academy.”

But these Communist ideals encountered resistance from much of Afghan society. Then under the Taliban, most policewomen were banished, and Ms. Naibi’s family, as Hazaras, had to flee. When the police were reconstituted after the Taliban’s ouster in 2001, the Afghan leadership was desperate for women to serve, calling former policewomen back to work as well as recruiting new ones.

For Ms. Naibi, it was a second birth. When the ministry put out the word, she went immediately — still wearing her burqa, required garb under Taliban rule, because she could not quite believe it was safe to take it off. Many other women came, too.

“We were standing in this room and then we began to recognize each other’s voices coming from under our burqas and we were saying: ‘Is it really you? Are you still alive?’”

More than half of her charges in prison today are there for moral crimes, a vast category that includes running away from home and intending to commit adultery. Either crime can taint a woman for the rest of her life.

Also among the inmates are policewomen, most of them in prison for running afoul of morality laws. Of the six there during a visit last winter, only one was accused of a violent crime (she tried to kill her husband).

Two appeared to have been victims of an unsuccessful effort to blackmail them into paying a bribe to avoid jail, but since they had no money, they ended up in prison. Forlorn and confused, they were embarrassed that they had accepted an invitation to have dinner with the son of a police commander, setting them up to be arrested for being alone with a man to whom they were not married.

Watching Ms. Naibi is a lesson in what could be possible for women in Afghanistan.

One morning, she was arguing with the male security guards about their schedules. “Just keep on one guy who knows everything,” she said.

The guards sat in silence, leaving it unclear whether they understood her instructions. One then complained that the ministry did not act quickly on personnel matters.

She sighed audibly. “Yes, O.K. we’ll fix everything, I’ll sort it out.”

The male guards saluted her when they left as they would a male commander.

“Yes, there will be negative discrimination against women, but it’s up to you to command authority,” Ms. Naibi said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a man or a woman — it’s your duty that defines you.”

Working in Secret
With five children and a disabled husband, Parveena, 28, was both desperate for work and overwhelmed by the task of caring for her family. There were few choices and none that would pay as well as being a policewoman, she said in an interview barely a month before she was killed in July 2013.

Parveena was attending a seminar for junior policewomen in Jalalabad, the largest city in conservative eastern Afghanistan, where tribal law often trumps government authority.

In contrast with a number of fully veiled women in the room, Parveena wore a white shawl over her head and had a warm open smile.

Of the 3,850-member force in Nangarhar Province in 2013, there were just 32 women, which meant most women worked alone in a sea of men, struggling to preserve their reputations.

“I am the only female where I work,” Parveena said then. “I don’t talk to anyone, I don’t give anyone my phone number or take anybody’s phone number. I just come at 8 and leave at 12 and then take the leftover food that people don’t eat for my kids,” she said, referring to the leftovers from policemen’s lunches.

Even then, she knew the risks. “My in-laws don’t support me,” she said, but then suggested that she had never told them about her job. “They don’t know; only my brothers know.”

Still, Parveena was enthusiastic about her work. Her father, a frail man of 70, said she liked it so much, she persuaded her younger brother to join the police as well.

Her commanders said they respected her hard work, so much so that they entrusted her with the dangerous mission of recruiting more women for the police force when she was visiting her home district of Lal Pur, near the Pakistani border.

Recruiting women for the security services can be dangerous even in a large city, but in a region where the government had no presence, it turned deadly.

All the more so because as much as a year before she was killed, the Taliban learned of her job, said Wali Khan, 21, her younger brother.

“She was doing the job secretly,” he said, telling only her immediate family and not wearing a uniform. “Then a year ago one of our relatives who was in the Taliban found out and he told people.”

That put her life at risk. Agnesa Shinwari, a member of the local provincial council, said, “In Afghanistan, if your husband allows you to work or your father allows you, it doesn’t matter.” The woman is still not safe, she said, if another family member does not approve.

She said she had heard that cousins of Parveena were involved in her death. The provincial police accused the Taliban, but local Taliban commanders denied involvement. After the killing, the family quickly called relatives who were in the Taliban and they heard there had been a spy, a person they knew in the community who had tipped off the Taliban to her visit to her home district.

Her brother’s casual reference to Taliban relatives is a chilling reminder of how hard it is to know which side people are on — or if they are on both.

Her father summed it up bitterly as he sat on a lumpy cot in the bare room in Jalalabad where he was visiting his son. “Who killed her? God knows, God knows better than I. Everyone is pulling a shawl on their face and calling themselves Taliban,” he said.

As word spread that Parveena had been killed, some whispered that she had had an affair or had been bold with men.

Madina, 21, a policewoman who attended seminars with Parveena, said the talk of immoral acts was a lie.

“She was a good and clean and honest woman,” she said.

Yet the stigma of being a policewoman remains so powerful that even after Parveena’s father and brothers picked up her body, they could find no mullahs in their village who would bury her or say the funeral prayers.

“There were six mullahs in our village, and after she was killed they disappeared intentionally,” her brother Wali said. “The Taliban had told the mullahs, ‘Don’t do a funeral ceremony for those people,’ and not one would say the prayers for my sister.”"
203,NYT,Alissa Rubin,2016,Afghanistan Women," Faheema stood trembling in the courtyard of the large house, steeling herself for the meeting with her family.

She took a deep breath and ran inside, her black abaya swirling around her, and fell to the floor at her uncle’s feet, hugging his knees, her face pressed against him, her shoulders heaving.

The reproaches came immediately. “How could you do this?” her uncle said. “You were always so sweet to everyone. How could you have done this?”

What Faheema, 21, had done was to run away from her home in eastern Afghanistan with the man she loved. She left behind her large family and the man that her family had promised her to. Although her uncle’s words at first seemed kind, his tone had a dangerous edge: Faheema had to come home.

For a young woman from an Afghan village to go home after running away with a man is tantamount to crossing a busy street blindfolded: There is a strong likelihood that she will be killed for bringing shame on her family.

Faheema, who like many Afghans uses a single name, was one of the lucky ones: She had made it to an emergency women’s shelter, one of about 20 that over the last 10 years have protected several thousand women across Afghanistan from abuse or death at the hands of their relatives.

These shelters, almost entirely funded by Western donors, are one of the most successful — and provocative — legacies of the Western presence in Afghanistan, demonstrating that women need protection from their families and can make their own choices. And allowing women to decide for themselves raises the prospect that men might not control the order of things, as they have for centuries. This is a revolutionary idea in Afghanistan — every bit as alien as Western democracy and far more transgressive.

As the shelters have grown, so has the opposition of powerful conservative men who see them as Western assaults on Afghan culture. “Here, if someone tries to leave the family, she is breaking the order of the family and it’s against the Islamic laws and it’s considered a disgrace,” said Habibullah Hasham, the imam of the Nabi mosque in western Kabul and a member of a group of influential senior clerics. “What she has done is rebelling.”

The opposition comes not only from conservative imams, but also from within the Afghan government itself. Lawmakers came very close in 2011 to barring the shelters altogether and in 2013 nearly gutted a law barring violence against women. They yielded only after last-minute pressure from the European Union and the United States.

Now, as the Western presence in Afghanistan dwindles, this clash between Western and Afghan ideas of the place of women means many of the gains women made after the 2001 invasion are at risk.

Although the Taliban’s harsh restrictions on women alienated many Afghans and helped rally foreign support for the war, the idea that women must submit to men remains widely held.

“A lot has changed since 2001, but most people still have conservative, traditional views of women,” said Manizha Naderi, who runs Women for Afghan Women, which operates shelters or other programs in 13 provinces.

That makes the fragile network of safe houses and the women who staff them even more vulnerable to restrictive legislation and attacks by local strongmen. The shelters, like so much of the Western project to coax change in Afghanistan, are emblems of a society in transition.

While the shelters have brought freedom to many women, others are stranded, safe for a time from their families but unable to leave because neither their families nor society accepts them.

Ms. Naderi estimates that about 15 percent of the women in her shelters cannot leave — ever. For these abused women, the longer they live suspended between two worlds, the less the shelter comes to feel like a haven and the more like a jail.

A Frightening Example
Above all, Faheema wanted to avoid the fate of Amina, an 18-year-old who ran away from her family in rural Baghlan Province in the summer of 2013 and whose case became widely known. She fled when her family told her she would be marrying an older man.

Amina made it to the provincial capital and was picked up by the Afghan Intelligence Service. Unlike many runaways, who are seen as fallen women and are prey to being molested by the police, she was not abused. Instead, she was brought to the women’s ministry office, which exists in every provincial capital in Afghanistan.

The women’s ministry sent her to the only shelter in the province. But after one or two nights, her family arrived. They promised not to harm Amina if she returned home with them, repeating that pledge on a videotape after meeting with the head of the provincial women’s ministry office, Khadija Yaqeen. The girl then climbed into a taxi with her family.

Amina never made it home. Nine men accosted the vehicle on a deserted stretch of road not far from her home, pulled her out and shot her, according to her family. No one else was harmed, they later told the ministry.

Women’s advocates and the police doubted the story. Why would armed men take just one young girl out of a car and shoot her? Why wouldn’t the family call for revenge?

The answer pointed to something far more sinister than a random holdup. In much of Afghanistan, a runaway is a tainted woman, who cannot be married off.

“This is the perception: Once she leaves the family, she’s in the hands of others, and they can do whatever they want with her — sexually abuse her — because she has left the family circle,” said Mr. Hasham, the imam in Kabul. By tribal custom, which is particularly strong in rural areas, a so-called honor killing is the only way to eradicate the shame.

The Baghlan provincial police chief, Amer Khail, believes Amina’s brother was involved in her killing, but said there were conflicting reports.

The women’s ministry office did not press for arrests. Amina’s short life and death drifted into sketchier and sketchier memory, with everyone involved claiming they had done the right thing.

Ms. Yaqeen of the women’s ministry said she had to let Amina go because she asked to leave with her family.

“Nobody had beaten her,” she said, “so I had no excuse to keep her.”

Ms. Yaqeen admits she was called by a member of the provincial council. She said the council member did no more than urge her to talk to the family, who had come to the provincial capital to get their daughter back. Provincial council members tend to be deferential to the desires of powerful local families, who would be eager to cleanse the family honor.

But Ms. Yaqeen said Amina made the choice herself.

It seems likely that a young girl, frightened and among strangers and faced by her angry family, would try to appease them because she could hardly believe that her family would be willing to kill her.

Women’s advocates in Baghlan have little question that this was an honor killing. “She should have been kept in the shelter for much longer,” said Homaira Mohammedi, the acting head of the Baghlan shelter at the time, who says that she was away the weekend that Amina came in.

“We did everything according to the rules and regulations,” Ms. Yaqeen insisted. “This is a problem of the society.”

A Family Confrontation
Faheema was sure that her family would not spare her if she left the shelter and went home.

“I had a problem with my father,” she said. “He engaged me to my uncle’s son, and I wasn’t happy to marry him, so I married another man.”

Her father told her he had bought a gun. “‘Wherever I see you both, I will kill you,’” he said before she ran away.

The desperation of her family to have her come home suggested that her view was correct. They were willing to agree to almost anything to pry her away from the safety of the shelter. A younger girl, or a weaker one, might have given in. But one of the most striking characteristics of many of the women who make it to a shelter is that, like Faheema, they have a sad but cleareyed understanding that they are in danger from their own families. This is often the first step toward being able to save themselves.

Unlike the Baghlan women’s ministry, where Amina had just one meeting with her family before she was given back to them, Women for Afghan Women requires repeated sessions between the young woman, her family and a mediator before she can go home. . The average number of meetings is about eight, said Nuria Kohistan, who mediated Faheema’s case. If the staff is not satisfied that the young woman will be safe, they will keep her as long as necessary.

Faheema’s third session with her family was a few days after the first and involved her mother, a younger sister, a younger brother and the brother of her spurned fiancé, who had been at the previous meeting.

The 45-minute session was filled with tears and screaming and bordered on physical violence — several times Faheema’s mother grabbed her daughter’s arm and held it in an iron grip as if to drag her from the mediation room, through the door and out the gate. A tall, thin woman with a frightening strength, she seemed to hold Faheema in her sway far more than the men in the family.

As if to protect herself, Faheema entered the room with a veil covering her whole face.

First her mother said to the mediator: “My daughter wants to go with us. Her father is now in the hospital.”

She turned to Faheema and said, “We will get you divorced from that guy,” referring to the man Faheema ran away with. Her fiancé’s brother and her mother said they would support her marrying someone else.

Ms. Kohistan, the mediator, said in an aside, “They’re saying these things, but as soon as they get custody of her, they will kill her.”

Heaping on the guilt and reminding Faheema of her shame, her mother said, “We have two houses in Ghazni, but we will sell them, because we can’t live in Ghazni anymore.”

The mediator pleaded: “Please talk about this in a way that this problem could be solved.”

Faheema put her head in her hands. Her 3-year-old brother knelt on the floor with his head under his mother’s long skirt as if he were trying to block out the sound of the warring grown-ups.

As it became clear that the shelter was not going to turn Faheema over to her family, her mother tried offering the mediator a bribe. “Please help us, and we will give you a gift,” she said, her voice pleading, tears in her eyes. Then she turned, almost spitting, to Faheema.

“You know your father, you know the character of your father,” she said. Gripping Faheema, she dragged her up from the chair. “He will kill me. You can come to my grave tomorrow.”

Finally, Faheema summoned her courage. “Why don’t you understand?” she said. “I already got married.”

And then she appeared to resign herself to the future. “This thing I did, I did. I cannot go with you, even if I lose everyone in my family,” she said and added, half speaking to them and half to the mediator, “I cannot go back home, because they will kill me.”

She pried her arm away from her mother’s grip and ran into the main building’s basement rooms. There, her mother could not reach her — she was kept out, and Faheema locked in, by a heavy metal gate. Her shoulders heaving, Faheema sank to her knees and wept hopelessly.

Never Going Home
The women in the long-term shelter try to cheat sleep by huddling together in the dark, their voices a way to ward off nightmares. The torments they endured at the hands of their families are written on their bodies. Knife scars traverse their faces and necks. Beatings with chains mark their backs. Some limp from broken bones that were never properly set. Several have faces eroded by acid, a favorite weapon here.

Daily life is an endless effort to escape the haunted precincts of memory; images of pummeling hands, the thumping sound of wood hitting their legs, of their bodies falling to the floor, the taste of blood in their mouths.

There are 26 women in the long-term shelter run by Women for Afghan Women in Kabul. If Faheema’s family continued its threats, this shelter would become her home.

That these women are still standing, and that some are trying to piece together complete lives, is a cause for wonder and a testament to their strength. In the safety of the halfway house, the women offer a glimpse into the worlds they have fled: muddy courtyards strung with laundry; screaming children and squawking chickens; cramped rooms for women and often not enough food. Women in Afghanistan are the last to eat, the last to bed and the first to rise.

Gul Meena, 16, survived a brutal attack by her brother after she fled an older husband, who had beaten her, and ran away with another man. She had been just 8 or 9 in her home in Kunar Province on the Pakistan border when a man in the next village offered money to her unemployed father for her.

In her innocence, she was thrilled to be given a white dress and makeup for the wedding ceremony. “I was thinking, this is the future, my husband would be buying me new clothes every day,” she said. In the car on the bumpy ride to her new home she remembers addressing her new husband as “uncle.”

“Uncle, please take care of me. I’m afraid I will fall,” she said as she bounced on his knee in the car.

From the moment she arrived in his house, she was a servant. The only grace was that he was not allowed to have sex with her before she had her first period. Two years after they wed, the moment came and he forced himself on her. “I was like a thing and they sold me,” she said. “He was beating me with everything near to him. With his glasses, with his mobile phone, with wood, with stones, and with his hands.”

Lonely and bewildered, she tried at least twice to return to her father’s house, but the family sent her back to her husband and finally she went to a neighbor’s home. The husband of the family ran away with her to Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan.

When her brother caught up with them, he slit the man’s throat and slashed Gul Meena 15 times with an ax, nearly blinding her and leaving her for dead. When she woke up in the hospital, she looked in the mirror. “I was very damaged,” she said. “Before, I was beautiful and young.”

Although she does not see herself that way, she is still a stunning young woman. She has never gone to school but speaks with a simple eloquence. Now she fears that she is ugly and no one will marry her. “Men are always interested in the beauty of a woman,” she said. “They are never interested in the heart.”

In the long-term shelter, most women feel a deep relief. No one is beaten. There is enough food. Chores are shared and, above all, there are choices: Some girls decide to go to school and try to make up for the years they were kept as virtual slaves. Others go to classes at beauty school in the hope of learning a skill that they will be able to use. One has a job as a house cleaner, and another is a skilled tailor and makes clothes while caring for her 6-year-old daughter.

“We try to find a solution,” Ms. Naderi said, but she admitted there were few options in Afghanistan. It is exceedingly rare for a woman to live alone here, and so the staff tries to help women recreate families when their own have shunned them. “Sometimes we can find husbands,” she said. “We’ve married maybe 10 or 11, but it’s difficult.”

While traditional attitudes remain deeply ingrained, women’s advocates do see changes. “Now women are finding a voice,” said Soraya Sobrang, a member of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. “And also they want to have some rights and have some decision-making. If you want to marry my daughter, you have to ask me as well. The men think the women want to deprive them of rights. This touches their pride. And this creates violence in the family.”

The battle between tradition and a fragile new sense of women’s rights continues. A government committee investigated the shelters after a television program accused them of forcing battered women into prostitution. The committee found that most of the shelters were well run.

The committee members recognized that most of the women were at risk of beatings or death if the shelters were closed or their capacities diminished, but no one wanted to defend the shelters publicly. The outcome relieved the women who ran the shelters and Western aid organizations: The government would not close the safe houses but, at the same time, there was little public support for spending money from the Afghan budget on them.

However, Ms. Sobrang said: “The international community has promised to continue support.” Such funding is essential if the shelters are to survive. Ms. Naderi relies on generous funding from the United States government, which accounts for close to 90 percent of her budget. The balance is raised from private, mostly foreign donors.

The women inside the halfway house understand the risks they would face if they had to leave. “I cannot go anywhere alone,” said Mariam, 22 who escaped an abusive Taliban husband and fled to the shelter. “Everybody likes to have their freedom, but I cannot have mine.”

Inescapable Fear
In the end, Faheema was able to leave the shelter, with the help of a lawyer provided by Women for Afghan Women. After four or five months, a court recognized her marriage to her husband, Ajmal, and the attorney general ordered her to live with him in Kabul.

But it is not exactly a happy ending.

Although they are in love, they live in terror of being cornered by a member of Faheema’s family and being beaten or killed. They live in poverty because Ajmal had to shutter his shop in their hometown, Ghazni, and cannot go there for fear of being killed. He has no money to start a new business.

A thin young man who wears Western clothes and, in keeping with more modern Afghan ways, does not have a beard, Ajmal comes across as serious and anxious.

“We live in fear and in hiding,” he said. Three times a day, when he goes out to buy a long loaf of Afghan bread, he finds himself looking around nervously to see if any of Faheema’s family is lying in wait for him.

He worries all the time about his widowed mother and two sisters, who still live in Ghazni. When he had his small cosmetics shop there, he contributed to supporting the family. But now, only his widowed mother’s meager income as a tailor helps feed the family.

None of this has weakened the couple’s resolve to be together, but it weighs on them because in Afghanistan, to not be able to go home is to be an outcast, almost an orphan.

Faheema tried to make peace between their two families and braved a phone call with her angry father to beg him to meet with elders from Ajmal’s clan. But her father refused to see them and said the only thing that would satisfy him is if they gave him a daughter to marry off to his son or nephew in exchange for Ajmal’s taking Faheema.

Despite the hardship, Faheema hopes her sisters and cousins will have the courage to demand that their families ask permission before making plans to marry them off. She wishes that her father had respected her enough to ask her. “My message to my father is that he should ask his children first before making any decision for their lives,” she said, wistfully.

In the cold Kabul winter, as they prepared to return to their small, damp apartment, which is all they can afford, Faheema said she had one more wish.

“Take us out of Afghanistan,” she said, “because we won’t be able to have a quiet life here.”"
204,NYT,Alissa Rubin,2016,Afghanistan Women,"The Taliban occupation of Kunduz may have been temporary, but what they did to Afghan women’s rights could prove to be lasting.

In a methodical campaign, the Taliban relentlessly hounded women with any sort of public profile, looted a high school and destroyed the offices of many of the organizations that protected and supported women in Kunduz.

Among those who have fled are the women who ran a shelter for female victims of violence, who Taliban commanders say are “immoral.”

Gone are educated women who worked for the government or international organizations; gone are some women who were school administrators and women who were activists for peace and democracy. They left, mostly at night, on foot or in run-down taxis, hiding under burqas, running for their lives.

“I won’t go back — I will never go back,” said Dr. Hassina Sarwari, the Kunduz Province director of Women for Afghan Women, which ran a shelter for abused women, a family guidance center and a center for the children of women in the Kunduz prison.

After the Taliban completed their campaign of burning and looting women’s organizations, they continued their attacks verbally, by text messages and telephone calls, threatening women and their relatives, making it clear that the women would remain in their sights. The Taliban’s message, based on interviews with a half-dozen women who received the warnings after fleeing Kunduz, was that they escaped this time, but that next time they would not be so lucky.

“Before we managed to take control of the shelter, Hassina Sarwari, the head of the shelter house, along with all the runaway sluts and immoral girls, had already left Kunduz city,” said Abdul Wali Raghi, a Taliban commander in Kunduz.

“Hassina Sarwari herself is an immoral slut, and if we had captured her, she would be hanged in the main circle in Kunduz city,” he added.

If in their publicity statements in recent years the Taliban had sounded more moderate, their behavior in Kunduz left little doubt where they really stand.

Within the first three days of the Taliban occupation, women who ran organizations aimed at helping women had their homes and offices looted, their computers stolen, their furniture, televisions and appliances smashed. Then, the Taliban left messages on their phones, or with relatives or neighbors, saying, “Return and you will be killed.”

Among the organizations destroyed by the Taliban were three radio stations run by women: One was burned, the other two looted. The Fatima Zahra girls’ high school and the Women’s Empowerment Center, which held social and political awareness sessions and taught women to sew, were also looted.

Women for Afghan Women’s office and children’s center were looted, its computers and cars were stolen, and the organization’s shelter for abused women was completely burned; it also appeared to have been attacked with sledgehammers, the windows shattered, the walls and door frames smashed.

Some allegations against the Taliban — that they raped women in the Kunduz University dormitory and the women’s prison — have not been proved. The accusation of rapes in the dormitory was broadcast on Tolo TV, and allegations of the prison rapes were broadcast on One TV. But the evidence supporting the allegations is still sketchy.

Taliban commanders and spokesmen forcefully denied that charge and threatened to kill “any staff or reporter” of either Tolo or One TV, calling them “satanic media” that repeated “propaganda.”

The Taliban noted that because their invasion of the city occurred during the annual Eid al-Adha holiday, the women were not even in the dormitory, but home visiting their families. The Kunduz University president, Abdul Qadoos Zarifi, said the same in a television interview.

What happened in the prison is less clear. Mr. Raghi, a Taliban commander in Kunduz, strongly denied the rape allegations. However, there are reports among some women’s groups of at least one woman being raped multiple times. Much remains unclear about that case, including who the attackers might have been.

Even amid the broader destruction in Kunduz over the past few days, including dozens of casualties and widespread building damage, the threat against women there was particularly chilling. That is in part because of how rare, and how recent, improvements for Afghan women have been in territories beyond Kabul, the national capital.

In Kunduz, known for having some of the most horrific cases involving women including at least two cases of stoning in the last five years, gang rape and rapes of children, it has taken years for women to feel secure enough to work there. Now that they feel targeted and under surveillance by the Taliban, they are unlikely to return or, if they do, are likely to choose jobs where they are less visible and less easily tracked.

“There is psychological damage,” Fiona Gall, the director of A cbar, an umbrella group representing nongovernmental organizations in Afghanistan, said about the effects on both women’s organizations and smaller humanitarian groups working in Kunduz.

“These people are going to be much more reluctant to do anything that stands out,” for fear that their families will be targeted, she said.

Fawzia Bostani, a civil engineer who works for the Ministry of Public Works in Kunduz, had been threatened for years by the Taliban. She was sure they would come looking for her once they entered the city.

She is the only female civil engineer working in Kunduz, she said. And her projects — including routing and restoring roads in Kunduz and its neighboring provinces, and taking part in an effort to learn the views of local women on the construction — have made her well known in the area.

The day after the Taliban arrived, she put on a burqa and slipped through the alleys to a neighbor’s house — it turned out just in time.

“That night the Taliban came to my house and said, ‘Where is that woman who is working in street building?’” Ms. Bostani said. “My older brother said, ‘There is no woman working in any organization doing that work in this house.’”

The Taliban members showed her brother a photograph of the corner of their block, saying that they had watched a car pick her up every morning.

As soon as the Taliban left, her brother called her and told her to flee. Although it was dark, she walked until she was at the edge of the city and then took a three-wheel all-terrain vehicle almost 70 miles to neighboring Baghlan Province.

A few days later, the Taliban returned to her house in Kunduz and left a message with her sister-in-law: “We don’t want to see her here again.”

Ms. Bostani said she has no plans to return to Kunduz.

The head of the Afghan government’s Women’s Ministry office in Kunduz, Naheed Asifi, also fled and made clear she was reluctant to return.

“If your life is in danger and you know that there is a significant threat, would you go back?” she asked. “I am sure you would not.”

Asked if the government will be able to find someone else to fill her job in Kunduz, Ms. Asifi said: “I don’t think anyone would go.”

Despite the sense of crisis and deterioration, Manizha Naderi, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, said she was sure that the organization would find a way to re-establish its services for vulnerable women in Kunduz, but acknowledged that it would take much more than finding new offices.

“I don’t see most of our people who worked in Kunduz returning, so it will be a big challenge for us to find staff,” she said.

She paused and added: “But, people need us so we have to come up with a plan. If we stop working, it’s a big victory for the Taliban.”"
205,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin,"Seeking to shine some light into the dark world of Internet trolls, a journalist with Finland’s national broadcaster asked members of her audience to share their experience of encounters with Russia’s “troll army,” a raucous and often venomous force of online agitators.

The response was overwhelming, though not in the direction that the journalist, Jessikka Aro, had hoped.

As she expected, she received some feedback from people who had clashed with aggressively pro-Russian voices online. But she was taken aback, and shaken, by a vicious retaliatory campaign of harassment and insults against her and her work by those same pro-Russian voices.

“Everything in my life went to hell thanks to the trolls,” said Ms. Aro, a 35-year-old investigative reporter with the social media division of Finland’s state broadcaster, Yle Kioski.

Abusive online harassment is hardly limited to pro-Russian Internet trolls. Ukraine and other countries at odds with the Kremlin also have legions of aggressive avengers on social media.

But pro-Russian voices have become such a noisy and disruptive presence that both NATO and the European Union have set up special units to combat what they see as a growing threat not only to civil discourse but to the well-being of Europe’s democratic order and even to its security.

This “information war,” said Rastislav Kacer, a veteran diplomat who served as Slovakia’s ambassador to Washington and at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, “is just part of a bigger struggle.” While not involving bloodshed, he added, it “is equally as dangerous as more conventional hostile action.”

For Ms. Aro, the abuse increased sharply last year when, following up on reports in the opposition Russian news media, she visited St. Petersburg to investigate the workings of a Russian “troll factory.” The big office churns out fake news and comment, particularly on Ukraine, and floods websites and social media with denunciations of Russia’s critics.

In response to her reporting, pro-Russian activists in Helsinki organized a protest outside the headquarters of Yle, accusing it of being a troll factory itself. Only a handful of people showed up.

At the same time, Ms. Aro has been peppered with abusive emails, vilified as a drug dealer on social media sites and mocked as a delusional bimbo in a music video posted on YouTube.

“There are so many layers of fakery you get lost,” said Ms. Aro, who was awarded the Finnish Grand Prize for Journalism in March.

As Ms. Aro’s experiences illustrate, Finland, a country at the center of Russia’s concerns about NATO’s expansion toward its borders, has emerged as a particularly active front in the information wars. A member of the European Union with an 830-mile-long border with Russia, Finland has stayed outside the United States-led military alliance but, unnerved by Russian military actions in Ukraine and its saber-rattling in the Baltic Sea, has expanded cooperation with NATO and debated whether to apply for full membership.

Public opinion is deeply divided, making Finland a prime target for a campaign by Russia.

“Their big thing is to keep Finland out of NATO,” said Saara Jantunen, a researcher at the Finnish Defense Forces in Helsinki, who last year published a book in Finland entitled “Info-War.” She said that she, too, had been savaged on social media, sometimes by the same and apparently fake commentators who have hounded Ms. Aro.

“They fill the information space with so much abuse and conspiracy talk that even sane people start to lose their minds,” she added.

Europe’s main response so far has been to try to counter outright lies. In November, the European Union launched “Disinformation Review,” a weekly compendium of pro-Kremlin distortions and untruths.

But facts have been powerless against a torrent of abuse and ridicule targeted at European journalists, researchers and others labeled NATO stooges.

Pro-Russian activists insist that they are merely exercising their right to free speech, and that they do not take money or instructions from Moscow.

The most abusive messages against Ms. Aro were mostly sent anonymously or from accounts set up under fake names on Facebook and other social media.

One of her most vocal critics in Finland, however, has openly declared his identity. He is Johan Backman, a tireless supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who highlights the blurred lines between state-sponsored harassment and the expression of strongly held personal views.

Fluent in Russian, Mr. Backman now spends much of his time in Moscow, appearing regularly in the Russian news media and at conferences in Russia as “a human rights defender.” He also serves as the representative in Northern Europe for the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a state-funded research group led by a Soviet-era intelligence officer.

Mr. Backman, who also represents the Donetsk People’s Republic, the breakaway state set up with Russian support in eastern Ukraine, denied targeting Ms. Aro as part of any “information war.” Rather, he insisted that Russia was itself the victim of a campaign of disinformation and distortion conducted by the West.

In a recent interview in Moscow, he said that Ms. Aro was part of this campaign and that she had tried to curtail the freedom of speech of Russia’s supporters in Finland by labeling them as “Russian trolls.” All the same, Mr. Backman added, her complaints about being targeted for abuse “have been very beneficial for Russia” because they have made others think twice about criticizing Moscow.

“She says she is a victim, and nobody wants to be a victim,” he said. “This changed the atmosphere in the journalistic community.”

Mr. Backman said he used his own private means to fund his activities in support of what he described as an “entirely defensive” campaign by Russia to counter Western propaganda. His activities, however, invariably follow Moscow’s political and geopolitical script, particularly on NATO, which he regularly denounces as a tool for United States military occupation.

Aside from NATO, Mr. Backman’s biggest bugbear of late has been Ms. Aro and the “Russo-phobic” tendencies that she, in his view, represents.

Just days after Ms. Aro made her first appeal in September 2014 for information about Russian trolls, Mr. Backman told Russian People’s Line, a nationalist Russian website, and other media that she was a “well-known assistant of American and Baltic special services.”

Around the same time, she received a call late at night on her cellphone from a number in Ukraine. Nobody spoke, and all she could hear was gunfire. This was followed by text and email messages denouncing her as a “NATO whore” and a message purporting to come from her father — who died 20 years ago — saying he was “watching her.”

The hardest blow, Ms. Aro said, came early this year when a Finnish-language news site, MVLehti.net, which is based in Spain and mostly focuses on vilifying immigrants, dug up and published court records that showed she had been convicted of using illegal amphetamines in 2004. She had been fined 300 euros.

The website’s headline: “NATO’s information expert Jessikka Aro turned out to be a convicted drug dealer.” It also posted photographs of Ms. Aro dancing in a slinky outfit at a nightclub in Bangkok.

Mr. Backman requested and received Ms. Aro’s old case file from the court shortly before the website published the documents. He denied passing them on to the site.

The false claim that Ms. Aro was a drug dealer triggered an unusual open letter signed by more than 20 Finnish editors infuriated by what they denounced as the “poisoning of public debate” with “insults, defamation and outright lies.” The Finnish police began an investigation into the website for harassment and hate speech.

“I don’t know if these people are acting on orders from Russia, but they are clearly what Lenin called ‘useful idiots,’” said Mika Pettersson, the editor of Finland’s national news agency and an organizer of the editors’ open letter. “They are playing into Putin’s pocket. Nationalist movements in Finland and other European countries want to destabilize the European Union and NATO, and this goes straight into Putin’s narrative.”

Ilja Janitskin, the founder and head of MVLehti, who is based in Barcelona, Spain, said in response to emailed questions that he had no connection with Russia other than his surname. His political views, he said, are closer to those of Donald J. Trump, not Mr. Putin.

He added that he had become interested in Ms. Aro only after she accused his website of “distributing Russian propaganda.”

Like Mr. Backman, he denied receiving any money from Russian sources, insisting that his website, which in just 18 months has become one of Finland’s most widely read online news sources, finances itself from advertising and donations by readers.

Ms. Aro acknowledged that she had used amphetamines regularly in her early 20s but dismissed as a “total lie” claims that she had been or is a drug dealer.

“They get inside your head, and you start thinking: If I do this, what will the trolls do next?” she said."
206,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin,"From a certain perspective, certainly the Kremlin’s, Vladimir Kara-Murza’s behavior in Washington could be seen as treasonous, a brazen betrayal of his homeland.

In a series of public meetings on Capitol Hill, Mr. Kara-Murza, a leader in the Russian opposition, urged American lawmakers to expand economic sanctions against the Russian government under a law known as the Magnitsky Act. That would hasten political change in Russia, he argued.

Back in Moscow a month later, in May 2015, the changes Mr. Kara-Murza detected were going on in his own body. Midway through a meeting with fellow dissidents, beads of sweat inexplicably dotted his forehead. His stomach churned.

“It all went so fast,” he recalled. “In the space of about 20 minutes, I went from feeling completely normal to having a rapid heart rate, really high blood pressure, to sweating and vomiting all over the place, and then I lost consciousness.” He had ingested a poison, doctors told him after he emerged from a weeklong coma, though they could find no identifiable trace of it.

While Mr. Kara-Murza survived, few others in his position have proved as lucky. He said he was certain he had been the target of a security service poisoning. Used extensively in the Soviet era, political murders are again playing a prominent role in the Kremlin’s foreign policy, the most brutal instrument in an expanding repertoire of intimidation tactics intended to silence or otherwise intimidate critics at home and abroad.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has made no secret of his ambition to restore his country to what he sees as its rightful place among the world’s leading nations. He has invested considerable money and energy into building an image of a strong and morally superior Russia, in sharp contrast with what he portrays as weak, decadent and disorderly Western democracies.

Muckraking journalists, rights advocates, opposition politicians, government whistle-blowers and other Russians who threaten that image are treated harshly — imprisoned on trumped-up charges, smeared in the news media and, with increasing frequency, killed.

Political murders, particularly those accomplished with poisons, are nothing new in Russia, going back five centuries. Nor are they particularly subtle. While typically not traceable to any individuals and plausibly denied by government officials, poisonings leave little doubt of the state’s involvement — which may be precisely the point.

“Outside of popular culture, there are no highly skilled hit men for hire,” Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University and an authority on the Russian security services, said in an interview. “If it’s a skilled job, that means it’s a state asset.”

Other countries, notably Israel and the United States, pursue targeted killings, but in a strict counterterrorism context. No other major power employs murder as systematically and ruthlessly as Russia does against those seen as betraying its interests abroad. Killings outside Russia were even given legal sanction by the nation’s Parliament in 2006.

Applied most notoriously in the case of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a Putin opponent who died of polonium-210 poisoning in London in 2006, murders and deaths under mysterious circumstances are now seen as such a menace that Kremlin critics now often flee the country and keep their whereabouts secret.

Russia has never acknowledged using the authority under the 2006 law and has specifically denied any government ties to high-profile cases, including the Litvinenko murder.

Among those fleeing Russia recently is Grigory Rodchenkov, a whistle-blower in Russia’s sports doping scandal.

This is not without reason. In the case over state-sponsored doping, two other officials with knowledge of the scheme died unexpectedly as the outlines of the scandal began to emerge. Just this month, another whistle-blower, Yulia Stepanova, a runner in hiding with her husband in the United States, was forced to move amid fears that hackers had found her location. “If something happens to us,” she said, “then you should know that it is not an accident.”

“The government is using the special services to liquidate its enemies,” Gennadi V. Gudkov, a former member of Parliament and onetime lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B., said in an interview. “It was not just Litvinenko, but many others we don’t know about, classified as accidents or maybe semi-accidents.”

Most recently, a coroner ruled that blunt-force trauma caused the death of a Kremlin insider, Mikhail Y. Lesin, 57, in a Washington hotel room last year, not the heart attack his colleagues first said. In July, the Russian Interfax news agency reported that Aleksandr Poteyev, 64, an intelligence officer accused of defecting and betraying a ring of Russian spies living undercover in American suburbs, had died in the United States.

Still, the Magnitsky Act, the law that Mr. Kara-Murza was in Washington urging lawmakers to expand, has proved to be perhaps the most lethal topic of all over the years.

Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer and auditor, was jailed on tax evasion charges while investigating a $230 million government tax “refund” that corrupt Russian officials had granted to themselves. He died in 2009 after having been denied essential medical care in prison, earning the Kremlin widespread condemnation.

In response, William F. Browder, an American financier who was the target of the tax fraud during time he spent working in Russia and had employed Mr. Magnitsky, campaigned in Congress for a law punishing the officials involved in the misdeeds and subsequent mistreatment of the auditor. The proposed measure, which eventually passed in 2012 as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Act, denied visas and blocked access to the American financial system for Russians deemed to have committed rights abuses and avoided punishment at home — including those involved in the Magnitsky tax fraud case.

Mr. Putin, perceiving an intrusion into his country’s affairs, campaigned hard against the measure. When it passed, he retaliated by ending American adoptions of Russian children. The law became a prototype for the blacklisting of prominent Russians accused of murders, human rights abuses and financial theft, among other violations.

The question of who was involved in the tax fraud became vitally important first to the investigation, and eventually to the final scope of the legislation. Access to inside information became pivotal and, it turned out, lethal. To date, five people who either handed over such information or were potential witnesses have died under mysterious circumstances that, in their sophistication, suggest state-sponsored killings.

One of the victims was Mr. Magnitsky, whose death was hardly the stuff of cloak-and-dagger security operations. Two others died before Mr. Magnitsky. And as the case gained greater prominence, others began dying under mysterious circumstances.

One victim whose death preceded Mr. Magnitsky’s, Valery Kurochkin, a potential witness whose name appeared on documents related to the fraud, fled Russia for Ukraine but died there of liver failure at the age of 43.

The other, Oktai Gasanov, a low-level figure in the fraud case but one who might have shed light on the group’s modus operandi, died of heart failure at 53.

Then, after Mr. Magnitsky’s death in prison, a fourth insider met an untimely end in a plunge from a balcony. A fifth, a banker linked to the scheme, Alexander Perepilichny, made it to London in 2009 and passed wire-transfer records to Swiss investigators. In 2012, however, at the age of 44 and in apparently excellent health, he suffered a heart attack while jogging. The police were left scratching their heads over the body found crumpled on a road in a well-guarded housing development, home to Kate Winslet and Elton John. An autopsy initially did nothing to clear up the questions.

It was not until 2015 that a botanist was able to identify the presumptive cause of Mr. Perepilichny’s death: His stomach held traces of gelsemium, a rare, poisonous plant grown in the Himalayas and known to have been used in Chinese assassinations. A coroner’s inquest is scheduled for September.

“All of this sounds like paranoid conspiracy theories,” Mr. Browder said in a telephone interview. “But there are too many of these happening to important people. Captains of industry and lawyers are not dying left, right and center like this in the West.”

Poison has been a favorite tool of Russian intelligence for more than a century. A biochemist, Grigory Mairanovski, labored in secret from 1928 on the task of developing tasteless, colorless and odorless poisons. In 1954, a K.G.B. defector described a secret lab near the agency’s Lubyanka headquarters and “experiments on living people.”

The agencies developed an arsenal of lethal, hard-to-trace poisons that, analysts of Russian security affairs say, is still in use. The Arab-born terrorist known as Khattab died in 2002 in his mountain hide-out in Chechnya after opening a letter laced with a form of sarin, a nerve agent.

In 1995, a Russian banker, Ivan K. Kivelidi, died after coming in contact with cadmium, which is deadly to the touch. His secretary died of the same symptoms, apparently because the poison had been spread on an office telephone handset. In 2008, Karinna Moskalenko, a Russian lawyer specializing in taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights, fell ill in Strasbourg, France, from mercury found in her car.

And in one case, a Bulgarian dissident, Georgi Markov, was killed on Waterloo Bridge in London in 1978 with an umbrella tipped with a pellet of ricin.

Mistakes abound. In 1971, a year after he won the Nobel Prize for literature, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn survived a poisoning attempt. Ricin, made from castor beans, was probably involved, according to news media accounts and a biography of the dissident writer. Ukraine’s former pro-Western president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, was left with his face disfigured after a dioxin poisoning — most likely concealed in a meal of boiled crayfish — that Mr. Yushchenko attributed to Russian assassins.

The attempt on Mr. Kara-Murza’s life turned out to be one of those mistakes, though that was not immediately certain. As his colleagues looked on surprised, Mr. Kara-Murza’s sweat-covered head flopped down onto a table.

The poison threw him into a weeklong coma with a puzzling range of symptoms, including swelling in his brain and kidney failure, giving his legs and arms a blue hue, his wife, Yevgenia, recalled.

He endured nerve damage that left him limping, but has otherwise made a full recovery. A French laboratory found heavy metals in his blood but was unable to identify a specific poison or explain how he might have ingested them accidentally. Mr. Kara-Murza, 34, has insisted that the police open an investigation. He is convinced that he ingested the poison during a flight on Aeroflot.

If so, it would not have been the first time such an episode occurred. In 2004, the opposition journalist Anna Politkovskaya drank poisoned tea on a domestic flight operated by Karat, another Russian airline, but she survived. Two years later, she was shot and killed in her apartment elevator.

“How can you protect yourself?” Mr. Kara-Murza’s wife asked. “What can you do? Not eat? Bring your own lunch everywhere? How can you predict a poisoning?”

Some do take precautions. Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion and now an opposition figure, has long had bodyguards carry bottled water and prepared meals for him.

In a chilling epilogue to Mr. Kara-Murza’s ordeal, a warning appeared in February on the Instagram account of Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya. It showed Mr. Kara-Murza outside the European Parliament building in Strasbourg, where he was speaking in favor of sanctions against Russia. He was in cross hairs, with a caption: “Those who haven’t understood will understand.”"
207,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin," With a vigorous national debate underway on whether Sweden should enter a military partnership with NATO, officials in Stockholm suddenly encountered an unsettling problem: a flood of distorted and outright false information on social media, confusing public perceptions of the issue.

The claims were alarming: If Sweden, a non-NATO member, signed the deal, the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil; NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval; NATO soldiers, immune from prosecution, could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges.

They were all false, but the disinformation had begun spilling into the traditional news media, and as the defense minister, Peter Hultqvist, traveled the country to promote the pact in speeches and town hall meetings, he was repeatedly grilled about the bogus stories.

“People were not used to it, and they got scared, asking what can be believed, what should be believed?” said Marinette Nyh Radebo, Mr. Hultqvist’s spokeswoman.

As often happens in such cases, Swedish officials were never able to pin down the source of the false reports. But they, numerous analysts and experts in American and European intelligence point to Russia as the prime suspect, noting that preventing NATO expansion is a centerpiece of the foreign policy of President Vladimir V. Putin, who invaded Georgia in 2008 largely to forestall that possibility.

In Crimea, eastern Ukraine and now Syria, Mr. Putin has flaunted a modernized and more muscular military. But he lacks the economic strength and overall might to openly confront NATO, the European Union or the United States. Instead, he has invested heavily in a program of “weaponized” information, using a variety of means to sow doubt and division. The goal is to weaken cohesion among member states, stir discord in their domestic politics and blunt opposition to Russia.

“Moscow views world affairs as a system of special operations, and very sincerely believes that it itself is an object of Western special operations,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, who helped establish the Kremlin’s information machine before 2008. “I am sure that there are a lot of centers, some linked to the state, that are involved in inventing these kinds of fake stories.”

The planting of false stories is nothing new; the Soviet Union devoted considerable resources to that during the ideological battles of the Cold War. Now, though, disinformation is regarded as an important aspect of Russian military doctrine, and it is being directed at political debates in target countries with far greater sophistication and volume than in the past.

The flow of misleading and inaccurate stories is so strong that both NATO and the European Union have established special offices to identify and refute disinformation, particularly claims emanating from Russia.

The Kremlin’s clandestine methods have surfaced in the United States, too, American officials say, identifying Russian intelligence as the likely source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

The Kremlin uses both conventional media — Sputnik, a news agency, and RT, a television outlet — and covert channels, as in Sweden, that are almost always untraceable.

Russia exploits both approaches in a comprehensive assault, Wilhelm Unge, a spokesman for the Swedish Security Service, said this year when presenting the agency’s annual report. “We mean everything from internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik,” he said.

The fundamental purpose of dezinformatsiya, or Russian disinformation, experts said, is to undermine the official version of events — even the very idea that there is a true version of events — and foster a kind of policy paralysis.

Disinformation most famously succeeded in early 2014 with the initial obfuscation about deploying Russian forces to seize Crimea. That summer, Russia pumped out a dizzying array of theories about the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, blaming the C.I.A. and, most outlandishly, Ukrainian fighter pilots who had mistaken the airliner for the Russian presidential aircraft.

The cloud of stories helped veil the simple truth that poorly trained insurgents had accidentally downed the plane with a missile supplied by Russia.

Moscow adamantly denies using disinformation to influence Western public opinion and tends to label accusations of either overt or covert threats as “Russophobia.”

“There is an impression that, like in a good orchestra, many Western countries every day accuse Russia of threatening someone,” Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said at a recent ministry briefing.

Tracing individual strands of disinformation is difficult, but in Sweden and elsewhere, experts have detected a characteristic pattern that they tie to Kremlin-generated disinformation campaigns.

“The dynamic is always the same: It originates somewhere in Russia, on Russia state media sites, or different websites or somewhere in that kind of context,” said Anders Lindberg, a Swedish journalist and lawyer.

“Then the fake document becomes the source of a news story distributed on far-left or far-right-wing websites,” he said. “Those who rely on those sites for news link to the story, and it spreads. Nobody can say where they come from, but they end up as key issues in a security policy decision.”

Although the topics may vary, the goal is the same, Mr. Lindberg and others suggested. “What the Russians are doing is building narratives; they are not building facts,” he said. “The underlying narrative is, ‘Don’t trust anyone.’”

The weaponization of information is not some project devised by a Kremlin policy expert but is an integral part of Russian military doctrine — what some senior military figures call a “decisive” battlefront.

“The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness,” Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, wrote in 2013.

A prime Kremlin target is Europe, where the rise of the populist right and declining support for the European Union create an ever more receptive audience for Russia’s conservative, nationalistic and authoritarian approach under Mr. Putin. Last year, the European Parliament accused Russia of “financing radical and extremist parties” in its member states, and in 2014 the Kremlin extended an $11.7 million loan to the National Front, the extreme-right party in France.

“The Russians are very good at courting everyone who has a grudge with liberal democracy, and that goes from extreme right to extreme left,” said Patrik Oksanen, an editorial writer for the Swedish newspaper group MittMedia. The central idea, he said, is that “liberal democracy is corrupt, inefficient, chaotic and, ultimately, not democratic.”

Another message, largely unstated, is that European governments lack the competence to deal with the crises they face, particularly immigration and terrorism, and that their officials are all American puppets.

In Germany, concerns over immigrant violence grew after a 13-year-old Russian-German girl said she had been raped by migrants. A report on Russian state television furthered the story. Even after the police debunked the claim, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, continued to chastise Germany.

In Britain, analysts said, the Kremlin’s English-language news outlets heavily favored the campaign for the country to leave the European Union, despite their claims of objectivity.

In the Czech Republic, alarming, sensational stories portraying the United States, the European Union and immigrants as villains appear daily across a cluster of about 40 pro-Russia websites.

During NATO military exercises in early June, articles on the websites suggested that Washington controlled Europe through the alliance, with Germany as its local sheriff. Echoing the disinformation that appeared in Sweden, the reports said NATO planned to store nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe and would attack Russia from there without seeking approval from local capitals.

A poll this summer by European Values, a think tank in Prague, found that 51 percent of Czechs viewed the United States’ role in Europe negatively, that only 32 percent viewed the European Union positively and that at least a quarter believed some elements of the disinformation.

“The data show how public opinion is changing thanks to the disinformation on those outlets,” said Jakub Janda, the think tank’s deputy director for public and political affairs. “They try to look like a regular media outlet even if they have a hidden agenda.”

Not all Russian disinformation efforts succeed. Sputnik news websites in various Scandinavian languages failed to attract enough readers and were closed after less than a year.

Both RT and Sputnik portray themselves as independent, alternative voices. Sputnik claims that it “tells the untold,” even if its daily report relies heavily on articles abridged from other sources. RT trumpets the slogan “Question More.”

Both depict the West as grim, divided, brutal, decadent, overrun with violent immigrants and unstable. “They want to give a picture of Europe as some sort of continent that is collapsing,” Mr. Hultqvist, the Swedish defense minister, said in an interview.

RT often seems obsessed with the United States, portraying life there as hellish. On the day President Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention, for example, it emphasized scattered demonstrations rather than the speeches. It defends the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, as an underdog maligned by the established news media.

Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor in chief, said the channel was being singled out as a threat because it offered a different narrative from “the Anglo-American media-political establishment.” RT, she said, wants to provide “a perspective otherwise missing from the mainstream media echo chamber.”

Moscow’s targeting of the West with disinformation dates to a Cold War program the Soviets called “active measures.” The effort involved leaking or even writing stories for sympathetic newspapers in India and hoping that they would be picked up in the West, said Professor Mark N. Kramer, a Cold War expert at Harvard.

The story that AIDS was a C.I.A. project run amok spread that way, and it poisons the discussion of the disease decades later. At the time, before the Soviet Union’s 1991 collapse, the Kremlin was selling communism as an ideological alternative. Now, experts said, the ideological component has evaporated, but the goal of weakening adversaries remains.

In Sweden recently, that has meant a series of bizarre forged letters and news articles about NATO and linked to Russia.

One forgery, on Defense Ministry letterhead over Mr. Hultqvist’s signature, encouraged a major Swedish firm to sell artillery to Ukraine, a move that would be illegal in Sweden. Ms. Nyh Radebo, his spokeswoman, put an end to that story in Sweden, but at international conferences, Mr. Hultqvist still faced questions about the nonexistent sales.

Russia also made at least one overt attempt to influence the debate. During a seminar in the spring, Vladimir Kozin, a senior adviser to the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank linked to the Kremlin and Russian foreign intelligence, argued against any change in Sweden’s neutral status.

“Do they really need to lose their neutral status?” he said of the Swedes. “To permit fielding new U.S. military bases on their territory and to send their national troops to take part in dubious regional conflicts?”

Whatever the method or message, Russia clearly wants to win any information war, as Dmitry Kiselyev, Russia’s most famous television anchor and the director of the organization that runs Sputnik, made clear recently.

Speaking this summer on the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Information Bureau, Mr. Kiselyev said the age of neutral journalism was over. “If we do propaganda, then you do propaganda, too,” he said, directing his message to Western journalists.

“Today, it is much more costly to kill one enemy soldier than during World War II, World War I or in the Middle Ages,” he said in an interview on the state-run Rossiya 24 network. While the business of “persuasion” is more expensive now, too, he said, “if you can persuade a person, you don’t need to kill him.”"
208,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin,"Facing trial in Russia over the theft of a street-art drawing valued by its creator at $1.55, Nikita Kulachenkov, a Russian forensic accountant involved in anticorruption work, fled to Lithuania to avoid what he decided was a doomed battle against trumped-up charges.

What he did not realize was that Russia’s reach these days extends far beyond its borders. Arriving in Cyprus from Lithuania in January to join his mother for a holiday, Mr. Kulachenkov was stopped at airport passport control, questioned for hours by immigration officials and then taken in handcuffs to a police detention center.

“They told me there was a problem with Russia and kept asking me what crime I had committed,” Mr. Kulachenkov recalled. Cypriot immigration and police officers seemed as mystified as he was, he said, by a note in their computer systems that described him as a wanted criminal requiring immediate arrest.

The wanted notice had been put there in August last year by Russia, where the theft of millions and even billions of dollars by the politically connected goes mostly unpunished but where the alleged theft of a street sweeper’s all-but-worthless drawing has been the focus of a lengthy investigation involving some of the country’s most senior law enforcement officials.

The arrest demand, known as a “diffusion,” had gone out to Cyprus and 50 other countries through the international police organization, Interpol. It had not been endorsed by Interpol, which is “strictly forbidden” by its Constitution from any action of a “political character,” but nonetheless labeled the 34-year-old anticorruption activist as a criminal in databases around the world.

Determined to punish domestic opponents who flee abroad, as well as non-Russians whose lives and finances it wants to disrupt, Moscow has developed an elaborate and well-funded strategy in recent years of using — critics say abusing — foreign courts and law enforcement systems to go after its enemies.

Some countries, including Russia, “work really hard to get Interpol alerts” against political enemies, said Jago Russell, the chief executive of Fair Trials International, a human rights group in London, because “this helps give credibility to their own prosecution and undermines the reputation of the accused.”

“It is also potentially a good threat to use against people still in the country: ‘You may be able to leave, but don’t assume you will be safe,’” he added.

The efforts have often fallen flat in the end, but have succeeded in tying up their targets in legal knots for months and years.

Acting on a Russian request, a British court, for example, froze the worldwide assets of Sergei Pugachev, a former close friend of President Vladimir V. Putin’s who fell out with the Kremlin in a squabble over property and fled to Britain, then France.

Russia has also used British courts and Interpol to pursue what many Western governments view as a vendetta against William F. Browder, an American-born British citizen. Mr. Browder was convicted in absentia in Russia of tax fraud after he fled to London and mounted an international campaign against Russia over the killing of his jailed Moscow lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.

Mr. Browder defeated a libel case in 2013 brought in London by a Moscow police officer whom the financier had accused of involvement in a fraud uncovered by Mr. Magnitsky. But he faces a new fight as Russia seeks to get British courts to find and freeze his assets and enforce a civil judgment against him in Russia.

The only winners in most such cases are expensive lawyers, for whom pursuing Russia’s foes in foreign courts has become a highly lucrative business.

Russia pushed three times between 2012 and 2015 to get Interpol to issue arrest orders against Mr. Browder. Having failed each time to convince the police organization that it did not have political motives, it announced this summer that it would try yet again.

“The Russians try stuff a hundred times, and sometimes it works,” Mr. Browder said. “They can fail 99 times, but the 100th time it could work. For them, that makes it all worthwhile.” He described the practice as “lawfare.”

Based in Lyon, France, and comprising 190 countries, Interpol defines its role as enabling “police around the world to work together to make the world a safer place.” It has often done this, allowing police forces to share information about the whereabouts of mafia bosses, murderers and other criminals, and to secure their arrest.

But the Interpol membership of nations — like Russia, Iran and Zimbabwe — that routinely use their justice systems to persecute political foes has stirred worries that wanted notices can be easily misused. In September, the congressional Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission heard a litany of complaints about abuse from experts and victims of Interpol notices during a discussion of how to reform the police organization’s system of so-called red notices.

Interpol issues such notices, which amount to an international arrest warrant, at the request of a member country seeking help in catching a fugitive who has fled abroad. Interpol’s computer system also circulates diffusions like the one against Mr. Kulachenkov. These are less formal than red notices, but are also used to request the arrest or location of an individual, or information, in relation to a police investigation.

Interpol does not release figures for how many red notices or other arrest alerts are issued through its computer system by each member country, but the number of people identified in Interpol’s databases as wanted criminal suspects has risen sharply in recent years.

In 2004, Interpol issued just 1,924 red notices at the request of member countries. Last year, it issued 11,492, as well as 22,753 diffusions.

As a result of one of those, Mr. Kulachenkov spent nearly three weeks in a Cypriot jail while the authorities in Cyprus reviewed a request from Moscow that he be sent to Russia to stand trial in a case that even Russia’s prosecutor general had initially ruled was not worth pursuing.

The drawing he is accused of stealing was done by Sergei Sotov, a street sweeper and artist who had left it and other examples of his work hanging on railings around Vladimir, a city east of Moscow. The street sweeper made no complaint to the police when the drawing disappeared, and said he was glad that someone liked his work.

In the end, Cyprus decided not to extradite Mr. Kulachenkov after Lithuania advised it that he had no criminal record and had been granted political asylum because of his work in Russia with Alexei Navalny. A prominent anticorruption campaigner and Kremlin opponent, Mr. Navalny himself has been ensnared in a tangle of apparently trumped-up criminal cases in Moscow, including the supposed art theft.

The Russian authorities, said Mr. Kulachenkov, whose name has been purged from Interpol’s databases, “don’t really care about me, but they wanted to send a message that if you get involved with Navalny, we will make problems for you, even if you leave Russia.”

Stung by criticism that its role fighting real crime is being hijacked by repressive regimes, Interpol has moved to strengthen safeguards against abuse, particularly since the naming of a new secretary general, Jürgen Stock, in late 2014. Mr. Russell, of Fair Trials International, acknowledged that the group “is trying to make it more difficult to game the system.”

Interpol said last year that it would not issue arrest notices against people who had been granted political asylum or other forms of refugee status, though this did not help Mr. Kulachenkov when he traveled to Cyprus in January.

Asked about that, a spokeswoman for the Interpol General Secretariat in Lyon said that she could not comment on individual cases, but that the policy of not targeting recipients of political asylum for arrest would work only if countries passed on information about who had been granted such a status. In most cases, she added, “this information is not available to the General Secretariat” when red notices or diffusions are issued.

Whatever Interpol finally does to stop the gaming of the system, it is too late for Petr Silaev, a 34-year-old Russian editor. Mr. Silaev took part in demonstrations against the destruction of a forest in Khimki near Moscow in 2010 and fled to Brussels seeking refuge after several protesters were badly beaten and the authorities branded the protests an armed riot.

He was later given political asylum in Finland and felt safe, until he took a trip to Spain to visit friends. Two days after his arrival, Spanish antiterrorism police officers stormed a hostel where he was staying and arrested him on the basis of a red notice issued against him by Interpol at Moscow’s request.

Held for nearly two weeks in a Spanish prison while a Madrid court approved his extradition to Moscow, he finally managed to phone a lawyer in Finland and contact Fair Trials International, which has campaigned against abuses of Interpol by repressive governments.

After appeals from a German member of the European Parliament and a storm of protest in the European news media, the authorities released Mr. Silaev from prison but ordered that he report to the Spanish police once a week.

Six months later, in early 2013, a Madrid court canceled Mr. Silaev’s extradition order and allowed him to return to Finland, where he spent another year pleading with Interpol to purge his name from its database.

“Interpol is a very Soviet-style organization,” Mr. Silaev said, describing it as “absolutely nontransparent” and easily manipulated by governments that regard protesters as no different from “rapists and murderers.” Interpol says it cannot publicly share information that belongs not to itself but to the member countries that provide it.

“It is a nightmare that keeps coming back if you don’t know how to fight it,” said Eerik-Niiles Kross, a member of Parliament in Estonia and former coordinator of the country’s intelligence services who has been targeted for arrest at least twice by Russia through Interpol.

Pilloried on Russian state television as a dangerous criminal, Mr. Kross has battled for years to purge international arrest orders issued against him. He and Estonian government officials say the orders are based entirely on fabricated claims by Russia that he was involved in hijacking a cargo ship off the coast of Sweden in 2009.

Mr. Kross, who is the son of a prominent Estonian writer arrested by the Soviet authorities and a frequent critic of Russia’s direction under Mr. Putin, believes the Russian accusations are payback for his work helping Georgia during its 2008 war with Russia.

“All Western institutions, particularly those in law enforcement, are based on good faith in government,” Mr. Kross said. “It is not foreseen that governments themselves are criminal. They can cook up anything they want and put it in the system, and the whole system starts to work against its purpose.”

Invented criminal cases, he said, “work like a computer virus: You put it in the system, and it starts to create havoc.”

Mr. Kulachenkov, the accused Russian art thief, said friends had warned him that Russia might try to get at him through Interpol. After his flight from Moscow to Lithuania in 2014, he wrote a lengthy letter to the police organization, pleading that it not list him as a criminal.

“It has become evident that Russian authorities use local investigation bodies and criminal justice systems to pursue their own political objectives,” he wrote. He detailed the Russian case against him for the supposed theft of the crude drawing that even Russian investigators, after inflating the artist’s initial evaluation of less than $2, valued at just $75.

He said he wished he had never taken the drawing, which he and a colleague gave to Mr. Navalny as a birthday gift. Taking the art “was a bad idea, but it was not a criminal offense,” Mr. Kulachenkov said.

“This whole thing is not about the drawing or me, but about Alexei,” he said of Mr. Navalny. “They are making him toxic. Anybody involved with Alexei gets a criminal case.”"
209,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin,"On a leafy side street off Independence Square in Kiev is an office used for years by Donald J. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, when he consulted for Ukraine’s ruling political party. His furniture and personal items were still there as recently as May.

And Mr. Manafort’s presence remains elsewhere here in the capital, where government investigators examining secret records have found his name, as well as companies he sought business with, as they try to untangle a corrupt network they say was used to loot Ukrainian assets and influence elections during the administration of Mr. Manafort’s main client, former President Viktor F. Yanukovych.

Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine’s newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials.

In addition, criminal prosecutors are investigating a group of offshore shell companies that helped members of Mr. Yanukovych’s inner circle finance their lavish lifestyles, including a palatial presidential residence with a private zoo, golf course and tennis court. Among the hundreds of murky transactions these companies engaged in was an $18 million deal to sell Ukrainian cable television assets to a partnership put together by Mr. Manafort and a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin.

Mr. Manafort’s involvement with moneyed interests in Russia and Ukraine had previously come to light. But as American relationships there become a rising issue in the presidential campaign — from Mr. Trump’s favorable statements about Mr. Putin and his annexation of Crimea to the suspected Russian hacking of Democrats’ emails — an examination of Mr. Manafort’s activities offers new details of how he mixed politics and business out of public view and benefited from powerful interests now under scrutiny by the new government in Kiev.

Anti-corruption officials there say the payments earmarked for Mr. Manafort, previously unreported, are a focus of their investigation, though they have yet to determine if he actually received the cash. While Mr. Manafort is not a target in the separate inquiry of offshore activities, prosecutors say he must have realized the implications of his financial dealings.

“He understood what was happening in Ukraine,” said Vitaliy Kasko, a former senior official with the general prosecutor’s office in Kiev. “It would have to be clear to any reasonable person that the Yanukovych clan, when it came to power, was engaged in corruption.”

Mr. Kasko added, “It’s impossible to imagine a person would look at this and think, ‘Everything is all right.’”

Mr. Manafort did not respond to interview requests or written questions from The New York Times. But his lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said Mr. Manafort had not received “any such cash payments” described by the anti-corruption officials.

Mr. Hibey also disputed Mr. Kasko’s suggestion that Mr. Manafort might have countenanced corruption or been involved with people who took part in illegal activities.

“These are suspicions, and probably heavily politically tinged ones,” said Mr. Hibey, a member of the Washington law firm Miller & Chevalier. “It is difficult to respect any kind of allegation of the sort being made here to smear someone when there is no proof and we deny there ever could be such proof.”

Mysterious Payments
The developments in Ukraine underscore the risky nature of the international consulting that has been a staple of Mr. Manafort’s business since the 1980s, when he went to work for the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Before joining Mr. Trump’s campaign this spring, Mr. Manafort’s most prominent recent client was Mr. Yanukovych, who — like Mr. Marcos — was deposed in a popular uprising.

Before he fled to Russia two years ago, Mr. Yanukovych and his Party of Regions relied heavily on the advice of Mr. Manafort and his firm, who helped them win several elections. During that period, Mr. Manafort never registered as a foreign agent with the United States Justice Department — as required of those seeking to influence American policy on behalf of foreign clients — although one of his subcontractors did.

It is unclear if Mr. Manafort’s activities necessitated registering. If they were limited to advising the Party of Regions in Ukraine, he probably would not have had to. But he also worked to burnish his client’s image in the West and helped Mr. Yanukovych’s administration draft a report defending its prosecution of his chief rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, in 2012.

Whatever the case, absent a registration — which requires disclosure of how much the registrant is being paid and by whom — Mr. Manafort’s compensation has remained a mystery. However, a cache of documents discovered after the fall of Mr. Yanukovych’s government may provide some answers.

The papers, known in Ukraine as the “black ledger,” are a chicken-scratch of Cyrillic covering about 400 pages taken from books once kept in a third-floor room in the former Party of Regions headquarters on Lipskaya Street in Kiev. The room held two safes stuffed with $100 bills, said Taras V. Chornovil, a former party leader who was also a recipient of the money at times. He said in an interview that he had once received $10,000 in a “wad of cash” for a trip to Europe.

“This was our cash,” he said, adding that he had left the party in part over concerns about off-the-books activity. “They had it on the table, stacks of money, and they had lists of who to pay.”

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which obtained the ledger, said in a statement that Mr. Manafort’s name appeared 22 times in the documents over five years, with payments totaling $12.7 million. The purpose of the payments is not clear. Nor is the outcome, since the handwritten entries cannot be cross-referenced against banking records, and the signatures for receipt have not yet been verified.

“Paul Manafort is among those names on the list of so-called ‘black accounts of the Party of Regions,’ which the detectives of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are investigating,” the statement said. “We emphasize that the presence of P. Manafort’s name in the list does not mean that he actually got the money, because the signatures that appear in the column of recipients could belong to other people.”

The accounting records surfaced this year, when Serhiy A. Leshchenko, a member of Parliament who said he had received a partial copy from a source he did not identify, published line items covering six months of outlays in 2012 totaling $66 million. In an interview, Mr. Leshchenko said another source had provided the entire multiyear ledger to Viktor M. Trepak, a former deputy director of the domestic intelligence agency of Ukraine, the S.B.U., who passed it to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau.

The bureau, whose government funding is mandated under American and European Union aid programs and which has an evidence-sharing agreement with the F.B.I., has investigatory powers but cannot indict suspects. Only if it passes its findings to prosecutors — which has not happened with Mr. Manafort — does a subject of its inquiry become part of a criminal case.

Individual disbursements reflected in the ledgers ranged from a few hundred dollars to millions of dollars. Of the records released from 2012, one shows a payment of $67,000 for a watch and another of $8.4 million to the owner of an advertising agency for campaign work for the party before elections that year.

“It’s a very vivid example of how political parties are financed in Ukraine,” said Daria N. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Kiev. “It represents the very dirty cash economy in Ukraine.”

Offshore Companies
While working in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort had also positioned himself to profit from business deals that benefited from connections he had gained through his political consulting. One of them, according to court filings, involved a network of offshore companies that government investigators and independent journalists in Ukraine have said was used to launder public money and assets purportedly stolen by cronies of the government.

The network comprised shell companies whose ultimate owners were shielded by the secrecy laws of the offshore jurisdictions where they were registered, including the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Seychelles.

In a recent interview, Serhiy V. Gorbatyuk, Ukraine’s special prosecutor for high-level corruption cases, pointed to an open file on his desk containing paperwork for one of the shell companies, Milltown Corporate Services Ltd., which played a central role in the state’s purchase of two oil derricks for $785 million, or about double what they were said to be worth.

“This,” he said, “was an offshore used often by Mr. Yanukovych’s entourage.”

The role of the offshore companies in business dealings involving Mr. Manafort came to light because of court filings in the Cayman Islands and in a federal court in Virginia related to an investment fund, Pericles Emerging Markets. Mr. Manafort and several partners started the fund in 2007, and its major backer was Mr. Deripaska, the Russian mogul, to whom the State Department has refused to issue a visa, apparently because of allegations linking him to Russian organized crime, a charge he has denied.

Mr. Deripaska agreed to commit as much as $100 million to Pericles so it could buy assets in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, including a regional cable television and communications company called Black Sea Cable. But corporate records and court filings show that it was hardly a straightforward transaction.

The Black Sea Cable assets were controlled by a rotating cast of offshore companies that led back to the Yanukovych network, including, at various times, Milltown Corporate Services and two other companies well known to law enforcement officials, Monohold A.G. and Intrahold A.G. Those two companies won inflated contracts with a state-run agricultural company, and also acquired a business center in Kiev with a helicopter pad on the roof that would ease Mr. Yanukovych’s commute from his country estate to the presidential offices.

A Disputed Investment
Mr. Deripaska would later say he invested $18.9 million in Pericles in 2008 to complete the acquisition of Black Sea Cable. But the planned purchase — including the question of who ended up with the Black Sea assets — has since become the subject of a dispute between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort.

In 2014, Mr. Deripaska filed a legal action in a Cayman Islands court seeking to recover his investment in Pericles, which is now defunct. He also said he had paid about $7.3 million in management fees to the fund over two years. Mr. Deripaska did not respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Manafort’s lawyer, Mr. Hibey, disputed the account of the Black Sea Cable deal contained in Mr. Deripaska’s Cayman filings, and said the Russian oligarch had overseen details of the final transaction involving the acquisition. He denied that Mr. Manafort had received management fees from Pericles during its operation, but said that one of Mr. Manafort’s partners, Rick Gates, who is also working on the Trump campaign, had received a “nominal” sum.

Court papers indicate that Pericles’ only deal involved Black Sea Cable.

Mr. Manafort continued working in Ukraine after the demise of Mr. Yanukovych’s government, helping allies of the ousted president and others form a political bloc that opposed the new pro-Western administration. Some of his aides were in Ukraine as recently as this year, and Ukrainian company records give no indication that Mr. Manafort has formally dissolved the local branch of his company, Davis Manafort International, directed by a longtime assistant, Konstantin V. Kilimnik.

At Mr. Manafort’s old office on Sofiivska Street, new tenants said they had discovered several curiosities apparently left behind, including a knee X-ray signed by Mr. Yanukovych, possibly referring to tennis matches played between Mr. Manafort and Mr. Yanukovych, who had spoken publicly of a knee ailment affecting his game.

There was another item with Mr. Yanukovych’s autograph: a piece of white paper bearing a rough sketch of Independence Square, the site of the 2014 uprising that drove him from power."
210,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin,"For a brief moment, it seemed that the powerful adviser’s head might roll at the Castle. After he lost his long legal battle over a hefty state fine, the Czech president warned him to pay up or lose his post.

Then a guardian angel materialized from Moscow.

Lukoil, the largest private Russian oil company in an industry dependent on Kremlin approval, stepped in to pay the nearly $1.4 million fine owed to a Czech court.

The aide, Martin Nejedly, stayed on as economic adviser to the Czech president, Milos Zeman, and vice chairman of his party. Perhaps more important, he retained his office right next to the president’s in the Castle, the official palace that looms over the capital, Prague.

But the payment last spring raised questions about Russian influence-buying in the Castle, where Mr. Zeman has staked out a position as one of the Kremlin’s most ardent sympathizers among European leaders.

“Unfortunately in the Czech Republic, some advisers to the president or the prime minister are willing to cooperate with the Russians,” said Karel Randak, who retired as head of the Czech foreign intelligence service in 2007. “I am not saying that they are Russian agents — but unfortunately for some people, the money is more important than the security of the Czech Republic.”

On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia to retaliate against what American intelligence agencies say was the use of cyberattacks to meddle in the presidential election. But while the hacking focused attention on one particularly stealthy, intrusive way of influencing other states, it is just one lever that the Kremlin pulls.

The others include disinformation campaigns across a range of Russian-financed media outlets, support for violent fringe groups and even occasional plots against high-profile government critics.

And in some cases, experts say, the Kremlin and its allies resort to an old-fashioned but highly effective technique: trying to buy seats at the table of mainstream politics, never sure where or when their support might pay off.

One overarching question about Russian influence in Europe is whether President Vladimir V. Putin has just been lucky that some politicians echo his thinking, or whether the Kremlin has manipulated that trend. For many analysts, somewhere between pure luck and outright manipulation lies opportunism, and they call that a Kremlin specialty.

“The Russians systematically fill any open space, and they try to expand it,” said Martin Stropnicky, the Czech defense minister. “They have years of practice, and they are not in a hurry.”

Moscow did not construct public disenchantment with either the European Union or liberal immigration policies, for example, but it exploits such issues, analysts said. The Kremlin seeks to weaken what it considers alliances arrayed against it, like the European Union and NATO, especially as it sees them spreading through its natural sphere of influence in the former Soviet bloc.

“Every country that was successful in moving away from Communism toward an open, prosperous society based on law is a real threat to them,” said Ivan Gabal, deputy chairman of the Security Committee in the Czech Parliament.

Russia’s funding of political movements or individual politicians is nothing new, analysts say. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all manner of payments from Moscow came to light, including subsidizing of the antinuclear movement.

“The behavior is so close to Soviet behavior it is ridiculous,” said Martin Kragh, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm. “It is like they picked up an old handbook and just dusted it off.”

Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who served as a Kremlin spin doctor for 15 years before 2011, said the main difference now was that while the Soviet Union had sought out ideological allies, the modern Kremlin looked for anyone who could serve its purposes.

“I am certain that they pay a large number of different people,” he said. “In the Kremlin they see this as the normal ways of the market. I think that they always have some money, a line item in the budget, to help in creating advantageous positions.”

A Czech Leader’s Path Back
As prime minister from 1998 to 2002, Mr. Zeman was the key official in negotiating the Czech Republic’s entrance into the European Union, lauding it as his country’s return to its Western roots. Then he lost a presidential bid in 2003, withdrawing to a remote village and passing summer days floating in a rubber dinghy on a local lake.

Most Czechs forgot about him. The Russians did not.

He was invited to an annual forum used as a platform to attack Western institutions by Vladimir I. Yakunin, head of Russian Railways and a former Soviet intelligence officer at the United Nations. At least one Russian ambassador dropped in to visit as well, according to several Czech journalists.

Mr. Zeman made a comeback in 2013, winning the presidency in a victory partly engineered by Mr. Nejedly, the key financial official for the campaign.

Mr. Nejedly remains a shadowy figure — serving the president as a private adviser, not on the government payroll.

He spent most of the 1990s working in Russia, telling one Czech reporter in a rare interview that he promoted Opel cars. He eventually returned to the Czech Republic and in 2007 founded Lukoil Aviation Czech, a Lukoil subsidiary, becoming its general manager. The company won no-bid contracts to supply aviation fuel at several Czech airports, including Prague’s.

But the business failed, running up almost $7.5 million in debts, according to commercial records kept by the Prague Municipal Court, including a $1.4 million fine Mr. Nejedly owed to the Czech state over a fuel deal gone sour. The records were first unearthed in November by the MF DNES newspaper.

Lukoil liquidated its subsidiary. Court records indicate that Mr. Nejedly, who owned 40 percent of Lukoil Aviation Czech, paid nothing.

Fostering ties with energy middlemen who owe their fortunes to Russia and exert considerable political influence is a classic Russian method seen in Germany, Ukraine and other countries. Such links might not be forged by the Kremlin directly, but by individuals or companies seeking to please Mr. Putin.

Mr. Nejedly displays his Russian sympathies plainly enough — a recent picture published in the Czech media showed him holding his cellphone with a picture of Mr. Putin on the back.

Relations between Russia and the European Union deteriorated sharply in 2014 after Russian used its military to annex Crimea and to destabilize Ukraine. In the aftermath, Mr. Zeman proved notably friendly toward Russia.

He repeatedly criticized Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and denied that the Kremlin had deployed troops in Ukraine. The latter prompted Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister at the time, to remark in September of 2014: “I don’t know if the Czech Republic has an intelligence service. It does? Then he should ask them.”

Mr. Zeman was among just two or three European Union leaders who attended the May 2015 Victory Day parade in Moscow commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Mr. Putin greeted him warmly.

“It is a pleasure to know that there are politicians in Europe who are capable of directly expressing their viewpoint and of asserting and conducting an independent policy,” the Russian president said, according to the Kremlin’s website.

Mr. Nejedly, though lacking a Czech government security clearance, was one of just two aides in the meeting, a move Mr. Zeman defended because of Mr. Nejedy’s role as an economic adviser.

Since that time, Mr. Zeman has continued backing pro-Kremlin policies. He endorsed the Russian intervention in Syria, and last summer called for a “Czechxit” referendum like the British vote to withdraw from the European Union.

Debate Over Influence
There is a debate in the Czech Republic over the extent to which the Kremlin influences the president. Some accuse him of accepting Russian money for his campaigns, while others say his statements reflect the sentiments of a public increasingly fed up with the European Union. Then there are those who argue that he has long espoused a role for the Czech Republic as an East-West bridge.

Some observers also note that as president, Mr. Zeman has a loud megaphone but little real power. The prime minister and the cabinet, who set policy, have remained staunchly pro-Western.

The president’s spokesman, Jiri Ovcacek, said in a text message that he would not respond to questions about alleged Russian influence. Mr. Zeman tends to dismiss his critics, including the press, as “Prague whiners” or “Prague cafe society.”

Mr. Nejedly, reached by telephone, railed briefly about the court fine levied against Lukoil Aviation Czech, before asking to see any questions in writing. He did not answer them. The Russian Embassy also asked for questions in writing and did not respond. Lukoil’s Moscow headquarters said it had liquidated the company and paid off its debts in accordance with Czech law, noting that it had appealed the fine and lost.

Mr. Zeman previously denied that Lukoil was among his sponsors, and Vagit Alekperov, head of the company, told a Czech newspaper years ago that Lukoil was privately owned and entirely independent of Russian politics, according to translations from The Fleet Sheet, an English-language news service.

It is difficult to prove that the Kremlin buys influence. Even in the rare cases when the payments are obvious, cause and effect are not black and white. Various Czech politicians and analysts argued that President Zeman merely reflected the popular mood at home.

Zdenek Ondracek, a member of Parliament for the Communist Party, said many Czechs were nostalgic for the days before 1989, when the Soviet model offered greater stability, income equality and relative ease.

“The socialist state offered its citizens many guarantees, and no one would find themselves facing hardships on their own,” Mr. Ondracek said, wearing a black T-shirt printed with words “I was born in the CSSR,” the old initials for the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.

In some cases, old ties may be more potent than any website pumping out false stories, said Mr. Randak, the former intelligence chief. He noted that many such personal links existed from the more than four decades that the Soviet Union controlled Czechoslovakia.

Russian businesspeople, journalists and others have longstanding social or commercial ties here, and some undoubtedly work for Russian intelligence, he said.

The Russian Embassy also tried to recruit members of the 40,000-strong exile community as agents of influence, setting up the Coordinating Council of the Russian Compatriots in the Czech Republic, according to two Russian leaders of expatriate groups, Alexej N. Kelin, the coordinating council’s former head, and Igor Zolotarev. At first the exiles thought the embassy outreach was to learn how the Czech Republic transitioned away from Communism.

“This illusion disappeared at the time when Putin came to power and the whole interest of Russia in its citizens abroad was treating them as a channel to exercise Russian foreign policy abroad,” said Mr. Zolotarev, the founder of an expatriate group called Russian Tradition.

In addition, Prague is teeming with Russian spies. The 2015 annual report by the domestic intelligence service stated that the extraordinary number of Russian diplomats accredited to the embassy here meant many were working as intelligence officers. The number of Russian Embassy diplomats is generally pegged at 120 to 140, compared with about 40 Foreign Service officers for the United States.

Puppet organizations and other Russian operations “can be used to destabilize or manipulate Czech society or the political environment at any time, if Russia wishes to do so,” the report said.

In January, the Interior Ministry will start a Center Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats meant to expose disinformation and the like.

Analysts suspect the Kremlin is the main Russian entity that tries to buy influence, but hardly the only one. Oligarchs and companies are guilty of the same behavior.

“A lot of this is not at the direct behest of Putin,” said Alina Polyakova of the Atlantic Council, editor of a recent study on Russian influence in Europe. “There are individuals who try to seek favoritism, who want to bring something good to the czar.”"
211,NYT,Staff,2017,Russia Putin," To his neighbors in a village in western Hungary, 76-year-old Istvan Gyorkos was just an old man who mostly kept to himself. Hardly anyone looked askance at his passion for guns and for training youths in paramilitary tactics.

In late October, however, Mr. Gyorkos, a veteran neo-Nazi and the leader of a tiny fringe outfit called the Hungarian National Front, suddenly took on a more sinister visage when, according to Hungarian police officers who raided his home in search of illegal weapons, he shot and killed a member of the police team with an assault rifle. Members of his family say the dead policeman was shot by a fellow officer.

The saga then took an even stranger turn: Hungarian intelligence officials told a parliamentary committee in Budapest that Mr. Gyorkos had for years been under scrutiny for his role in a network of extremists linked to and encouraged by Russia. So close was the relationship, the committee heard, that Russian military intelligence officers, masquerading as diplomats, staged regular mock combat exercises using plastic guns with neo-Nazi activists near Mr. Gyorkos’s home.

That Russia, a nation intensely proud of its huge role in the defeat of Hitler’s Germany in World War II, would want anything to do with marginal, anti-Semitic crackpots who revere Hitler’s wartime allies in Hungary might, at first glance, seem beyond comprehension.

But Andras Racz, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said it fit into a scattershot strategy of placing small bets, directly or through proxies, on ready-made fringe groups in an effort to destabilize or simply disorient the European Union.

Most of these bets fail, but reaching out to those on the margins costs little and sometimes hits pay dirt. That happened with Jobbik, a once-marginal far-right Hungarian group that is now the country’s leading opposition party — and a big fan of President Vladimir V. Putin, as is Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban.

At a time when Russia’s relations with the West, or at least with established parties there, have soured dramatically over Syria, Ukraine and accusations of interference on all sides, Mr. Putin has enjoyed an extraordinary run of apparent good luck, as exemplified by the surprise election victory of Donald J. Trump, who has repeatedly voiced admiration for the Russian leader. Pro-Russia candidates won presidential elections recently in Bulgaria and Moldova, and France’s National Front, which received bank loans worth nearly $12 million from Russian banks, is now a serious contender for the French presidency next year.

Britain, which has generally taken a tough stance on Russia and its meddling abroad, has turned in on itself amid rancorous internal struggles over how to leave the European Union after a referendum in June.

Even in Estonia, a Baltic nation deeply suspicious of Moscow, a party long reviled as a Russian tool recently took charge of a new government.

Each country has its own particular and often very local reasons for its Russia-friendly turn. Mr. Putin did not engineer the shift single-handedly, but he has been adept at making his own luck, deploying Orthodox priests, Russian-funded news media outlets like RT, spies and computer hackers to ride and help create the wave of populist anger now battering the foundations of the post-1945 European order.

Mr. Gyorkos, one of the foot soldiers in that assault, is now in jail but, according to his lawyer, has not yet been formally charged. A few days before he was accused of opening fire on police officers, a court in the southern Norwegian town of Tonsberg ordered the detention of Jan Petrovsky, a longtime local resident of Russian nationality who, according to a confidential 19-page report by Norway’s security service, belonged to “a network of people characterized by abnormal interest in weapons” and a “shared enmity towards Norwegian democracy and other democracies.”

Mr. Petrovsky, the report said, posed a “threat to fundamental national interests” because of his involvement with far-right extremists in Norway, his trips to eastern Ukraine to fight alongside Russian-backed separatists and his efforts to recruit Scandinavians to the pro-Russian cause.

There is no evidence that Mr. Petrovsky, 29, acted on instructions from the Russian state. He instead served a murky Russian nationalist movement that, under Mr. Putin, has provided muscle for Kremlin-backed operations to subvert government control in eastern Ukraine and, more recently, in the Balkan nation of Montenegro.

After his detention in Norway, the immigration authorities stripped him of his residency permit and sent him back to Russia. Mr. Petrovsky, now in St. Petersburg helping nationalists there train for combat, declined to be interviewed. His Oslo lawyer, Nils Christian Nordhus, dismissed Norway’s assessment as untrue and said his client would appeal the revocation of his Norwegian visa and permanent-residency status.

Lorant Gyori, an analyst with Political Capital, a research group in Budapest that has studied Russia’s outreach to extremist groups, said Russian methods today mimicked those of the Soviet era, when the K.G.B. had a department dedicated to “active measures.” These went beyond merely collecting intelligence and included disinformation and subversion, often involving various front organizations and Moscow-funded fringe parties that worked to shape, not just spy on, events in foreign countries.

This department, Section A of the K.G.B.’s First Chief Directorate, survived the collapse of Communism and now operates as part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, known as the S.V.R. Russian military intelligence, the G.R.U., has its own teams expert in subversion, disinformation and other tools of hybrid warfare.

Casting a Wide Net
Russia has spread its net wide, reaching out to mainstream parties and politicians — like former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany, who was given a lucrative job by Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom energy giant — while also targeting figures widely dismissed as kooks.

Others, like Hungary’s prime minister, Mr. Orban, have been attracted by Mr. Putin’s hostility toward liberal democracy and Russia’s readiness to hand out cash, like a $10 billion loan to Hungary to pay for the construction by Russia of a nuclear power plant.

While polls show that public opinion in Hungary remains far more favorable to the West than to Russia, which crushed uprisings there in 1848 and 1956, Mr. Orban and the leader of Jobbik have both ditched their previous hostility toward Moscow and focused their fire on the West instead, particularly the European Union.

The turnaround by Jobbik has been particularly spectacular and is linked to the role of Bela Kovacs, an enigmatic Hungarian businessman who worked for years in Russia. He joined the far-right party when it was still a struggling band of marginal nationalists in 2005; provided it with funds to stave off bankruptcy, ostensibly out of his own pocket; and took charge of its foreign relations. Mr. Kovacs, now a member of the European Parliament, has been under investigation by Hungarian prosecutors since 2014 over suspicions that he and his Russian-born wife have been recruited as Russian agents.

Widely mocked as KGBela, the businessman has denied any links to Russian intelligence but has never explained big gaps in his biography, which include long periods when he disappeared in Russia. Also unexplained is why he gave Jobbik money and where it came from.

The European Parliament last year lifted his immunity so the investigation could proceed, but the authorities in Hungary have so far shown little real interest in pursuing the matter.

The government has shown similar reluctance to probe too deeply into Russia’s links to Mr. Gyorkos, the neo-Nazi in Bony. Those connections were revealed in October by Index, a well-regarded opposition news media outlet, and were then confirmed and expanded upon by security officials who briefed the parliamentary security committee, members of the committee said.

Mr. Gyorkos, the committee was told, had such close relations with Russians acting under diplomatic cover at the embassy in Budapest that they traveled to his remote village as many as five times a year to join his supporters for games of airsoft, a form of mock combat that involves the firing of plastic pellets with replica guns. The Russian Embassy in Budapest did not respond to a request for comment.

Zsolt Molnar, the head of the security committee, said that the diplomats were believed to be members of Russia’s G.R.U. military intelligence agency, and that the games were a form of military training.

“It was all entirely legal,” Mr. Molnar said. “There was no problem, and this is precisely the problem.” He expressed dismay at how easily and openly supposed Russian diplomats had cultivated ties with violent and disruptive elements on Hungary’s political fringe.

Bernadett Szel, a legislator from Hungary’s small green party and a member of the security committee, said she had this month proposed a full-scale parliamentary investigation into Russian meddling in Hungary but the move was blocked by Mr. Orban’s governing party, Fidesz. Members of the security committee from Fidesz declined to comment.

Kolas Gyorkos, the arrested man’s son, who is a gunsmith, said he had not participated in the exercises, organized by his father for followers, and did not know if any Russians had taken part. He denied that his father was a neo-Nazi, saying he was simply a Hungarist, a reference to a Hungarian fascist party set up in the 1930s with much the same ideology as the Nazis.

The mock military games, which peaked between 2010 and 2012, seem to have been merely a prelude to what security officials believe was Russia’s primary goal: taking control of a far-right website, Hidfo, or the Bridgehead, that Mr. Gyorkos’s group had set up, and turning it into a platform for Russian disinformation.

The website, Hidfo.net, began as a bulletin board for rants by members of the Hungarian National Front and other extremist groups but has since switched its server to Russia — it is now Hidfo.ru — and serves as a portal for more sober but heavily slanted articles on military and geopolitical affairs with a decidedly pro-Russian tilt.

It is also an outlet for fake news, including an invented report in 2014 that Hungary was sending tanks to Ukraine, which set off a diplomatic incident. Recent reports, all false, asserted that the United States Department of Homeland Security had declared the November presidential election free of any cyberattack; that Austria wanted to lift sanctions against Russia; and that NATO’s secretary general had pledged to make European nations vassals of Washington. A special section offered a Russian expert’s opinions on how the United States and its allies use hybrid warfare to undermine their rivals around the world.

Efforts in Scandinavia
Russian efforts to disrupt the normal functioning of democracy have also been on display in Scandinavia. There, an extremist and avowedly revolutionary outfit called Nordic Resistance has formed a curious alliance with the Russian Imperial Movement, a far-right group that, while not sponsored by the Russian state, has helped the Kremlin by recruiting Russian fighters for the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

The Russian group announced last year that it had given an unspecified “monetary sum” to Nordic Resistance, but the Russian group’s leader, Stanislav Vorobyov, said in a recent interview that this amounted to just 150 euros.

His group has nonetheless played a prominent role in rallying extremists from Europe and the United States into a common front against what they see as a globalized elite out of touch with their people and traditional values. It joined a Russian political party, Rodina, in organizing a conference in March 2015 in St. Petersburg that was attended by white supremacists from the United States like Jared Taylor and many of Europe’s most prominent far-right figures. Mr. Petrovsky, the Russian recently expelled from Norway, also attended.

Thor Bach, a Norwegian youth worker who has followed far-right extremism in Norway for decades, said the influx of new blood, ideas and possibly even money from Russia had helped revive what had until recently, at least in Norway, been a moribund cause.

“The neo-Nazi scene here was dead, but it has had a reawakening this year,” he said. “Someone in Russia thinks it is a good idea to support neo-Nazis in Scandinavia.”

He said that there was no evidence of direct support by the Russian state but that there had clearly been an intermingling of Russian and Scandinavian extremists who all see Mr. Putin as a standard-bearer for muscular nationalism. “All the loonies are gathering under the banner of Putin, and now also Trump,” he said."
