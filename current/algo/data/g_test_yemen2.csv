pul,"Just six months ago, Polish workers took the measure of their misery and decided to act. The revolt they started in the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk has gathered momentum, broadened and matured. Developing outlines of an ideology, it has turned into a movement and, some would insist, into a revolutionary force.

The question is whether the changes unleashed can be contained within political structures originally imposed by Stalin and still essentially a mirror image of the Soviet system. Will the Kremlin, which has based its security on maintaining such systems as a protective zone against the West, allow the ''Polish experiment'' to continue?

Already, structures have changed. Universities have gained partial autonomy. The press is struggling to escape censorship and there are union-written and edited newspapers. The writers' council and the journalists' association -institutions intended to reinforce party control - are under independent management.

Last week, the party appointed the Minister of Defense, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, as Prime Minister, breaching party doctrine that the military should be subordinate. Now the Politburo is contemplating the biggest reform of all -limiting party officials' terms of office and choosing them in secret elections with an open nominating procedure and more candidates than positions. Such a change could mean that all but a handful of the 140 Central Committee members would lose their jobs.

Such changes do not come easily. The leadership resists at almost every turn, but the Solidarity union is always there, insisting that the Gdansk agreements be honored, in spirit and letter. What Western editorial writers fail to understand when they write that ''Solidarity is going too far'' - by demanding a five-day work week or by agitating for removal of local officials - is that the union is not really a union at all. It is not a hierarchical, cohesive organization concerned with collective bargaining. It is a mass movement, a scarcely believable assembly of Polish nationalists, blacklisted writers, fed-up mechanics, establishment journalists, honest Communists, disgruntled farmers, alienated miners, student activists and angry housewives.

Solidarity has no alternative to waging political battle on behalf of all disaffected groups. Because the movement is amorphous and represents hope for improvement in the status quo, it has managed to unite industrial workers and farmers, who have traditionally been opposed, and workers and intellectuals, who rarely have been in contact. It cuts across all strata and all ages.

Solidarity is fighting for greater budget allocations for hospitals and housing and for a greater voice for workers in government. It is also battling against corrupt accumulation of wealth and party privileges, demanding fairer distribution of Poland's limited resources. ''We can all live on one crust of bread as long as we all get the same amount'' is a favorite rallying cry of Lech Walesa, Solidarity's leader.

Issues igniting strikes and strike threats recently were of a different caliber than before. In Bielsko-Biala, local officials had evicted workers from apartments and used funds for luxury housing. In Jelenia Gora, the issue was an exclusive rest home for Ministry of the Interior officials. In Katowice, it was the Government's assumption that miners should work fewer hours than other industry employees. Solidarity also has insisted that workers getting the lowest pay should get the largest raises. And the union is campaigning against inequities concealed in falsified Government reports. Recently, for example, it was disclosed that three million children were growing up in poverty and that more than two-thirds of old-age pensioners were living ''below the breadline.''

Touching the Revenge Nerve

This role puts Solidarity at odds with the Soviet Union, where special privileges for party members are a given. It adds something resembling a New Class struggle - workers against the party. When Mieczyslaw Jagielski, the Deputy Prime Minister, arrived to negotiate the Gdansk agreement and nervously eyed the strikers standing with locked arms, one shouted, ''Look straight into the eyes of a worker.''

Mr. Walesa, with an unerring instinct for issues that move bluecollar people, plays upon their sense of class revenge. Two weeks ago, surrounded by television cameras, he visited Arlamowo, the exclusive boar-shooting reserve in southeastern Poland, where Edward Gierek, the ousted party leader, had entertained in grand style. Rattling the gates, Mr. Walesa unsuccessfully demanded entry to see ''how the rich people live.'' The incident was not shown on Polish television, but the word spread and last week, the Prime Minister cut the preserve's size by two-thirds.

The party has little to offer to counteract this idealistic fervor. Long ago, it seems to have stopped believing in the righteousness of Marxism-Leninism; ideology is not even preached anymore.

Communist leaders are obsessed by their minority position. (One Central Committee member confided that, in honest elections, an overwhelming victory would go to a party of Christian Democrats.) They are quick to spot anti-Communist conspiracies, even where they do not exist. Workers have taken great pains to try to assure them that their unions are not anti-socialist and accept the realities of political geography. But the leaders seem not to listen.

The Party's Restless Rank and File

To most Poles, socialism is something that came in on the coattails of the Soviet Red Army, but they are not implacably opposed to it. Several generations have grown up accustomed to the personal security and relaxed work rhythm socialism affords. But socialism is not taken seriously as an ideology that conforms to the national spirit. Although some people in the workers' movement advocate moving gradually toward party pluralism, or greater play for private ownership, in essence the movement is for more liberty and democracy under socialism, not for jettisoning the system.

It cannot be denied, though, that the movement is against the party, and the Soviet Union construes the erosion of party authority as counterrevolution, pure and simple. Many union leaders are deeply aware of the danger of Soviet intervention, but they press on, convinced the rewards outweigh the risks.

Besides the demands by Solidarity, farmers and students, party leaders must deal with a groundswell of revolt among their own three million members. The leadership cannot fix a firm date for an extraordinary party congress, expected in the spring, for fear the rank and file will overturn the leadership and search for a Polish Alexander Dubcek. It has retreated into empty denunciations and threats, lashing out at ''anti-socialist'' dissidents, but making no move to arrest them. It also demands the ouster of its own appointed local officials and does oust them.

Being seen to back down from each challenge is less important, some theorize, than taking the position in the first place. The intent is not to show Moscow that the party is in control, but to show it is still pure, at least at the uppermost level. Recently, for example, a Warsaw cabaret featured a blatantly anti-Soviet and anti-Marxist performance, even featuring a little revolving birdcage with a tiny Lenin doll inside. The authorities promptly forbade the cabaret to open; censors condemned the entire show - and then let it play every night. ''The important thing is to make noise about it, '' said a well-connected establishment journalist."
pul,"Lebanese Christian militiamen massacred scores of Palestinian men, women and children in a refugee camp on the southern edge of west Beirut Friday night, according to witnesses and reporters who visited the camp.

[In Washington, a senior State Department official said the United States has received reliable reports from witnesses that at least 300 people had been slain in two refugee camps, Shatila and Sabra. The official added that the death toll would probably go higher.]

Residents of the Shatila camp said no Israeli soldiers were directly involved in the killings. The residents said the Israelis sealed off the area surrounding the Shatila camp and the nearby Sabra camp Friday and then permitted Christian militiamen from the army of Maj. Saad Haddad, which is armed and trained by Israel, and the Phalangist militia of the late President-elect Bashir Gemayel to move into the camp. Major Haddad's forces had been brought to the area by the Israeli Army.

A spokesman for the Phalangists categorically denied that any members of the Lebanese Forces, the name of the Phalangist militia, had been involved in the killings in Shatila.

Walking down the rubble-strewn streets of Shatila this morning reporters found two old men shot through the head, several piles of women and children, their bodies covered with flies, and at least one line of middle-aged men who had been lined up against a cinder-block wall and executed. A Count of 40 Bodies

Reporters counted at least 40 bodies, roughly a third of whom were women, children and elderly men. (In Washington, a senior State Department official said the United States had received reliable reports from witnesses that at least 300 people had been slain at the Shatila and Sabra camps. The official added that the death toll would probably go higher.)

It was impossible for a reporter who was not in the camp when the killings took place to determine with any certainty whether the Christian militiamen had acted on orders of the Israeli Army or whether they had gone on a killing spree without the knowledge of the Israeli command.

(In Jerusalem, Israeli officials deplored the slayings and said that Israeli troops had intervened, at one point with force, to prevent the Phalangists from killing more people.)

Witnesses said the killings began at about 6 o'clock Friday night and shots could be heard all over the area. It was impossible to determine just how much resistance had been put up by the camp residents, many of whom had only recently returned to their homes after the pullout of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Judging from the numbers of women and even babies whose bloated, decaying bodies were strewn about, and the number of people who appeared to have been shot at close range through the head - some of the men had been lined up and shot - their deaths were clearly not the outcome of a firefight but rather premeditated acts.

''It was a massacre,'' said former Prime Minister Saab Salaam, whose house was ringed this morning by family members of people missing from the camp, ''a real massacre.''

''This is precisely why we wanted the multinational peacekeeping force to stay on and precisely why we asked and received assurances from the United States that the Israelis would not enter west Beirut,'' Mr. Salaam said.

The first contingent of Israeli ground troops and Israeli-made Merkava tanks began to enter the Shatila camp, a warren of cinderblock huts with corrugated roofs and makeshift plumbing where 15,000 Palestinian refugees once lived, at 2:15 P.M. today.

Despite the eerie silence that hung over the camp, the Israeli commandos crouched low as they ran from building to building. The Israelis apparently had the Christian militiamen enter the camp Friday night and do the most dangerous house-to-house searches to minimize their own casualties. It was not immediately known what the reaction was of the first Israeli soldiers when they entered the camp and came upon the heaps of dead civilians.

Nearby the Israelis continued their roundup of suspected Palestinian guerrillas. Israeli troops armed with loudspeakers drove through the Sabra refugee camp and the Fakhani Palestinian quarter and ordered all men to go to the sports stadium with their identification papers for interrogation.

By late afternoon 500 to 600 men were huddled together under several tiers of the stadium awaiting questioning. The men were being provided with food and water, and anyone in need of medical attention was being treated. The wives and sisters of many of those inside stood behind a fence begging reporters, kissing them up and down the arm, if they would only go in and find out about the fate of their husbands, sons or brothers.

The Israeli commander in charge, Col. Naftali Bahiry, said the identification papers of each man would be checked to determine whether or not he was a Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla who had been ordered to take off his uniform and stay behind in civilian clothes in violation of the withdrawal agreement. The Begin Government says there are some 2,000 such guerrillas still in the camp. Most Are Not P.L.O. Guerrillas

Colonel Bahiry conceded that most of those being detained by the Israelis after questioning were not P.L.O. guerrillas ordered to stay behind, since few of those were apparently being found. Rather they were members of the Palestinian militia, which is made up of older men or school boys and was in charge of providing law and order in the camps.

Those who belonged to the militia are known as Lebanese Palestinians - the Palestinians who have lived in Beirut since 1948 and who unlike the guerrillas did not come here to fight. The militiamen are for the most part students, workers or businessmen who fight only when called upon to protect the camps.

Asked if all the Palestinian fighters being found by the Israelis were simply local militiamen rather than guerrillas ordered to stay behind by Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, as the Begin Government claimed, Colonel Bahiry stated, ''Oh, much more than half are militiamen.''

As the Palestinian men trudged to the sports stadium for interrogation, many asked reporters if any Phalangists or Haddad men were there, as they had heard of the killings in Shatila. One woman, Badria Muhaid, said she had her father and three brothers inside the sports stadium with the Israelis, but her 15-year-old brother, Marwan, had been taken away Friday night from the Sabra refugee camp by the Phalangists working together with the Israelis. Interrogated by Haddad's Militia

Colonel Bahiry declared the Haddad men and the Phalangists had been ordered out of the area this morning -but it appears to have been a little too late for the residents of Shatila.

According to residents of Shatila and reporters who visited the main street of the camp Friday evening, things were relatively calm in the area. One young boy, who declined to identify himself, said all the men were ordered out of the camp Friday and were divided up near the sports stadium between Lebanese and Palestinians. They were interrogated by members of Major Haddad's militia, which was transported into Beirut by the Israeli Army. Some of the men, he charged, were cut across the cheek when they refused to cooperate in the interrogation.

The Christian militiamen also stormed the Palestinian Akka Hospital, from which the International Committee of the Red Cross was trying to remove some of the wounded patients. Reliable Western medical sources who were at the hospital said a Palestinian nurse was repeatedly raped and shot dead by Christian militiamen, and several doctors from the hospital were taken off.

A Red Cross spokesman later said, ''Injured people were killed in their hospital beds, others were kidnapped.'' Bodies Frozen in Grotesque Forms

According to residents of the Shatila camp interviewed today, all of whom refused to give their names for fear of reprisal, Christian militiamen entered the camp between 6 and 7 Friday night and began rounding people up, moving from house to house.

Some people were taken away, some were killed on the spot, some managed to flee and others to hide. Why some were killed and others were taken off was not clear. Many buildings that reporters saw standing Friday at 5 P.M. had either been dynamited or bulldozed today.

The scene on the main street of the camp was horrific as both reporters and residents were gagging as they walked down the street from the stench of the bodies that were frozen in all manner of grotesque forms, their skin pale like manikins. Some were simply heaped in piles with garbage, others were trapped under rubble while still more simply lay on the street where they were gunned down.

The bodies of two old men, one clad in blue-striped pajamas, were sprawled on the side of the road. Neighbors said the man in the pajamas was Hada Nouri, 90 years old. He appeared to have been shot through the head. Nearby, crumpled up at the entrance of an alley, was the body of 70-year-old Abu Derani. Accurate Count Is Difficult

Brass shell cases littered the street, testimony to the fighting that had taken place Friday night. At one cinder-block house, what appeared to be an entire family had been gunned down. A matronly looking old Arab woman had a bullet through her chest. Laying in a pile next to her were young children and a middle-aged man. Just around the corner at cinder-block houses labeled No. 424 and 422 the bodies of eight middle-aged men lay twisted together in a neat line against the wall.

Elsewhere, one could find women with their heads blown apart and others rotting together with the garbage surrounded by flies. A Norwegian diplomat, Gunnar Flakstad, said he saw a pile of bodies being taken off in a scoop bulldozer, apparently destined for burial. In the middle of the camp, near some of the worst bodies, was a freshly dug hole covered with red dirt and patted down by a bulldozer. The site is believed to be a mass grave.

It was impossible to tell how many more bodies beyond the 40 counted by reporters were still under the tumbled homes, how many might have already been buried or taken off or were in other areas of the camp not visited by this reporter. Other reliable sources who saw more of the camp said they counted as many as 80 corpses. It will be days before any final accurate count can be established.

''You must see it,'' said one member of the International Committee of the Red Cross. ''The world must know what has happened here.''"
pul,"The Israeli invasion of Lebanon did more than simply devastate the Palestine Liberation Organization militarily. It turned Lebanese politics upside down, tipping the balance of power radically in favor of the Maronite Christian minority and leaving the Moslem majority submissive and disillusioned.

In many ways the events of last summer constituted Lebanon's third civil war since independence, with a predominantly Christian portion of the population either passively welcoming or openly cooperating with the Israelis during the invasion, and a predominantly Moslem segment putting up whatever resistance it could muster.

Unlike previous civil wars in Lebanon, however, this one did not end with the traditional formula of ''no victor, no vanquished.'' The Israelis did not come to Lebanon to supervise a stalemate. Rather, there was a very clear victor, the Christians, as represented by the Phalangist militia and party, and a very clear vanquished, the Moslem left, as represented by the coalition known as the National Movement, which had bet its all on Syria and the P.L.O.

A New Era in Lebanese Politics

The victors, led by President Amin Gemayel, are now reshaping Lebanon in their own image, an image that many Lebanese of all religious beliefs now find attractive. In doing so they are opening a new era in Lebanese politics. It is expected to be an era in which Lebanon will no longer be considered a metaphor for all that is untamed in the Middle East, a haven for radicals, a hotbed of Arab nationalism and a country where even the poor can afford to defy the Government.

Rather it is expected to be an unabashedly pro-American era, aloof from the currents of Arab nationalism and governed by a conservative alliance dominated by Maronite Christians but also including Moslem privileged classes.

''The Che Guevara era of Lebanese politics is over,'' said Ghassan Tueni, Lebanon's former delegate to the United Nations. ''People here have had their fling with radicalism. Beards and jeans are out now. Neckties are in.''

''Lebanon is being put together anew,'' said Kamal Salibi, the country's leading historian. ''We still don't know yet exactly what is going to emerge. All that we can be certain of is that it will be distinctly different from what went before. If I were writing the history of this period I would say it is the end of one story and the beginning of another.''

The signs of the times abound. Posters of Amin Gemayel and his assassinated brother, Bashir, are now prominently displayed in Moslem West Beirut, sometimes plastered over the faded portrait of a Palestinian guerrilla or some other ''martyr'' of someone else's revolution. Sandblasters were busy recently erasing pro-Libyan and pro-Syrian slogans that had been spray-painted on walls around town in a graphic gesture of disdain that none would have dared undertake less than two months ago.

A Sweep of West Beirut

The new era of Lebanese politics was readily apparent in the way the army has been used by President Gemayel to round up ''illegal aliens'' and disarm the local population in West Beirut, without being ordered to undertake a similar sweep in the eastern half of the capital, where the Phalangist militia still holds sway.

People in West Beirut still talk about Oct. 5, the day the army came down from East Beirut into the heart of West Beirut like a tidal wave, leaving no doubt as to who was now in charge.

The operation was greeted with passivity by the local Moslem population -a passivity that resulted from changes in attitude and distribution of power that occurred among Lebanese Moslems after the Israeli invasion, which began June 6.

When the Israelis pulled out of Beirut, they left behind a major change in the political environment of the capital. They left one side, the Christians of East Beirut, with their heavy weapons and the other side, the Moslems of West Beirut, without them. Thus for the first time in Lebanon's history, the Maronite Christians represented by the Phalangists were able to dictate who the President would be without ever really going through the traditional negotiating process with the Sunni Moslem establishment of West Beirut.

'The Vanquished Are Tired'

''The vanquished are tired,'' said Adnan Iskandar, the chairman of the department of political studies at the American University of Beirut, ''and the means to resist at their disposal are practically nil.''

But the Moslems of West Beirut are not only tired, they are disillusioned as well. Since the 1975-76 civil war and the division of Beirut into two sectors, the 500,000 residents of West Beirut were ruled over by the National Movement, the coalition of leftist Moslem militias and Palestinian guerrilla groups.

It was a disparate group consisting of Communists wearing Ted Lapidus suits and Cartier watches; feudal Druse warlords who called themselves socialists, and petty gangsters who proclaimed different interpretations of Nasserite ideology. Their aim was to govern West Beirut, but through their constant squabbling they turned it into a cement jungle.

When the war came they could not defend the city against the Israeli onslaught while the Arab governments that financed them provided meager support. Once the P.L.O., the real backbone and only disciplined element in the movement, was forced to leave Beirut in a hurry, the coalition broke apart. Most people here greeted this with a sigh of relief, because the coalition's anarchy and ideological bombardments had become unbearable. 'A Very Bad Bet'

''We bet on the Arabs, and it turned out to be a very bad bet,'' said Sabah al-Haj, chairman of the Saudi Lebanese Bank Ltd. in West Beirut and a leading Shiite Moslem. ''Sometimes taking a beating once in a while is healthy. It brings you back to your senses.''

Although the Moslems in West Beirut will never be fully comfortable with President Gemayel as long as the Phalangist militia continues to exist in his shadow, the general attitude seems to be that for now it is better to try to get on his bandwagon and help steer rather than block the path.

''We are realistic,'' Mr. al-Haj said. ''He who is vanquished has to cede something to the victor. So what if we have a little less political clout? Which is more important: to have a Moslem at the head of the Government intelligence service or have a healthy, prosperous and secure country? I will take the last three, and Amin can have the other one.''

The new balance of power created in Lebanon over the summer was not only between Moslems and Christians but also between the economic ''haves'' and ''have-nots.''

Beirut's 'Misery Belt'

As a result of the civil war and constant fighting along the border with Israel, many poor villagers, most of them Shiite Moslems, fled their homes in southern Lebanon or in East Beirut to seek shelter in the western half of the capital.

They built cinderblock shacks and shops on empty private lots or Government land on the southern edge of the city, which came to be known as the ''misery belt.'' These shantytowns consisted of honeycombs of makeshift houses, whose residents provided cheap labor for local industry and were more or less protected by the P.L.O. and the leftist Moslem militias.

Although they were illegal and an eyesore, these shack cities provided the only real low-cost housing in Beirut for thousands of people.

Those days are over. One of the first acts of the new Government after it regained control over West Beirut was to order army bulldozers into these shantytowns to flatten them as part of a ''beautification'' program.

Homes and shops were systematically crushed into dusty mounds of bricks and twisted steel reinforcement rods, as though a tornado had swept over them. Resistance, sometimes violent, by the residents forced the army to halt its operation temporarily, but officers left word with local residents when they withdrew that they would be back to finish the job in the near future.

The symbolism of the action was not lost on people here. There is a joke making the rounds now, said Mr. Salibi, the historian, that in the new Lebanon ''it is going to be against the law to be poor.''

Double Standard Is Charged

No one disputes that the homes were built illegally. But many note bitterly that the ports in East Beirut run by the Phalangists are also illegal but that the video sets, French suits, liquor and other luxury items they import seem to rate a higher priority from the new Government.

''At a time when the biggest problem in the country is shelter after the war, the Government is tearing down people's homes and not even providing them with a tent,'' complained Abdul Rahman al-Labban, a Sunni Moslem and former Minister of Labor.

A few people with nowhere else to go still live among the largely deserted huts just north of the runway of Beirut International Airport.

''We came here from East Beirut during the civil war,'' explained Ali Halloum, a 50-year-old Shiite Moslem father of 10. ''When we arrived it was all sand dunes, like Kuwait. But it belongs to some rich man, and now he wants it back. I say: 'O.K., it's your land, but there is an Armenian living in my house in East Beirut. Give me my house back and I will give you this one.' I am telling you, either they give me somewhere else to live or I die with my house.''

As he spoke, other people poured out of their houses nearby and joined in a cacophony of complaints. Phrases like ''Would they ever do such a thing in the United States?'' or ''At least give me a tent'' or ''Where can I afford to live now?'' were repeated over and over.

If their grievances are not eventually addressed they will represent an explosive problem for the new Government.

Chances for National Reunification

The Israeli invasion of Lebanon did more than simply restructure the internal political and economic equations. Ironically, it also created new opportunities for national reunification.

Ever since the 1975-76 civil war and partition of Beirut, the traditional Sunni Moslem oligarchs were never really free to communicate openly with their Christian counterparts on the east side of the Green Line.

The meddling of the Syrians and the Palestinians in Lebanese politics and their support for the leftist Moslem militias that opposed rapprochement with Christians along traditional lines made it difficult for men like former Prime Ministers Saeb Salam and Takieddin Solh to speak their minds freely and explore possibilities for entente.

'Ruling Elites Can Meet and Mix'

The same was true for institutions. Even the staunchly independent and pro-unity newspaper An Nahar found that it had to practice a degree of self-censorship to survive.

''While it is true the Syrians and Palestinians are still in Lebanon,'' said Nawaf Salam, a Harvard-trained political scientist, ''the important thing is that they have been removed from the capital. It is here in Beirut where the ruling elites can meet and mix, and with the withdrawal of the Syrians and the P.L.O. and the eclipse of the Moslem militias, they now feel free to do so.''

Whether this will actually lead to a formal entente is another question. Although the P.L.O. and the Syrians hardly tried to foster rapprochement between Lebanese Moslems and Christians, they were by no means the root cause of the religious groups' historical differences. Still, the result of the Israeli invasion has been to give the Lebanese a little more room to explore root causes together. The sense of liberation from what seemed to be a hopeless past is palpable.

''People no longer feel trapped and manipulated,'' a well-known newspaper publisher said. ''For the past seven years my office has been bugged by the Syrians,'' he said, adding: ''I always had to go for a walk. Now people are suddenly coming to see me again.''

The Comeback of Saeb Salam

The best indication that West Beirut's Moslems are anxious to mend fences is the re-emergence of Saeb Salam as the political boss of West Beirut. One of the founding fathers of Lebanon who helped forge the national covenant with the Christians in 1943, Mr. Salam had fallen into political obscurity in the years after the civil war. He had lost control of the street to the Syrian and P.L.O.-supported leftist militias and the Nasserite gangs.

But as these groups began to crumble Mr. Salam made a comeback. People flocked to his home for safety during the war, sought his advice and intercession with the powers that be and encouraged him to speak for the Moslems in negotiations with the Phalangists and to fill the political vacuum in West Beirut.

''You could see grass growing at Saeb Salam's doorstep over the past few years,'' said Mr. Tueni, the former United Nations delegate. ''But he never abandoned his positions and his continuity with the past. People are now coming back to this figure of the old Lebanon. He is the uncrowned king of West Beirut.''

This desire for reunification was also apparent after the massacre of Palestinian civilians by Phalangist militiamen at the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in Beirut from Sept. 16 to 18. Although the Moslem leaders expressed their official regrets and ritual condemnation, neither they nor most people in the street were the least bit moved by the mass killing, and they have joined with the Christians in hushing up the affair.

No one seemed to want, as one Lebanese broadcasting official put it coldly, to permit the massacre to ''pollute our politics.'' One well-known Moslem leader in West Beirut said after the killings, ''In the choice between finding the Phalangist guilty and preserving hopes for national unity, I will take national unity.''

If there is any commonly expressed concern heard in Beirut these days it is that in the rush to return to normalcy and law and order, the central Government could become as authoritarian as its predecessors were helpless.

''We have to make sure that we make up for past mistakes without going too far, like towards dictatorship,'' a senior official in Lebanon's broadcasting industry said. ''The problem for us is how to stop being an Arab Cuba without turning ourselves into a banana republic.''

Nonetheless, if the Government were to err on the side of heavy-handedness there are more than a few people who would not complain. After eight years of living in a Hobbesian ''state of nature,'' at least some Lebanese have tired of the anything-goes spirit of old.

The other day on a busy street just off Hamra Street, the main thoroughfare in West Beirut, a man double-parked, holding up a lane of traffic. People immediately began honking at him and a small crowd gathered, shouting, ''The era of chaos is over!'' and ''Such things are not allowed anymore!'' He sheepishly moved his truck.

''I would not defend it if the Government got a little carried away,'' a 28-year-old Christian Maronite woman said, ''but this place could use a touch of dictatorship. My mother was kidnapped twice during the past seven years. There was no one around to stop them and no one to turn to for help. If we want real security we are going to have to pay a price for it.''

Before Lebanon can think of becoming either a full-fledged democracy or a full-fledged dictatorship, it is going to first have to become an independent state. For the time being, all that President Gemayel really rules over is the presidential palace grounds in Baabda, West Beirut and the airport. He has another 4,000 square miles to go.

The Phalangist militia still effectively controls East Beirut and the mountain enclave to the northeast. The Israeli Army still holds southern Lebanon and the Shouf mountains, and the Syrians and the P.L.O. still run things in northern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that uprooting the foreign forces and private armies that hold slices of Lebanon is going to be much more difficult and time-consuming than people here had hoped. The danger is that the longer it takes, the more momentum and credibility the new Government loses.

The biggest problem of all may turn out to be the withdrawal of the remaining 6,000 to 7,000 P.L.O. guerrillas. The Palestinians in Lebanon have been traumatized by the Beirut massacre, and its long-term impact is going to make the withdrawal of the P.L.O. from the rest of Lebanon doubly difficult.

The Israelis are demanding not only that the Syrians and the P.L.O. leave Lebanon but also that the Beirut Government sign a security pact with them and agree to ''normalize relations.'' The question of normalization will be very touchy for President Gemayel because Lebanese are not only frightened about competition from the Israeli economy but also fearful that any substantive normalization could damage Lebanon's ties with the rest of the Arab world.

In a sense the Israeli victory in Lebanon will ultimately be measured by the amount of peace it can wring out of the Lebanese Government, while Mr. Gemayel's success as President of all of Lebanon will depend on how little he can manage to give up to Israel.

The Future of the Phalangist Militia

Even if all foreign forces do eventually pull out - a very big if - what then is to become of the Phalangist militia and the mini-state, with its ports, taxes and institutions, built up over the last seven years in East Beirut?

To a large extent the raison d'etre for the establishment of the Phalangist militia - the presence of a P.L.O. state within a state in Lebanon - has been removed. In conversations with Phalangists one senses that there is a bit of confusion now as to precisely what to do next, which is not surprising given the fact that they have been mobilized since the early 1970's in pursuit of a single objective.

To justify their continued existence at a time when the army is supposedly cracking down on all private militias in the greater Beirut area and collecting their weapons, the Phalangists have been emphasizing the continuing threat from the Syrian and Palestinian forces in the Bekaa Valley and in northern Lebanon. They have made it clear that they will not even consider disbanding until these threats have been removed. 'Too Lazy and Too Meek'

Officials familiar with President Gemayel's thinking about the Phalangist militia, which was founded by his father, Pierre, say he is of two minds about it.

In the short run the President has no intention of even suggesting that it disband, because he is all too aware, as one Western military attache put it, that the ''Lebanese Army is too small, too weak, too lazy and too meek'' to take over security duties in the whole country right now. Thus there is a role to be played by the militia, which is viewed by Mr. Gemayel, at least, as a quasi-legitimate force.

In addition, Mr. Gemayel apparently believes that the Phalangist militia can serve as a tool for keeping pressure on the Syrians and the Palestinians in the Bekaa Valley to withdraw.

But when will enough be enough? Over the long term, Mr. Gemayel hopes that once the foreign forces are removed the desire of many Phalangist militiamen to return to civilian life and the fact that they will have no real enemies anymore will pave the way for their dissolution as a military force.

But it is a lot easier to start a militia than to take one apart, and the Phalangists have taken on a life of their own in the last decade. There is a hard-line core that could always find another enemy to justify its existence. Edmund Rizk, a Phalangist Party leader, has already suggested that the militia be maintained ''in order to remain a trustworthy guardian preventing the entry of any parasites or unwanted guests'' into Lebanon.

The Lebanese Malaise

There are many in East Beirut who do not want the Phalangist militia ever to disband because they consider it the only real guarantor of Christian security, and now predominance, in Lebanon.

Their attitude toward disbanding the militia is indicative of a certain enduring reality to this country. Lebanon is still only a loose conglomeration of religious groups, each deeply suspicious of the other. The last seven years of civil strife left this country much more deeply divided than is apparent at first glance.

There are now Maronite Christian children who have spent their formative years in East Beirut nurtured on hostility toward Moslems and Palestinians, whom they may have never even met. The same is true of Moslem children on the western side of the dividing line. Bombardment and Water-Skiing

The effects of this are palpable. At the height of the Israeli bombardments and blockade of West Beirut, people in East Beirut were sunning themselves on the beaches and water-skiing, oblivious to the fate of their countrymen less than two miles away.

And a few weeks ago in the mountain villages around Aleih, Christian Phalangist militiamen and Druze villagers fought over territory, just as their ancestors had been doing since 1860. Nothing had changed.

Lebanon's malaise runs far deeper than the presence of foreign troops. The troops are not the cause of Lebanon's problems, people here say; they are the effect - the effect of insecure religious communities constantly turning to outsiders for help against their internal foes.

''We never face reality,'' said Nabil Ghandour, a young Shiite bank manager. ''Each community defines Lebanon the way it doesn't want the country to be. One doesn't want it to be pan-Arab. Another doesn't want it to be sectarian. But we never define it as it really is and try to work from that reality. People just say we are all one big Lebanese family. We aren't.'' A Nagging Feeling

Despite the changes in the balance of power and the voices being raised for national reconciliation, one meets very few people here who are openly optimistic about the future. This is apparent in the hesitancy of businessmen to rush into new investments. People are pleased about the improved security, but there is a nagging feeling that it will not last.

The other day Rafik Shelala, the city editor of An Nahar, was asked his opinion about the prospects for Lebanon after the war. Mr. Shelala looked up from the pile of papers on his desk and asked innocently, ''Oh, you mean the war is over?''"
hey,"In a significant development in the conflict in Yemen, the pro-legitimacy Hadramaut elite forces are continuing Al Faisal Operation in Wadi Al Masini in Hadramaut.

Under massive aerial support provided by the Saudi-led Arab coalition forces’ fighter jets along with efficient contributions by the UAE forces, the Hadramaut elite forces have managed to entirely liberate the valley and expunged Al Qaeda militants from the area following a massive offensive.

The air force played an eminent role in bombarding the terrorist organisation’s strongholds, coupled with attacks by the land forces who showed full combat readiness in their fight against terrorism.

The Hadramaut forces gained full control over an operation room run by Al Qaeda militants in the valley and confiscated the equipment and ammunition used by the terror group in carrying out its criminal operations.

While combing the area, large caches of ammunition, including mortar guns and missiles were found and the Yemeni forces secured the entire zone by staging military posts and patrol units across the surrounding plateaus to pre-empt any counter-offensives by the terrorists.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO), with support from the Emirates Red Crescent (ERC), has begun distribution of medical aid and supplies to 20 health centres in 10 Yemeni governorates in the temporary Yemeni capital, Aden.

Some of the medical supplies were sent to health centres in Ash Shihr and Tarim in Hadramaut Governorate and Marib General Hospital, as well as to health centres in Al Khabr and Lawdar in Abyan Governorate and Mocha General Hospital in Taiz Governorate.

Dr Ali Al Waleedi of the Yemeni ministry of pulic health stated that the medical aid provided by the ERC to the WHO and distributed to 10 Yemeni governorates under the ministry’s supervision is part of the UAE’s ongoing support for the health sector in various Yemeni governorates, which has helped strengthen its performance and offered therapeutic services to the Yemeni people.

He also praised the UAE’s desire to support the health sector in liberated Yemeni cities and restore many key facilities that provide Yemeni families with essential services, such as electricity, healthcare and food, to the benefit of the Yemeni citizens.

Juma Abdullah Al Mazrouei, head of the ERC Team in Aden, said that the ERC has helped in restoring normal living conditions in Yemen, which reflects the support of the UAE wise leadership for the future of the Yemeni people, and their desire to ease the suffering caused by the Iranian-backed Houthi militias, as well as their efforts to provide for the basic living requirements of Yemenis.

He added that the UAE remains at the forefront of answering the calls of the authorities and social figures in the liberated areas in Yemen for urgent humanitarian intervention and aid for needy families, through launching hundreds of convoys carrying thousands of tonnes of food and relief aid, as well as implementing development projects that have eased the humanitarian suffering of local people.

Emirati ships also transported nine containers of medicine from the ERC, which arrived yesterday at Aden Port and were delivered to the WHO, to be distributed to various Yemeni governorates.

The UAE signed a partnership agreement with the WHO, valued at AED55 million, which includes the restoration of 20 hospitals and health centres in nine governorates, as well as the launch of a joint outreach campaign against polio, measles and other diseases in 11 governorates, valued at US$1.752 million while the UAE has helped combat a cholera epidemic in 23 Yemeni governorates."
hey,"The Senate rejected a resolution Tuesday seeking to end U.S. involvement in Yemen’s spiraling civil war, which has killed thousands of civilians and thrown the country into the “world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” according to the United Nations.

In a closer-than-expected result, lawmakers voted 55-44 against curbing U.S. military activity in Yemen, narrowly defeating the bipartisan legislation put forward by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. But human rights advocates were heartened by what they believe is a growing opposition to America’s unconditional support for Saudi Arabia’s controversial campaign in Yemen.

“Today should have been the day that the Senate moved to end U.S. involvement in this catastrophe.” said Scott Paul, Oxfam America’s policy lead for Yemen. “But it is clear from today’s debate that the tide is turning,”

Paul was likely referring to the timing of the vote, which, despite urgent requests from the White House and the Pentagon, took place just as Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman visited with President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump praised the young leader as a “very great friend” to America; hours later the Senate debated the bill.

Congressional leaders sought to use the Crown Prince’s much-touted visit to press the White House and its powerful Middle East ally to end the brutal war in Yemen, along with the U.S. military’s involvement in it. They did so while facing opposition from the executive branch and the military. Ahead of the visit, Secretary of Defense James Mattis penned a personal letter to U.S. senators, urging them to halt the vote, and warning that such an effort risked straining relations and compromising American interests in the region.

But there’s a reason the senators pressed forward with the vote. Bin Salman may be touted as Saudi Arabia’s young modernizing reformer, but he is also widely considered the architect of the Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen, which has had disastrous results for the country and its civilians.


The U.N. estimates that more than 8,750 civilians have died, with the majority of the deaths attributable to Saudi coalition airstrikes.

The U.S. has aided Saudi Arabia’s controversial air campaign from its inception, refueling coalition jets and providing intelligence and strategic support. The U.S. is also Saudi Arabia’s largest supplier of weapons, an aspect of the relationship that has received enthusiastic support from Trump.

With almost one-third of the estimated 16,000 Saudi coalition airstrikes since 2015 hitting civilian sites, monitors warn that the U.S. risks complicity in myriad potential human rights violations and war crimes.

“President Trump should recognize that by selling arms to a military force that is likely to use them unlawfully, he is putting U.S. officials at risk of aiding and abetting war crimes,” Kristine Beckerle, a Yemen researcher for Human Rights Watch wrote in a recent op-ed.

“This is a deeply destructive war,” added Adam Baron, co-founder of the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies. “There’s this tension with regards to whether U.S. involvement is either helping to end the war or extending the war further.”

The Saudi-led blockade has proved no less disastrous. Today, Yemen is considered the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis. More than 22 million people need humanitarian aid, including 8.2 million who are on the brink of famine, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Making matters worse, a cholera epidemic has swept through the country at lightning speed, infecting over a million people. Some 2,258 people died as a result of the epidemic between April 2017 and February 2018, according to the World Health Organization.

Still, advocates see a silver lining in Tuesday’s vote. Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen during the Obama administration, said the bill was “a reflection of growing anxiety over the humanitarian situation in Yemen and a sense that Saudi Arabia hasn't exercised its caution as it should under the laws of armed conflict.”"
hey,"Saudi Arabia’s U.S.-backed military campaign in Yemen, now almost three years old, not only drives the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, but also deepens the terrorist threat to the United States.

After more than 1,000 days of war, 22 million Yemenis—more than the population of Florida—need international aid, with over a third of those on the verge of starvation. The worst cholera outbreak in modern history has infected more than one million in just nine months, and on average five children are killed or injured each day from fighting, shortages, or disease. After a year of U.S. support for Saudi Arabia—including arms sales, refueling Saudi aircraft, and intelligence-sharing—the Trump Administration finally has begun to question the direction the conflict is headed."
hey,"“Life has dramatically changed in Yemen since the conflict started,” said Naji Saeed, a day laborer in the Taiz governorate. The construction work that was the source of Saeed’s livelihood has all but ended as a result of the conflict. “I lost my job like millions of Yemenis and I don’t know what I can do now to feed my children,” added Saeed.

Challenge

Yemen has been embroiled in civil war since 2015. Even before the conflict, Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the region. The last few years have created a full-scale humanitarian crisis. As of March 2017, approximately 60 percent of the total population was food insecure. Malnutrition has increased by 57 percent since the outbreak of the conflict. Many of those effected are children under five. Nearly half the population lives in areas directly affected by the conflict, and 80 percent are in need of humanitarian assistance. Basic services across the country are not-functioning and even aid delivery has been impeded by violence and security concerns.

Since the mid-1990s, Yemen’s national cash transfer program, the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) has played an important role in the country’s social protection system. It has provided vital support for the country’s most vulnerable families. Since the end of 2014, the SWF has been unable to operate. In response to this emergency, the World Bank and UNICEF have partnered to provide cash support to the former SWF beneficiaries.

Approach

The cash transfer project is supported by a US$200 million grant from the International Development Association (IDA-the Bank’s fund for the world’s poorest countries) in support of Yemen. It is part of an ongoing Emergency Crisis Response Project. The project is implemented by UNICEF and targets Yemen’s most vulnerable families by using the existing beneficiary list from Yemen’s SWF cash transfer program.

The IDA-funded project finances cash benefits and the technical assistance and services required to deliver them. UNICEF has engaged several private sector providers to support the delivery processes. The delivery of the cash transfers includes communication with beneficiaries and field facilitation of the process, along with identity verification and a system for addressing any grievances.

An independent, third-party organization has been contracted to ensure the project is maintaining standards of integrity and to verify payments. Case management and payments are implemented through both fixed sites and mobile teams for more remote areas. This allows for the cash transfers to be distributed across all of Yemen’s 333 districts. The first quarterly round of benefits ended in October 2017 and the second payment will be delivered in March 2018.

Results"
hey,"Yemen is becoming the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations. The divisive and violent civil war allowed the resurgence of militant jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State, especially since the security and governance vacuum following the Saudi-led coalition’s intervention in 2015.

[ LISTEN: What militant jihadist poetry tells us about Yemen ]

Over the past year, the United States and the United Arab Emirates have claimed several key counterterrorism victories against the Islamic State and AQAP. But those victories are more ambiguous than they appear at first look. My research illuminates that the specifics of the counterterrorism campaign and the broader impact of the war have empowered AQAP and other militant groups. Southern separatism, the ability of the Saudi-led coalition to control its proxies and power shifts within the internationally recognized government could all influence whether Yemen’s jihad groups continue to splinter or find common cause with disillusioned sectors of the population.

War empowers al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula

As the coalition campaign began, AQAP increased its numbers and war chest by staging a massive jailbreak, seizing military hardware and robbing the central bank. By April 2015, it had established a de facto state, which it ran out of Eastern Yemen. This continued for an entire year until UAE forces, with help from the United States, forced it to withdraw in April 2016.

[ Read More: Politics, governance and reconstruction in Yemen today ]

Populations in Yemen’s east are well armed and difficult to terrorize into submission. The key to AQAP’s success was not direct recruitment. Even at its peak, its core fighters numbered no more than 4,000. Rather, AQAP worked to secure buy-in from key city and tribal leaders and to win passive toleration from local populations. As coalition bombs rained down in Yemen’s west, crippled by the Saudi naval blockade, AQAP’s territory looked like a haven of stability.

Unlike the Islamic State, AQAP decided on a gradualist approach to governance and struck a local power-sharing deal. AQAP rebranded itself with a local name “The Sons of Hadramawt,” organizing a notable program of community projects. Most of AQAP’s governance Twitter feed during 2016 was about hands-on development activities (like providing access to water and electricity), while only 3 percent was about implementation of Islamic law punishments.

AQAP financed its activities through oil imports and smuggling operations along Yemen’s porous eastern coastline. Ironically, AQAP benefited from the Saudi naval blockade, since this gave it a virtual monopoly over imports and generated an estimated $2 million a day. AQAP also taxed local companies with the stated aim of improving community services.

AQAP has been careful not to alienate local populations. When innocent tribesmen were accidentally killed in operations designed to target the Yemeni military, AQAP published apologies and negotiated to pay blood money. The eruption of war in 2015 gave AQAP the opportunity to align itself against the Houthis, whom it had long deemed infidel allies of Iran. AQAP recast southerners’ historical fears of a takeover by northerners as a sectarian battle of Sunnis vs. Shiites. Political disputes were reframed as religious, within a narrative of apocalyptic jihad.

The high civilian death toll inflicted by the Saudi-led coalition allowed AQAP to pose as the good guy. Shortly after the United Nations temporarily blacklisted Saudi Arabia in 2016, AQAP promised not to target women or children. It has likewise exploited U.S. strikes and raids through youth outreach, including a competition in March 2016 for schoolboys to design anti-U.S., anti-drone posters.

The Islamic State is failing in Yemen

The Islamic State, which announced its expansion into Yemen in November 2014, has proven far less successful. Despite some early defections from AQAP, the self-proclamation of various Islamic State provinces around Yemen and headline-grabbing attacks in 2015 and 2016, the Islamic State could not compete with AQAP.

On the contrary, the arrival of the Islamic State onto the world stage actually worked to AQAP’s advantage. First, it redirected international attention away from al-Qaeda and Yemen to Iraq and Syria. Second, the brutality of the Islamic State made AQAP look reasonable. AQAP criticized the Islamic State’s indiscriminate attacks in Yemen — such as the 2015 double bombing of Friday prayers in Sanaa in which nearly 500 people were killed or wounded — and pledged not to target “mosques, markets and crowded places.”

Why did the Islamic State fail to gain traction in Yemen? Unlike AQAP, the Islamic State produced little culturally specific narrative and did not engage in community development projects. Islamic State fighters who have defected back to AQAP have lambasted the former’s bulldozer tactics.

Where does Yemen go from here?

Not everything is going well for militant movements in southern Yemen. The UAE and U.S. counterterrorism campaign has depleted both AQAP and Islamic State fighters in Yemen through death and desertion. Some of the jihadists’ former tribal collaborators now prefer to fight with the UAE-supported militias in exchange for a salary. AQAP statements and sermons warning local tribesmen that they will be targeted if they enlist with the new militias reflect this pressure. AQAP has also refocused its targets from the Houthis to the UAE-supported forces.

Cracks have started to appear in AQAP, with disagreements around corruption and leadership style. According to interviews conducted by this author on the ground during 2017, both AQAP and regional government officials are inextricably entwined with organized crime networks in Yemen’s east, profiting from the smuggling trade fueled by the booming war economy."
hey,"Despite Sweden leading a few special UN sessions in response to the acute humanitarian crisis in Yemen, it still has not demonstrated a political appetite to stop its arms sales to the most active warring parties in the Yemen war: Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Swedish parliament is due to discuss its governmental policies on Swedish arms exports, on the 28th of February – and anti-militarization Swedish groups are demanding that Sweden halts all its arms sales to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Human rights groups have documented serious attacks committed by both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis
In the course of the ongoing war in Yemen human rights groups have documented serious attacks committed by both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis against civilian sites. These attacks appear to have violated international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes. While the Houthis grew their military power ever since they overtook Sana’a on September 2014, with the support of Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Saudi-led coalition’s military activities in Yemen were only possible because of their weapon supplies from several western countries - including Sweden.

The Yemen Data Project reveals that since 2015, nearly one-third of Saudi air raids hit non-military sites; such as schools, hospitals, weddings, funerals among many other civilian targets. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both documented dozens of unlawful coalition airstrikes, some of which may amount to war crimes. And yet, Sweden has not taken any steps to, at least, investigate how its weapons might be used in violating the international humanitarian law and hence continues risking its complicity in these war crimes.

Sweden is among the world's top 30th biggest arms producers and both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are some of its main customers. According to the Swedish prominent 135-years-old anti-militarization group, Svenska Freds, the Swedish arms trade to Saudi Arabia has been ongoing since 1998; with a quick suspension in 2015 following a brief diplomatic crisis between the two countries. The greater amount of the trade has occurred in the last seven years. Between 2010 and 2016, the arms sales to Saudi Arabia was worth almost 6 billion Swedish kronor.

Additionally, the United Arab Emirates was able to buy Swedish weapons in 2016 after the Swedish administrative authority, National Inspectorate of Strategic Products (Inspektionen för strategiska produkter) granted a permission for arms trade to the United Arab Emirates for an amount of nearly 11 billion Swedish kronor, which is one of the largest grants of all time.

Prior to that deal, between 2010 and 2016, Sweden exported arms to the UAE worth 2,12 billion kronor. Saab Group (the Swedish aerospace and defence company) recently opened its office in the capital Abu Dhabi end of 2017 – a clear sign of Sweden’s desire to expand its activities in the region.

Sweden has not taken any steps to investigate how its weapons might be used and hence continues risking its complicity in war crimes

The Swedish foreign minister, Margot Walltröm has faced criticism at the Swedish parliament in late 2016 by Sweden’s Left Party, over Sweden’s role in peace-building and arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition. During that hearing, questions were raised about Sweden’s role in investigating committed war crimes and what initiatives the minister intended to take to introduce a national arms embargo against Saudi Arabia.

In response to these questions, the Swedish government has been working on presenting a proposal to tighten arms exports that could come into effect as a law in April of this year. However, this proposition does not deliver an absolute prohibition on arms trade to countries involved in armed conflict with possible war crimes committed.

Sweden should use its efforts to help find a solution, not add fuel to a burning fire
As both a Swedish-Yemeni citizen and an awardee of Svenska Freds’ Eldh-Ekblads Peace Prize for 2017, I take Sweden’s role in the war in Yemen very seriously. At the end of 2016 I urged Sweden to suspend its arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition and today I urge them again to do so. In the coming Swedish parliament debate on the arms exports, Svenska Freds group plans to demonstrate in front of the parliament to demand a halt on all arms trade related to the war in Yemen. And I raise that demand as well.

The ongoing war in Yemen has produced the worst humanitarian disaster since World War II and has the potential to get worse. A Recently published UN report shows how throughout 2017 alone there has been widespread violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law by all parties involved in the conflict. Both Norway and Finland have reviewed or suspended their arms trade with members of the Saudi-led coalition. Sweden should do the same. Sweden has long stood for peace and conflict resolution and it should use its efforts to help find a solution, not add fuel to a burning fire."
hey,"The Middle East today is poised between multiple wars fueling extremism and a burgeoning younger generation looking for a new start.

The era of American hyper-power is ending, Russia is back, and China is gingerly stepping in. The attention accorded to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the US and European stage this month is testament to Saudi Arabia's centrality to this new order.

Prince Mohammed has presented himself as a voice of moderation at home. But abroad, the story is different.

When the White House rolls out the red carpet for the newly empowered crown prince this week, President Trump must prioritize holding him accountable for his country's conduct on the world stage, starting with Yemen.

Yemen presents a catastrophic case study of what can happen when the center cannot hold. The country is consumed by at least five ""mini-sates"" at varying degrees of conflict with one another. Their conduct is ruthless and feeds radicalism, but the main players are deaf to pleas from the outside world to end the killing.

https://reader.chathamhouse.org/yemen-national-chaos-local-order#

Yemen has become synonymous with human suffering – over 22 million people need humanitarian aid, including almost every child in the country.

Saudi Arabia is not the only culprit in Yemen's descent into hell, but it is the most powerful player. While the Houthis are also guilty, nothing justifies the Saudi-led three-year bombing campaign that has destroyed hospitals and schools and killed countless civilians.

Since December's White House call to end the suffering, the Saudi-led coalition has carried out over 860 airstrikes in Yemen - one strike roughly every 100 minutes. More than one-third of these have struck civilians, including markets, farms and schools.

Riyadh has generously pledged almost $1 billion to the UN aid appeal for Yemen. But Saudi Arabia cannot play both arsonist and firefighter. Its behavior is damaging Saudi and American reputations, without making the region more secure. Instead, Al-Qaeda exploits the chaos to expand its foothold in Yemen, and Iran gains clout.

Saudi Arabia's de facto and longstanding blockade of Yemen's main Hodeidah port is, in spite of recent modifications, still preventing large quantities of food, fuel and medicine from reaching millions of people. Commercial flights to the country's main Sana'a airport have been similarly blocked for over 18 months.

In a country that imports almost 90% of its food and the majority of its medicine, the result has been 8.4 million people pushed to the brink of famine. The resurgence of deadly but preventable diseases, like a million suspected cases of cholera and a frightening diphtheria outbreak, have already reached 22 of Yemen's 23 governorates.

A UN panel of experts recently accused Saudi Arabia of using the threat of starvation as a weapon of war.

Our staff from the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council work every day to navigate a byzantine set of inspections and impediments to assist communities in desperate need. Just to travel between the country's two main cities, Aden to Sana'a, humanitarian agencies have to pass through more than 70 checkpoints. And spiking fuel prices due to low supply make the drive more expensive than ever. Several major medical suppliers have already stopped direct deliveries to Yemen, forcing organizations like ours to find alternative and complicated arrangements.

President Trump needs to make Saudi conduct in Yemen a priority in his talks. Three concrete steps are essential.

First, Trump must bring Saudi Arabia to its senses: piling human suffering on the people of Yemen is not strategic or defensible. Instead, commercial, civilian and humanitarian supplies need to flow freely to all parts of Yemen. This includes granting visas to aid workers and letting UN inspectors do their jobs. It also means demanding a permanent opening all Red Sea ports to commercial imports. The White House's past efforts that resulted in the blockade's temporary lifting proved half measures at best.

Second, President Trump must publicly commit US support to international efforts to restart peace talks. This includes empowering the new UN Special Envoy, and a new UN Security Council resolution that reflects current conflict dynamics, offers a more realistic framework for negotiations without preconditions, and demands an immediate ceasefire. Without a political settlement, the human suffering will plummet to new depths and continue to overwhelm responders like IRC and NRC.

Finally, Yemen needs more than a war economy. Aid organizations cannot be a substitute. This means replenishing hard currency reserves in Yemen's Central Bank as promised, and paying essential civil servants.

The US has a unique ability to influence Riyadh's actions. There have been some good words, but so far no effect. This is the moment for Saudi Arabia's closest ally to save it from further destruction, and the chaos that follows in its wake."
john,"Chicago. Its cultural richness is matched only by the depth of its history, and its deep-dish pizza’s renown is rivaled only by that of its idiosyncratic architecture. Chicago is unique. But this uniqueness?—?what makes Chicago singular and endearing?—?is not restricted to culture.

Chicago faces a unique set of political challenges. Chicago has, at the time of writing, witnessed nearly 650 homicides this year, nearing the 792 homicides in 2016. In October, the Chicago Tribune reported that close to 10,000 students had left the Chicago Public Schools system, indicating structural, systemic problems with the CPS. And these two issues only begin to scratch Chicago’s complicated political surface: there are numerous entrenched?—?often structural?—?problems that challenge the city greatly.

Chicago, long caricatured as a cliché of systematic political corruption, has its share of challenges. That much is clear. But what is less clear, at least to me (a naïve international student studying in the city), is how stuff gets done. Here is what I found.

The city’s political landscape is partitioned by executive and legislative branches. The Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, acts as the chief executive and the Presiding Officer of Chicago’s City Council. Under Mayor Emanuel are two other city-wide elected officials: The City Treasurer, currently Kurt Summers, and the City Clerk, currently Anna M. Valencia. The city’s legislative body, the City Council, is composed of 50 aldermen representing Chicago’s 50 wards.

Ordinances, resolutions and orders are the chief modes through which the City of Chicago takes official action. They are the meat of Chicago’s politics: what drive the city forward, and what unfortunately occasionally drive it wayward. They range from the city’s minimum-wage ordinance, which set the minimum-wage to rise gradually to 13 dollars an hour by 2019, to a food truck ordinance, banning food trucks from being within 200-feet of a brick and mortar restaurant.

Now that we know what the meat is, you might be wondering?—?to keep with the metaphor, I suppose?—?how that meat is cooked: how does an ordinance actualize? More precisely, how does policy go from theory to actionable legislation in Chicago?

AN EXAMPLE.
To answer that question, let’s traverse Chicago’s legislative process, contextualized with the help of an ordinance: Chicago’s stolen cell phone ordinance (record number: S02017–5522).

Introduced on July 26th and passed by the City Council on September 6th, the ordinance sought to amend the Municipal Code, modifying Chapters 4–240, 4–246 and adding section 8–4–053.

To the naked eye, these are meaningless numbers indicating equally meaningless indices in the Municipal Code, something that no one?—?no one in their right mind, at least?—?would read in its entirety. But behind these seemingly banal numbers is a piece of consequential legislation: an effort to dawn a crackdown on the secondary cell phone market by diminishing the value of stolen cell phones, theoretically minimizing phone-thefts as a result. Let’s see how it fared.

THE PROPOSAL.

All novel, worthwhile ideas require a precedent, a sine qua non that prompts action. And this ordinance was no different. In 2016, close to 14,500 cell phones were stolen in Chicago. That climate was, without doubt, viewed as problematic. It was certainly enough of a precedent to convince Mayor Emanuel and Alderman Ed Burke to draft an ordinance.

Boom. Was their work done at that point? It must have been. With Emanuel’s support and a senior alderman’s sponsorship, the ordinance would surely be immediately effectuated, right? That assumption would have been wrong?—?gravely wrong.

That is not to say that the statured-sponsors did not provide gravity to the ordinance?—?because they did. Instead, it is to say that Chicago’s government, like any other democratic political entity, is coated with checks and balances, protecting the city from political action that is not in the collective interest of its 50 wards. Well, wait. What are these checks and balances?

For one, there is the City Council. There are exceptions, but neither aldermen nor officials can bypass the council: it is a legislative whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

During the proceedings of a City Council session, aldermen, officials, city departments and even members of the public can propose legislation. And it is during one of these sessions, on July 26th, that Emanuel and Alderman Ed Burke introduced the ordinance.

In this assembly, Emanuel, in his capacity as the Presiding Officer, moved that the ordinance, along with others, be adopted in the omnibus. Because there were no objections, all of the ordinances were referred by the City Council to relevant committees?—?standard procedure.

Before an ordinance can be passed by the City Council as law, it is referred to a committee for approval without debate. This was the stolen cell phone ordinance’s outcome during July 26’s session: the City Council referred the ordinance to the Committee on Public Safety.

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

Because the ordinance was referred to the Committee on Public Safety, the committee became the controlling, overseeing legislative body. Committees, ranging from the Committee on Finance to the Committee on Pedestrian and Traffic Safety, are made up of aldermen. These aldermen orate reports at the beginning of City Council sessions, convene outside of them and oversee referred legislation.

When the Committee on Public Safety congregated on August 31st to discuss the ordinance, its members debated the legislation and heard from relevant stakeholders?—?as committees do. The majority of the committee approved of the ordinance, recommending it for passage by the City Council in full at a later date.

With approval from the Committee on Public Safety, the ordinance was forwarded to the City Council. On September 6th, the ordinance was the second item on the City Council’s agenda. It received a majority in City Council and the signature of Mayor Emanuel?—?the two conditions for passage. And so, it became law, a part of the Municipal Code.

THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

Theory had become actionable legislation and words had become statue, codified by the office of the City Clerk, at least temporarily.

The course to passage for legislation is not always this unbroken, however: it is not uncommon for legislation to get caught in an interminable circle of stiff-necked politicking and unfavorable legislative outcomes. Let’s take a look at things that could have prevented the ordinance’s passage?—?or, at the very least, made its existence more laborious.

After the City Council referred the ordinance to the Committee on Public Safety, the committee could have ignored it. If this were to have happened for 60 days, any member of the City Council could have then moved to discharge the committee from the matter. This motion would require 26 aldermen?—?in other words, the majority of the City Council.

If the ordinance’s immediate passage became necessary in spite of the Committee on Public Safety ignoring it, the aldermen could have bypassed the committee process in its entirety, suspending City Council rules. This emergency-circumvention would require the support of 34 aldermen?—?in other words, two-thirds of the City Council.

But even in the case of the ordinance’s passage, Emanuel does have the authority to veto the legislation within 5 days. Though inconceivable given that Emanuel himself championed the ordinance, let’s?—?for fun, I guess— pretend that Mayor Emanuel decided to veto his own ordinance:

Okay. Emanuel vetoed the very ordinance that he introduced, shocking all of Chicago. The City Council could have, at that point, quashed the veto if more than two-thirds of the aldermen opposed it. If less than two-thirds of the aldermen opposed the veto, the legislation would have failed and an indecisive Mayor would have been successful in vetoing his own ordinance. What a chain of events.

WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?
The problems that impede Chicago are very real, and they are being tackled by very real people with a very real legislative process at their disposal. The extent of the success of this tackling is another question entirely, one that can be debated endlessly, but we can be certain of this: Chicago’s elected officials have power. The city’s scarily intermittent history of corruption makes that clear.

The onus is on Chicago’s residents and constituents to be observant of this power. To be informed of the political magnitude of the offices to which officials are elected, and to be actively engaged in measuring their progress. To wildly misquote Thornton Wilder: there is a land of aldermen and officials and there is a land of Chicagoans, and the bridge is information, the only survival, the only meaning."
