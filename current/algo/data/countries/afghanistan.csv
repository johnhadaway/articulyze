0,afghanistan,"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani inaugurated the long-delayed distribution of electronic national ID cards Thursday, hailing it as an important step toward securing national elections, but his governing partner warned that the move could instead trigger a political and ethnic crisis.

While Ghani was rolling out the cards at a ceremony in his palace, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah declared at a news conference that the disputed design of the ID card “has not received the needed legitimacy and support from the Afghan people.” Such a “one-sided decision,” he said, can only lead to “more problems.”

The main point of contention has been the use of the word “Afghan” on the cards to refer to all Afghan citizens. The word was historically synonymous with Pash­tuns, the country’s largest ethnic group. Other groups, especially the second-most-numerous Tajiks, have objected that using “Afghan” would politically benefit Pashtuns.

The debut of the IDs, which was held up for several years by ethnic disputes and technical problems, came just six months ahead of scheduled parliamentary elections. A presidential contest is due to follow next year. Ghani is expected to run for reelection, and it is unclear whether Abdullah will back his rival or run against him for a second time.

The pre-election period has been plagued by other problems, including insurgent violence and low turnout for ID-card registration, that have left many Afghans worried that credible and safe elections cannot be held this year. Fraud marred the past two elections, and the 2014 contest between Ghani and Abdullah was so discredited that the two finally agreed to share power.

In the past month, two insurgent bombing episodes rocked the capital and took more than 75 lives. On April 22, a suicide bomber on foot detonated in a crowd of people waiting to apply for their ID cards, killing 57 and wounding scores. On Monday, two back-to-back suicide bombings in a ­high-security zone killed 25, including nine Afghan journalists who had rushed to the scene.

With concerns growing over election security and political stability, experts are debating whether it would be worse to have another high-risk, fraud-marred election or none at all. The consensus appears to be that it would be worse to have no elections because that would leave the power-sharing executive and the legislature in a state of legal limbo and foster public disenchantment.

Still, the high-level rift over the electronic ID cards has sabotaged hopes that the creation of a foolproof voting document would lead to more credible results — and help resolve protracted fights over the size of each ethnic group, by allowing people to choose among 15 groups to identify them on their cards.

The creation of a fair, inclusive and biometrically secure card was one of the first tasks set out by the national unity government, brokered by the United States after the 2014 contest collapsed. But three years and many delays later, the fight over what information should be on the card is ongoing.

Now the contradictory positions taken by Ghani, a Pashtun, and Abdullah, who is half-Pashtun and half-Tajik but is allied with a Tajik-based party, seem likely to exacerbate the feuding that has long divided the country into regional fiefdoms led by ethnic strongmen and has prevented a more modern democratic party system from taking root.

The disagreement is also likely to further discourage people from registering, even in urban centers that in theory are safer than rural regions under insurgent control. In the first two weeks that applications for voter IDs were open last month, a little more than half a million people signed up, while the potential number of eligible voters is estimated at more than 12 million.

“This . . . may turn into an ethnic crisis, and it will be a big opportunity for those who are playing ethnic cards,” said Najib Mahmoud, a scholar of law and political science. Such a development, he said, “would be a disaster for the country.”

New Afghan ID cards, aimed at unifying the country, are doing the opposite

1,afghanistan,"Officials from Afghanistan Central Civil Registration Authority (ACCRA) on Tuesday said that the body is expected to open an Electronic Identity Card (e-NIC) distribution center in Kabul in the coming days.

Although a nationwide roll out of e-NIC will take time, ACCRA is committed to speeding up the roll-out process across the country, said e-NIC spokesman Rohullah Ahmadzai.

But, a number of lawmakers in Afghanistan’s Wolesi Jirga (Lower House of Parliament), at a gathering in Kabul, have declared the roll-out process of e-NIC as illegal, saying that it will create division among the ethnic groups in Afghanistan.

“Please do not divide us because of your selfishness, people are equal and they live like brothers, we call on government to stop the delivery of ID cards,” said MP Zaheer Saadat.

“Continuation of this job will create a crisis, we call on the international community to address this issue,” said Jawed Kohistani, a political analyst.

This comes at a time that the e-NIC roll out has hit constant delays over the past few years due to political disagreements between Afghan political leadership.

“A center will be opened soon in a part of Kabul,” said Rohullah Ahmadzai, ACCRA spokesman.

“This action of government will split Pashtun people from Tajik people, and Hazara people from Uzbek people and will create division,” said Ramish Noori, another political activist.

The electronic national ID card system was officially launched in Kabul last Thursday when President Ashraf Ghani and the First Lady Rula Ghani were handed their cards.

The CEO of the National Unity Government (NUG) Abdullah Abdullah last week held a press conference and said the electronic ID card system was not legitimate and did not have the support of the Afghan people.

“The reason I have not participated in the distribution of electronic Tazkiras (ID cards) is that I know this process has not received the needed legitimacy and support from the Afghan people. A one-sided decision approved by all sides can only lead to crisis and more problems,” Abdullah said.

According to ACCRA, the electronic identity cards will be issued in six phases. The first phase will take six months in which the ID cards will be issued in five centers in Kabul. The next phase will entail ID cards being issued in the provinces.",Govt To Open e-NIC Center In Kabul Despite Backlash,https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/accra-plans-open-e-nic-center-kabul-despite-backlash

3,afghanistan,"(MENAFN - Afghanistan Times) The outlook of Afghanistan's water crisis is not good in the midst of a derelict water infrastructure and weak water management doctrine in Afghanistan and constant bullying of Iran to secure a bigger share of the country's waters. Decades of war have decimated much of the country. The water infrastructure has been overwhelmingly destroyed. Beside war, geographical constrains and foreign manipulations also add to the problem. Afghanistan's main river basins pour north to central Asia, east to Pakistan or west to Iran. Pakistan and Iran have spent billions in recent decades building dams and reservoirs to store water for consumption and power production. It is while Afghanistan is already wrestling with acute drought which has stricken most of the land-locked country. Last season barely saw sufficient quantity of snowfall and rainfall and the monsoon season has hardly had the expected intensity of precipitation. Drought is devouring the north, with dangerous impacts seen on the Helmand River. It is our irrefutable right to access to a fair share of our waters. Afghanistan's water needs precede that of others as the drought-stricken country is already in dire need and desperation. Based on a treaty entered into between Kabul and Tehran in 1972, Afghanistan should give Iran 26 cubic meters of water per second from Helmand River in non-crisis situations. But, when drought strikes, Afghanistan has the right – the treaty dictates – to restrict the outpouring of water to Iran. Any restriction on water outflow to Iran is a nightmare for Tehran as Kabul is deliberating an ambitious plan to build dams along its river. Considering the fact that most of the Helmand River water pours into Iran's barren and dry east, which is facing acute water scarcity, a curb on water outpourings could be devastating for Iran. This perceived threat has tempted Tehran to put pressure on Kabul to give up its water dam plans. Iranian president and foreign minister have warned Afghanistan on several occasions, underscoring Iran's deliberate effort to sabotage Afghanistan's grand projects. Self-reliance in the sphere of power production reasonably may seem unreachable, but minimal dependence on electricity imports is inevitable, so is an economic overhaul. If Afghanistan has the capability to use its waters. The capability of Kabul of utilizing its waters lies in two conditions; deterministic post-war infrastructure restoration and long-term efficient water management; and diplomatic supremacy and profound countermeasures to Tehran's offensive maneuverings. We need a robust water management system as much as we need water. Hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation will are at their lowest now could potentially improve if we retain a full control on our waters. The advantages of robust water system seem to outweigh those of any counter-productive diplomacy. It could resuscitate an ailing economy which is largely dependent on agriculture. Moreover, the backbreaking burden of power import costs will be reduced to minimum. The disadvantages of weak water management could impinge severe impact upon the economy. Afghanistan has a population of 29 million, with 79% of the population living in rural areas and mostly relies on farming. Northern Afghanistan is suffering from water scarcity and the ensuing drought has inserted collateral damage on farming. We could use moreover, power production is increasingly low and dependence on electricity imports from neighbors is drastically high. Building dams along rivers can enormously help deal with an increasing dependence on the Central Asia electricity.

After one year on the job, the Humanitarian Coordinator Toby Lanzer speaks about the huge disparities he sees, aid worker security and his personal commitment to Afghanistan.

While the number of mine casualties is on the rise, funding for mine action in Afghanistan dropped by 65 per cent over the past five years.

ACBAR’s Twinning Program successfully teams up international and national NGOs to build capacities to the benefit of both counterparts.

“It is a very tough place for aid agencies”

The Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, took up his function one year ago. Now, the top humanitarian official talks about his first 12 months in country, discussions in donor capitals, changes in the security environment, Twitter and what UN and NGOs can expect from him in the future. The interview was edited for length and clarity.

OCHA: What stands out about Afghanistan to you after one year?

Toby Lanzer: One striking issue are the disparities between life in Kabul, a few other urban centres and the rest of the country. Sitting in the heart of Kabul, working closely with senior Government officials, the international and NGO community, I am exposed to the vision and plan to create a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. But there is a gap between that and what the average citizen of the country lives every day. And there is an even greater gap between this vision and the plan and what people feel who were struck by violence, displaced by conflict or forced to return to this country.

That is why humanitarian action remains so necessary, so relevant and yet amongst senior officials, including myself, often understated. We are all so focused on the future – peace, stability and prosperity – that sometimes not enough attention is paid to the suffering of today. It has taken me a long time to understand that because I sit in the middle of the green zone. In my first year here, I managed to visit almost 20 provinces, increasingly by road, to connect with the girls and the women, the boys and the men of this country. And what they tell me is “Yes, slowly things are getting better, but we are suffering”

What has been your main challenge as Humanitarian Coordinator?

Amongst my different interlocutors [including from the development and political portfolio] much of the conversation is about the search for a political resolution – peace – and nothing is more important for the tomorrow of this country. The thing is that today, there are people going hungry. The hardest thing for me was to understand the scale and the depth of suffering because much of my time was focused on the development agenda, on peace, on elections. But the humanitarian agenda in Afghanistan is as important and will benefit from more of my attention in my second year here.

With all the strategic plans and frameworks that you are involved in that aim at improving the situation in Afghanistan, what do you want to achieve personally? How far do you want to go with and for the people of Afghanistan?

Far! I will always try my hardest in settings where I think there is hope and where I think there is a national capacity to manage situations. And clearly there is [in Afghanistan] and there is a plan to put in place a system that will enable the government to meet its responsibility. And so, I am willing to invest a lot of my energy, my time and to use my networks to draw attention to the good things that are happening in Afghanistan.

The past year was marked by a record high number of civilian casualties, several high-profile attacks including one on a NGO compound in Jalalabad. In your view, what has changed for the humanitarian community – for UN and NGOs?

I am not sure I would separate the two. It is important to remember that as terrible as the 31 May explosion was, and as awful as the January attacks were, these are just three incidents in a long list of tragedies that have befallen the people of this country, including the NGOs. Look at what happened to MSF in 2015 [when the hospital in Kunduz was bombed] or what happened to ICRC in February 2017 [when 6 staff members were killed and 2 abducted]. The security environment has become more complex with more players. This evolution complicates the setting and the extent to which we are safe. And every time we are less safe, we lose contact with communities. And every time we lose contact with communities and elders, we become less safe. [Afghanistan] is a very tough place for aid agencies to work. One of the hardest in which I have been.

What do you do to help the UN Agencies and NGOs to stay and deliver?

The humanitarian imperative demands that NGOs and UN Agencies are as close to suffering communities as possible. To enable that, we need to have conversations with all parties to the conflict. Those conversations are a major component of what I do. Managing risk as opposed to avoiding risk is a major part of what I do. Enabling UN Agencies to drive along roads as opposed to travelling by helicopter is something I promote to connect us to communities and reduce costs. Both of which I hope to enable us to provide more assistance to the people who need it most.

You toured the European capitals, meeting politicians and donors at the highest levels. Is Afghanistan on their radar? Are you rattling at a closed door?

I knocked on the door, it is open and I will be walking through it more frequently. That said, everyone in Afghanistan needs to recognize that Afghanistan is one of a dozen countries where humanitarian needs are high. Donor capitals are stretched. The case we make must be compassionate, yet compelling and concerted. Our messaging is getting better, but we are not there yet.

I never have worked in a country before where there is so much development financing in the absence of peace. That is a good thing, but we need to leverage the interest of development donors to gain at the same time a bit more compassion for the suffering today.

You are active on Twitter. Why do you tweet and what message do you want to share with your more than 20,000 Followers? I mix Tweets on humanitarian, development and cultural issues. I am really into positive messaging, to show a side of Afghanistan that is not only negative. I tweet pictures of people I meet, children, mountains or jewelry – things that lets people identify themselves with Afghanistan. I use two hashtags that I came up with: #AfghanistanCan and #BeautifulAFG.

I do not know exactly what it is, but I am picking up more followers and getting lots of interaction in the past few weeks.

You have said that for the first year, you will listen and learn. What can we expect for your second year? And what will you tell the humanitarian partners?

I will continue listening more than I talk. One cannot learn enough about this country in one year and my commitment is multi-year, like the Humanitarian Response Plan. I will keep listening but I will be saying a few more things, too.

What will you be telling the humanitarian community?

A handful of NGOs here deserve enormous credit for being close to communities in rural areas and saving lives. I will do everything I can to help them to stay, protect and deliver and to enable a few more NGOs to replicate that very good practice.

Anything else you want to add and share with the readers?

I never liked the word resilience and I don’t use it here [in Afghanistan]. I have no place to talk about resilience where everyone is more resilient than I could ever hope to be. I admire the strength, the pride, the commitment of the people of Afghanistan to survive the 40th year of violence. Amid this misery, listening to a father who says “I want my girl to go to school” proves to me that there is real hope for this country and this hope lies within the strength of its people.",Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin Issue 74 | 1 March – 31 March 2018,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-74-1-march-31-march-2018
6,afghanistan,"Last week, the U.S. military experienced three air crashes in the space of two days. On April 3, the U.S. Marine Corps lost a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter in the U.S. as well as an AV-8B Harrier jet in Djibouti. Four Marines were killed in the CH-53E crash while the pilot of the AV-8B managed to eject and was reported to be in a stable condition in Camp Lemonnier's medical facility. Those incidents were swiftly followed by the crash of an F-16 in Nevada operated by The Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force's flight demonstration team. Unfortunately, the pilot died in the crash.

The spate of deadly accidents raises questions about whether U.S. military airpower is in the midst of a crisis. Since the beginning of March alone, 14 service members have been killed in crashes. The deadliest of those incidents occurred when an Air Force HH-60 helicopter collided with power lines in western Iraq, killing seven airmen. Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, released a statement on Saturday saying that the ""readiness of the military is at crisis point"". When asked about the situation in a recent Pentagon briefing, however, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said that he is not prepared to characterize the crashes as evidence of a ""wave"" or ""crisis"", saying that each incident will be investigated.

The long list of incidents on the following infographic was recorded by website Task & Purpose and it makes for grim reading. The accident rate is not just a recent phenomenon and crashes have been frequent over the past year. In fact more service members were killed in air crashes between April 2017 and April 2018 than in combat in Afghanistan. During that time frame, 31 troops lost their lives to enemy action in Afghanistan while 47 service members died in air crashes. On top of two fatal collisions involving U.S. Navy vessels in busy shipping lanes last year, the higher than normal rate of air crashes suggests that some elements of the military have indeed reached crisis point.

Just one day after a double suicide bombing in Kabul killed at least 31 people and wounded scores more, a US military watchdog released a report with a set of dismal statistics on the US involvement in Afghanistan.

The report conflicts with the optimism projected by senior military officials, including US Defense Secretary James Mattis.",A new Pentagon report reveals the Afghanistan War isn't being won and American efforts are plummeting,http://www.businessinsider.com/war-in-afghanistan-isnt-being-won-and-american-efforts-are-plummeting-2018-5
8,afghanistan,"Even as US President Donald Trump laid down his Afghanistan strategy last year by increasing the number of American troops in the war-ravaged country; threatening Pakistan to pay the price if it did not in terrorists taking shelter on its territory and asking India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan to double the pressure on Islamabad to act in favour of the American interests.

But despite these measures and tough talks, Afghanistan's reality hasn't changed and instead, it has deteriorated further. Blasts have become a regular feature in the life of the Afghans and the casualties have already touched record levels. However, the killings of 10 journalists in a blast in Kabul earlier this week perhaps constituted the biggest worry over how things are going ahead (or back) in the war-torn country where the American forces have been functioning since October 2001.

The deliberate attacks on journalists in Afghanistan are a clear-cut approach to derail its democratic build-up.

But targeting journalists means the fourth pillar is under attack and that can potentially destroy the line of communication between Afghanistan internal scenario and the outer world. The terror attacks on journalists also deliver a terrible blow to the 'local'. i.e., reporters who know the ground reality better and can dig out details from zones that might otherwise be difficult for foreign correspondents to access. Journalists being soft targets, it also becomes that much easier for the terrorists to target them.

And if steps are not taken to protect the media from these terror attacks, then we might not see ever again a journalist like Ahmed Rashid braving all odds to report from Ground Zero and bringing to us the terrifying yet fascinating realities that exist deep within severely battered countries like Afghanistan. That will indeed be a sad day for journalism as well as the global movement for democracy.

But with the international community failing to reach a consensus on how to give peace a chance in Afghanistan, the task of providing shelter to journalists looks all the more daunting.

According to Reporters Without Borders, 34 journalists have been killed in Afghanistan in the last two years. It shows things haven't improved despite calls for renewed efforts from the heads of state of the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan to strive for peace.

The parties involved in Afghanistan have far too conflicting interests and this has given the terrorist elements all the freedom to thrive.

While the US has targeted Taliban and refuses to speak with them, Russia, China and Pakistan have backed the Taliban to defend their own interests - be it thwarting the Islamic State or other terrorists (in case of Russia and China) or India (in case of Pakistan).

As long as these state actors have no consensus on their Afghanistan policy, the non-state actors will have little reason to stop executing their own sinister plans.

The government of Afghanistan has remained perennially weak - politically and militarily - and that has been another major concern for the anti-terror forces in that country.

The internal tussles, corruption, military weakness to tackle the terrorists, etc. have meant that the US has to stay in the country and its presence makes it all the more difficult for achieving an all-encompassing peace.

Kabul's ordinary relations with Islamabad have not helped things either and even Pakistan's closest ally China has not been able to make them bridge the differences.

And as the Taliban continue to regain control over the majority of Afghanistan, pushing the government's relevance to the corner, the entire crisis returns to square one.

With so many loopholes to plug, it seems virtually impossible for the international community to resolve the Afghanistan crisis even as the war in that country is in its 17th year. And the failure of the political leadership leaves the media uncovered and vulnerable.

9,afghanistan,"SITUATION OVERVIEW

The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continued to remain grave in 2017 despite a reduction in needs at the mid-year mark from 9.3 million to 7.4 million. By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar province which registered a 310 percent increase in the numbers of internally displaced over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) and coalition forces’ escalating campaign to defeat non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in the eastern region. Soaring suicide attacks and airstrikes – which increased by 50 percent and 68 percent respectively on 2016 – as well as more targeted NSAG assaults on military checkpoints and infrastructure also contributed to rising trauma cases.

Although overall civilian casualties decreased by 9 percent, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured). As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 percent of all civilian casualties. Unlike in 2016, however, when ground engagements comprised the largest proportion of deaths and injuries, combined improvised explosive device (IED) tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – accounted for 40 percent (4,151) of the total, highlighting the dangers posed to the population by NSAGs who, under increasing military pressure in the regions, are now resorting to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 included the forced closure of healthcare facilities by NSAGs as part of efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants, and which denied up to 1.4 million people (65 percent of them female) from access to essential services at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed or inactive due to the conflict according to the Ministry of Education. In order to address these issues and facilitate the creation of a protective environment in which Afghans are safe and free to go about their lives without fear of violence or harm, the protection cluster, in consultation with the HCT and ICCT, is developing a protection strategy in early 2018 to promote measures which support the reduction of civilian casualties and increase compliance with International Humanitarian Law / International Human Rights Law. These include the development of action plans and related advocacy to support the implementation of the National Policy on Civilian Casualty Prevention and Mitigation and the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, both recently endorsed by the government.

Despite initial projections of 1 million returns from Pakistan in 2017, an improved protection environment saw the arrival of just 156,140 Afghans in 2017 (98,140 undocumented returnees and 58,000 registered refugees). The decision of the Federal Cabinet of Pakistan in January 2018 to nevertheless issue the first ever 30-day extension of Proof of Registration cards to 1.4 million Afghan refugees prompted fears that a mass return was possible, if not imminent, and led to the development of an inter-cluster contingency plan to support 700,000 returnees with immediate humanitarian assistance totaling USD 198 million. Despite the Cabinet’s subsequent extension of PoR cards to 30 June 2018, the situation of Afghans in Pakistan remains precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities. Partners on both sides of the border are currently monitoring the protection space for any signs of deterioration. While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, the tendency for existing returnee populations to settle in and around Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province – when combined with the significant numbers of internally displaced – has led to a doubling of the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66). As of November, more than 750,000 displaced populations lived in informal settlements in Nangarhar province, up from 429,000 in February, two thirds of which are concentrated in the two districts of Behsud and Sukhrod.

While natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected (a 20 percent reduction), the arrival of the La Niña weather effect at the end of 2017 has led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping season, leaving as many as 1 million people at risk of exposure to drought. In response, the ICCT has developed a contingency plan to provide emergency assistance (both in-kind and in cash) – totaling USD 110.4 million – to the most vulnerable households living across the 20 worst affected provinces.

Overall in 2017, humanitarian partners delivered life-saving assistance to 4.1 million people affected by conflict and natural disasters, sudden population movement and the effects of decades of underdevelopment and chronic poverty.

Humanitarian assistance was primarily delivered through medical care to the war wounded; emergency survival supplies of food, water and shelter to displaced and returnee populations, including multi-purpose cash grants (of which USD 35.9 million was disbursed) and sectoral support such as cash for food and cash for rent. As in previous years, humanitarian resources were also dedicated towards gapfilling for the provision of basic services, including healthcare and nutrition, with funds primarily targeted towards the 9 million people – approximately 40 percent of the population – affected by insufficient coverage of nationally-led systems or living in conflict-affected white areas.

Overall, the HRP received USD 320.7 million in committed funds representing 78 percent of overall requirements, making it the second highest funded HRP globally. As in previous years, the well-defined parameters of the plan, which focused on the provision of life-saving assistance, continued to resonate with donors who recognise the ongoing need for immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to be provided to populations for whom no alternative lifeline exists. The dedicated use of the 2nd CHF allocation 2017 to improve humanitarian response in hard to reach areas also helped to address existing imbalances in assistance provided to crisis-affected populations living in government and nongovernment held areas, the latter of which have typically been underserved in Afghanistan. During the year, humanitarian partners implemented programmes in almost 50 percent of all hard to reach districts (100) reaching more than 240,000 people in the process with emergency relief and protection assistance.

Despite these successes, a number of challenges remained.

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016 – when an unprecedented 675,000 were forced to flee their home – challenges with the existing IDP petition system led to some delays in the provision of emergency assistance and concerns that alternative models of IDP identification may be required in the future. At the same time, continued internal displacement, combined with ongoing returnee influxes, have contributed to a significant rise in the number of people residing in informal settlements, reinforcing the need for durable solutions which support reintegration, including the allocation of land and adequate housing and for which finalisation of an Executive Decree is still pending.

Indeed, with both short and long-term objectives now being pursued in parallel, Afghanistan is a defining example of the humanitarian-development nexus. Moving forward, it will therefore be a test of the humanitarian community’s ability to work in close cooperation with all relevant actors (including the UN, NGOs, development partners, the World Bank and donors), and with the government at both national and regional levels, to define collective outcomes and integrated responses, through multi-year joint planning which reduce needs, vulnerability and risk while at the same time building resilience.","Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan 2017 Year-End Report of Financing, Achievements and Response Challenges (January - December 2017)",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-response-plan-2017-year-end-report-financing

Online news portal The Quint reported on Monday quoting sources that the Indian engineers kidnapped in Afghanistan over the weekend were being held in the Taliban-controlled village of Dand-i Shahabuddin on the northern fringes of the town of Pul-i Khumri in Afghanistan's Baghlan area. The portal reported that the negotiations between the Baghlan authorities and the kidnappers seemed to have derailed following tremendous media attention.

""Early on Sunday, Qari Bakhtiar said the kidnapping of the men was a mistake, and they would be released soon, but later on Sunday, as the kidnapping acquired a higher media profile, negotiations stalled,"" said an anonymous senior Baghlan official, as quoted by The Quint.

An earlier report had suggested that local authorities had begun negotiations with Qari Bakhtiar (a Kunduz-area ethnic Pashtun who serves as the Taliban's deputy chief for the Baghlan area) using a committee of village elders and clerics from Dand-i Shahabuddin as mediators in an effort to secure the release of the men.

The abducted Indian engineers of the company KEC International had been working on a World Bank-funded project in Afghanistan in a war-torn area that somewhat falls under Taliban-controlled territory.

KEC International, a subsidiary of the RPG company, was among two Indian companies that won a $235.16 million contract in 2017, from Afghan state-run power firm Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat, to build the CASA-1000 power line project, linking Pakistan via Afghanistan to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

As per an early arrangement between the Afghan government and the Taliban, the project was continuing under the understanding that once installed, power would be supplied to villages under their control, including Sang Soragh, Karadak, Alikhel, Zahrabi, Kamra and Dand-i Shahabuddin.

Meanwhile, some social media users have blamed the abduction on India's neighbor and rival Pakistan.

Situation Overview

IOM is responding to a substantial increase in the return of undocumented Afghans from Pakistan and Iran. Since 01 January 2018, over 254,718 undocumented Afghans have returned due to diverse push factors, including deteriorating protection space in Pakistan and Iran. Most of those returning have lived outside of Afghanistan for decades, and will need support from the government and humanitarian actors both on arrival and as they seek to reintegrate. As the rate of return is influenced by a number of political, security and other related factors both in Afghanistan and neighboring countries, another surge in returns could occur at any time. The governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan together with UN counterparts have now extended Proof of Registration cards for 1.4m Afghan refugees in Pakistan to 30 June 2018 and have begun the issuance of Afghan Citizenship Cards on 16 February for more than 850,000 undocumented Afghans. IOM is working to scale up its support to returnees in coordination with the Government of Afghanistan and other humanitarian partners in line with the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).",Return of Undocumented Afghans - Weekly Situation Report (29 April - 5 May 2018),https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/return-undocumented-afghans-weekly-situation-report-29-april-5-may-2018

HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT

Humanitarian situation in 2017

The continued deepening and geographic spread of the con-flict, unrelenting displacement and exposure to repetitive shocks intensified humanitarian needs throughout the year. The key drivers of humanitarian needs were the underlying vulnerability due to the protracted crisis, escalating emergen-cies, closure of health care services, shattered resilience, nat-ural disasters and cross border migration.

Armed Conflict

The intensification of the conflict, combined with a surge in sectarian violence, led to extremely high numbers of war wounded on both sides of the conflict. Although overall civilian casualties decreased by nine per cent from last year, 2017 was the fourth consecutive year with more than 10,000 casualties (3,438 deaths and 7,015 injured), with 231,489 people receiving trauma services of some kind. As in previous years, the conflict continued to exact a heavy and disproportionate toll on women and children, with the latter making up 30 per cent of all civilian casualties. Combined improvised explosive device tactics – including suicide and complex attacks – ac-counted for 40 per cent (4,151) of the total, in contrast to 2016 when ground engagements comprised the largest pro-portion of deaths and injuries. Non-state armed groups (NSAGs), under increasing military pressure in the regions, re-sorted to asymmetric warfare and inflicting greater harm on areas once considered secure, particularly the capital Kabul.

Natural Disasters

Natural disasters are a recurring phenomenon in Afghanistan affecting on average one quarter of a million people per year. In 2017, natural disasters followed similar patterns to 2016 with 58,000 people affected. Although this was a 20 per cent reduction from 2016, avalanches, snowfall and flooding caused significant damage to homes and livelihoods in 22 out of 34 provinces.

The La Niña weather effect led to the second successive year of low rainfall and the loss of the entire winter cropping sea-son, leaving as many as one million people at risk of exposure to drought. Each year the country incurs agricultural losses of approximately $280 million due to natural disasters, and it has been estimated that a severe (once in a lifetime) drought could raise this to $3 billion.

Internal Displacements

While displacement in 2017 did not occur at the same rates as in 2016, displacement continued to have an impact on the demographic composition of large parts of the country. In some areas, particularly those where the Islamic State of Khorasan (ISK) is present, people have taken it upon them-selves to pre-emptively leave before being forced to do so.

By the end of the year some 507,000 Afghans had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, almost a quarter of in Nangarhar Province which registered a 310 per cent increase in the numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) over 2016, mainly due to the Afghan National Defence Security Forces and coalition forces’ campaign to defeat NSAGs in the Eastern Region.

Cross Border Influxes

With exposure to protection risks on both sides of the border, 156,140 Afghans returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan, as well as approximately 395,000 Afghans returned from Iran, during 2017. The situation of Afghans in Pakistan remained precarious and subject to political dynamics and the continued acceptance of host communities, whilst families returning to Afghanistan were almost entirely dependent on ex-tended family networks and internationally funded assistance upon arrival.

While return figures in 2017 were less than expected, returnee families had limited ability to return home or to their ancestral places of origin. They were left with little choice but to occupy the vast and growing number of informal settlements which populate Afghanistan’s urban landscape. As in 2016, Afghan families returning from Pakistan tended to settle in and around Jalalabad City in Nangarhar Province which, when combined with the significant numbers of IDPs doubled the number of informal settlements (from 29 to 66), resulting in overcrowded conditions with increased food insecurity and decreased access to water and sanitation facilities.

Security and access constraints

2017 bore witness to violations of international human rights law with deliberate attacks on civilians and public facilities, including aid workers and schools and medical facilities frequently reported. Other concerning trends which increased in 2017 were the forced closure of at least 147 healthcare facilities by NSAGs. Their efforts to extract improved medical treatment for their combatants denied access to essential services to up to 1.4 million people (65 per cent female) at any one point. Attacks on other forms of civilian infrastructure, or the threat thereof, also continued unabated with as many as 1,000 schools closed/inactive due to conflict.

Following years of growing insecurity in Afghanistan, many aid agencies adopted coping strategies that either ‘bunkerise’ or ‘localize’ their operations. This led to ‘access inertia’ in the humanitarian response, with agencies avoiding the risks associated with working in insecure and contested districts, resulting in a lack of assessment and response for those communities.",Afghanistan Common Humanitarian Fund - Annual Report 2017,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-common-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2017

Active fighting resulted in internal displacement of 36 families in Kandahar and 101 families were displaced due to a flood in the same city.

The deteriorated security situation in the Southern region resulted in an increased number of closed health facilities.

“I don’t want to comment on figures of civilian casualties provided by Unama,” said Shah Hussain Murtazawi, President Ashraf Ghani’s deputy spokesman. “Our investigation also shows that there were some civilian casualties, but the main target was the Taliban gathering.”

Mr. Murtazawi said he could not provide further detail, however, because the government’s own report had yet to be formally presented to the president’s National Security Council. He said that the Kunduz attack had prompted the government “to take more measures to prevent civilian casualties in airstrikes,” but he did not specify what those measures were.

Ms. Gossman, of Human Rights Watch, said, “The government seems wary of releasing information about large numbers of civilian casualties, since to do so means confronting those in the security forces responsible.”

The United Nations in Afghanistan has also criticized the insurgents, blaming them for the majority of civilian casualties in the war, particularly from suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices that often deliberately target civilians. The latest United Nations report said 67 percent of civilian casualties could be attributed to the insurgents.

Until recent months, most aerial attacks in Afghanistan were carried out by American-led coalition forces, and many still are, though with increased standards of caution to avoid civilian casualties, according to American officials. At least four American airstrikes in Kunduz in recent years resulted in claims of civilian casualties.

In one hotly disputed attack just outside Kunduz city last November, the American military launched airstrikes after two of its soldiers had been killed, apparently killing civilians who had been ordered by the Taliban to recover the dead and wounded. The United States at first denied killing any civilians, but reversed its position after an investigation and said 33 civilians had died in the incident.

The American commander, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., apologized for the loss of life.","Afghan Airstrike Said to Target Taliban Mostly Killed Children, U.N. Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/asia/afghanistan-airstrike-children.html
